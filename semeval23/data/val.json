The next game in the franchise, Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location, was scheduled to release this coming Friday, October 7th, but if developer Scott Cawthon is to be believed, the project has been delayed by a few months.","According to a post by Cawthon on the Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location Steam page, the game is being delayed because it\u2019s too dark. Cawthon said that some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick, and so he is thinking about delaying the game so that he can rework it entirely \"into something kid-friendly.\"","Delays happen in the gaming industry all the time, but it\u2019s rare for a game to be delayed mere days before its release. Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s fans are confused and angry about this latest development, as many were looking forward to playing the game on Friday. Something else upsetting fans is Cawthon\u2019s reasoning that the game is too dark to release, as being dark and disturbing are two characteristics that many consumers look for in a horror game.","Cawthon\u2019s reason for suddenly delaying Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s Sister Location from its planned October 7th release date doesn\u2019t make much sense. A more likely scenario is that this is just a weird publicity stunt meant to hype the game as being so disturbing that its developer almost didn\u2019t even release it. Alternatively, perhaps Cawthon is delaying the game for technical reasons and decided to concoct this story instead of admitting that the fifth core game in the series has issues.","Fans should also consider the possibility that Cawthon is just trolling in an attempt to throw them off the scent of an early release. Cawthon has a habit of surprising fans by releasing Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s games early, and it wouldn\u2019t be all that shocking for Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location to carry on that tradition, despite Cawthon\u2019s post to the contrary.","With October 7th just a few days away, fans will learn soon enough whether or not Cawthon is serious about Sister Location\u2018s delay. If the game is delayed, it will be interesting to see if Cawthon actually does rework it to be more \"kid-friendly,\" or if he goes with a slightly altered version of his original vision.","Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s: Sister Location is scheduled to launch on October 7th for PC as well as iOS and Android mobile devices.","Source: Scott Cawthon"],"targetTitle":"Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s Sequel Delayed for Weird Reason","targetDescription":"Five Nights at Freddy's creator Scott Cawthon takes to Steam to tease a possible delay for Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location, the fifth game in the series.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets.jpg","https:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-UeXruRVtZz7w6.gif","https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/themes\/9.0\/images\/logo-3.png","https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-puppets-700x389.jpg","https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Five-Nights-at-Freddys-Cover-Art.jpg","https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/five-nights-at-freddys-sister-location-clown-animatronic-700x389.png","https:\/\/gamerant.com\/wp-content\/themes\/9.0\/images\/logo-4.jpg"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/gamerant.com\/five-nights-at-freddys-sequel-delay\/?utm_content=inf_124_3412_2&utm_source=Facebook&utm_medium=Partner&utm_campaign=SocialEdge&tse_id=INF_e34a10a08b0811e6b6db4d0235f40af5","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"They think It's too dark. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Gaming"},"spoiler":["some of the plot elements are so disturbing that they are making him feel sick"],"spoilerPositions":[[[2,158],[2,236]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":0}
{"postId":"4jp20e","postText":["Why Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio\u2019s fate could hang on a single word"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["\u00a9 REUTERS\/Laura Segall Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio announces newly launched program aimed at providing security around schools in Anthem, Arizona, January 9, 2013. PHOENIX \u2014 A single word \u2014 \"intentionally\" \u2014 could transform a court case against Phoenix-area Sheriff Joe Arpaio from civil charges to a criminal prosecution.","In finding Arpaio and three of his top commanders in contempt of court on Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Murray Snow said no fewer than 19 times that the sheriff or his aides had repeatedly and intentionally violated judicial orders to stop profiling Latinos. On May 31, Snow will determine the civil penalties and examine whether Arpaio, the sheriff of Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County, will be referred to Arizona\u2019s U.S. attorney for potential criminal charges.","Arpaio has acknowledged violating Snow\u2019s order, but said it was a mistake. In weighing criminal charges, Snow must decide whether Arpaio\u2019s violations of his orders were intentional.","In the meantime, the judge had unusually harsh words for Arpaio.","\"The Defendants\u2019 unfair, partial, and inequitable application of discipline disproportionally (sic) damaged members of the Plaintiff class,\" Snow wrote.","In a 2011 civil case brought by Latino drivers against Arpaio and his aides, Snow determined that Arpaio had encouraged his deputies to subject Latino drivers to greater scrutiny during traffic stops than white drivers typically received. He ordered the sheriff to put an end to the practice.","Two years later, Snow found that Arpaio had continued the practice in violation of the order. At a Houston rally the next year, Arpaio told supporters that he had violated the order \"out of spite\" and had arrested 500 people.","He later said in court filings that he had violated the order unknowingly.","In Friday\u2019s ruling, Arpaio was held in contempt on three counts. Chief Deputy Jerry Sheridan was found in contempt on two counts, and retired Chief Brian Sands and Lt. Joe Sousa each were found in contempt on one count.","\"The Court finds that the Defendants have engaged in multiple acts of misconduct, dishonesty, and bad faith,\" Snow wrote. \"In their testimony during the evidentiary hearing, Sheriff Arpaio and Chief Deputy Sheridan made multiple intentional misstatements of fact while under oath.\"","In hearings last year, Arpaio, the octogenarian who calls himself \"America\u2019s toughest sheriff,\" seemed to wither under questioning, particularly when asked about an effort he had made to investigate the judge.","A lawyer for Arpaio had hired a private investigator to look into comments Snow\u2019s wife purportedly made in a restaurant, where an informant claimed she had said the judge didn\u2019t want to see Arpaio reelected.","Arpaio apologized to Snow for the investigation, but the sheriff\u2019s attorneys also used the incident to argue that Snow was no longer impartial and should recuse himself from the case. Snow declined.","In his contempt ruling, Snow said Arpaio and his aides failed to turn over video evidence to plaintiffs in the civil case, disobeyed orders to gather evidence and continued to profile Latinos.","Snow found that Arpaio hid thousands of pieces of evidence from the plaintiffs and deleted relevant digital evidence kept on hard drives.","Longtime opponents immediately called for the sheriff to resign.","\"Any public official who has been found guilty of racial profiling and ignores the orders of the court cannot be entrusted with the safety and well-being of the community and should step down in shame,\" the immigrant rights group Puente Arizona said in a statement Friday.","The ACLU, which brought the original case against Arpaio, demanded stricter oversight and transparency from the sheriff\u2019s office.","\"Strong remedies are needed to protect the community\u2019s rights, starting with internal investigations that root out and punish misconduct,\" said Cecillia Wang, director of the ACLU\u2019s Immigrants\u2019 Rights Project. \"Willing or not, the sheriff will be made to comply with the law.\"","The ruling Friday was one of Arpaio\u2019s most serious defeats, but it doesn\u2019t bar him from holding office, and he had already announced his intention to run for a seventh term as sheriff in November."],"targetTitle":"Why Arizona Sheriff Joe

Is there such a thing as too much? And what if you got a discount on the service? But knowing how much to tip your hairdresser has to be one of the more confusing tip scenarios out there, especially if you get your hair done at a salon where more than one person works on your strands.","Below, once and for all, is a definitive guide to tipping your hairstylist \u2014 and their assistant, shampooist, and everyone in between. Thank us later \u2014 no tip necessary.","If you need a simple baseline, experts agree that tipping 20% is standard and acceptable at any hair salon. If you\u2019re in a smaller town, 15% may be the norm. You can always ask the receptionist at your salon what\u2019s typical, or ask on the phone when you call to make your appointment.","Offering the person who shampoos your hair $3 to $5 is a nice gesture. You can hand the money directly to the shampooist, or give it to the receptionist when you check out and ask them to pass it along.","As for your stylist\u2019s assistant, that person is likely in training and may not be making much money, so Michelle Lee, master designer and manager at Salon Eva Michelle in Boston, recommends tipping them between $5 and $20.","\"All the assistants are there in training to be stylists, and at many places, a lot are working at minimum wage, so anywhere from $5 to $20 is fine depending on how much they end up doing for the client, or if they have been especially gracious to you,\" she told InStyle.","Try to bring cash to tip, if possible. Not every credit card machine will allow you to add a tip, and using cash will make it easier to tip the different people who worked on your mane. And yes, it\u2019s OK to tip even if your hairdresser is the owner of the salon.","Also, if your salon offers free bang touch-ups, consider bringing a few dollars to leave as a thank-you gesture. Your stylist will look fondly on you next time you come into the salon.","If you\u2019re a woman with shorter hair \u2014 meaning you get it cut and\/or colored regularly \u2014 your stylists will understand if you offer a slightly smaller tip. After all, your annual bill is much higher than a longer-haired client\u2019s.","As for tipping on a discounted service: Stylists are split on the issue, with some suggesting a 20% tip on the original price of the service, and others saying a tip of 20% on the discounted rate is fine, since the goal is to get you back into the salon. When in doubt, ask at the front desk!","Finally, if you\u2019re unsatisfied with your haircut, communicated what you wanted to your stylist, and talked to them about how to fix it but they refused to make changes, you can definitely lower your tip. If they invite you back for a fix-up cut, though, etiquette expert Peggy Post suggests offering a tip of 15-20%."],"targetTitle":"Here\u2019s how much you should be tipping your hairdresser","targetDescription":"Remembering how much you\u2019re supposed to tip\u00a0anywhere can be hard \u2014 what do current trends dictate?

Opened in 1973 in downtown Manhattan's East Village, the nightclub that originally intended to house country, bluegrass and blues music (hint its acronym) quickly became a breeding ground for bands like The Ramones, Talking Heads and The Police, among countless others.","The legacy of the club, which closed in 2006 over a rent dispute, is on display in a new movie that stars Alan Rickman as bemused owner Hilly Kristal. It's a bit of a departure for anyone more accustomed to seeing Rickman, 67, play sinister Severus Snape in \"Harry Potter\" or Judge Turpin in \"Sweeney Todd.\" The movie also afforded him the opportunity to reunite with fellow Hogwarts alum Rupert Grint, who portrays one-third of derriere-bearing punk band The Dead Boys, alongside Justin Bartha and Bronson Adams. They're joined by a revolving door of notable faces, including Malin Akerman as Debbie Harry, Taylor Hawkins as Iggy Pop, Johnny Galecki as Terry Ork and Ashley Greene as Hilly's daughter Lisa.","HuffPost Entertainment snagged some phone time with Rickman and Grint, who were candid about their unfamiliarity with CBGB's legacy but effusive about the excitement that came with reconvening for the project. Plus, Grint talks about his own punk phase and Rickman explains what Halloween used to mean for him.","What are you up to today?","Rickman: I'm in New York. I'm just here for three or four days for \"CBGB\" in New York and then back to work in England.","Grint: I'm rehearsing a play that will start [in London] in a couple of weeks. Yeah, so that's it.","Are you enjoying the theater work? Are you more of a theater guy or a film guy?","Grint: I don\u2019t know, really. This is my first theater experience, and it\u2019s very different. I wanted to just try it; it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. Just the thought of it scares me. I\u2019ve kind of put it off for a long time, and I just thought it was a good time to do it. And it\u2019s a great play and a really great cast with a great director, and it was just, yeah, I\u2019m enjoying it.","Were you familiar with the legacy of CBGB as a breeding ground for the punk-rock scene prior to taking your roles in the movie?","Rickman: I wasn\u2019t familiar with CBGB at all. I didn\u2019t know about it and didn\u2019t know its history. I hadn\u2019t even really heard those four letters put together because at that time I was very much in England as a drama student and an art student, so it\u2019s all been a new discovery to me. Obviously I was aware of some of the bands, but not that they\u2019d all started in a club on the Bowery.","Grint: I didn't actually know a lot about it. I'd obviously heard of the name and the logo and seen it on T-shirts and stuff like that, but I didn\u2019t really know how prolific it was in discovering some of my favorite bands. I love Talking Heads, and the whole punk thing was something I really loved. So, yeah, it was quite an education learning about it. And also Dead Boys, I wasn\u2019t really familiar with them, and kind of listening and watching them on YouTube was amazing. They just had so much energy, and they were just disgusting. It was incredible.","Did you grow up listening to the music depicted in the movie?","Rickman: Obviously I was aware of the huge rise of The Police in England, and as an art student I was very much a fan of Talking Heads. And then Blondie, but I wasn\u2019t a hard punk-rock fan at the time. But of course I was also very much around the height of The Beatles and The Stones, so it was like that was the lone star and everything spun off from there. And [Bob] Dylan, very much so. ... England in the \u201860s and the \u201870s was everything that history has said; it was phenomenally exciting, musically. One was very shaped by that.","Grint: It was that whole era that I liked. I like, obviously, The Sex Pistols and The Clash, Blondie as well, and The Ramones. Some amazing people performed on that stage. ... I went through a real punk phase not that long ago, and yeah, it was probably the reason why I decided to do it, because I have such a love for that.","Did you dress similarly to the character that you play at any point?","Grint: [Laughs] No, not at all. The dog collar was a new experience for me.","Not knowing much of the mythology of CBGB, how did you come to learn about your characters?","Rickman: What I really enjoyed and what made it interesting to play was the fact that he happened in direct contrast to the world of the club and what its history became. Because there was this big quiet, contained man who made a club for country music and it never ever played there. Along came punk, and he became like that deus ex machina, I suppose. I watched old interviews and DVDs. I listened to him talking to his mother and his daughter and journalists, so there was a lot of material for me.","Grint: Yeah, there wasn\u2019t really a whole lot to go on. There are a few videos of him playing live at CBGB and a few interviews I watched. Yeah, and having [Dead Boys guitarist Cheetah Chrome] on set was quite a different thing. I had kind of a little bit of pressure because he was kind of watching every scene, and you\u2019re trying to portray him and do him justice, and it\u2019s quite a challenge.","So he was on set the whole time?","Grint: Yeah, he has a cameo. He plays the cab driver. He was lovely. He was such a nice guy. I was kind of surprised he was still alive.","Did he give you any notes while filming?","Grint: Not so much notes. It was just kind of watching him and being around him and listening to his stories and just listening, really, kind of absorbing a lot of that. And he was such a nice guy and we had a good time.","Was this movie your first instance of nudity on camera?","Grint: Yeah, I guess it was, yeah.","Were you comfortable with that? How did that go down?","Grint: Weirdly, yeah. It didn\u2019t really feel that big a deal. It just kind of happened. I didn\u2019t really think about it when I was getting ready for it, and yeah, it just kind of happened. I had some sort of sock, modesty thing, contraption. I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail. And yeah, it was just sort of one of those things. There was quite a lot of that in the film. Especially from Justin [Bartha] as well. ... There\u2019s quite a lot of ass in the film.","You had to try out an American accent in this role. Is there an accent out there that you'd be intimidated to have to use on camera?","Rickman: I think every English actor is nervous of a Newcastle accent. That\u2019s really difficult.","Grint: It\u2019s quite fun just trying to work on it and get it right. I like that kind of challenge. A couple years ago, I did a film that required me to do a Liverpool accent. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with that sound, but that was quite a hard one. It\u2019s quite a harsh sound. But I enjoy that side of things.","Once you started exploring the role and got into The Dead Boys and their history, did you find yourself enjoying their music? What did you think of the band you were portraying?","Grint: I really love them. I listened to all their songs completely. Their songs are quite hard to play, not easy to listen to. But no, I really love then. I\u2019ve always really wanted to be in a band, so this was kind of an opportunity to experience that. To go on stage and have the whole crowd there and the music.","Is music something you\u2019d ever pursue?","Grint: I don\u2019t know, probably not. I\u2019ve tried to leverage it, but I just know it\u2019s never going to happen.","Alan, you often play very dominant roles, very powerful people. What were your thoughts going into a character who was much more loose-goosey? Is it fun to shift gears and play that sort of character?","Rickman: I suppose, in my perspective, I\u2019ve played as many of those as I have the other sort. It\u2019s just some get more publicity or make more money at the box office or something. I\u2019m perfectly happy to be Colonel Brandon in \"Sense & Sensibility\" as I am any of those powerful characters. It\u2019s just part of an actor\u2019s job, and you just alter the colors that you get out of the cupboard.","How was it to reunite? Had you seen each other since doing press for the eighth \"Harry Potter\" movie?","Rickman: No, because I think we\u2019d both been so busy doing other things. But it was great to see him on the set, and it was great to watch all three of them. I saw Emma [Watson] the other night in London in a restaurant, and I saw Daniel [Radcliffe] recently in London because he was doing a play. It\u2019s great to watch the three of them moving forward into the rest of their lives and being working actors and not trapped by one image.","Grint: Not really, no, actually. ... I love Alan. He\u2019s always been one of my favorites. But yeah, it was quite weird seeing him in a whole new kind of environment because -- I\u2019m trying to think back -- I don\u2019t think I ever really saw him outside of that wig and cloak.","Which \"Potter\" co-star would you most like to reunite with?","Grint: There are so many. All of them. I\u2019ve already loved working with them. I like Michael Gambon. He\u2019s so cool; just a remarkable guy. I\u2019ve worked with Julie Walters before as well. I love her, she\u2019s great.","Now for something more fun. It's October. What's your favorite Halloween costume you've ever worn?","Rickman: [Laughs] The thing about Halloween is, to me, it just means -- because it\u2019s so different in England \u2013- we used to have something called Bonfire Night, and we\u2019d have fireworks. That\u2019s disappeared and I know Halloween\u2019s taken over. Halloween to me as a child was, the family would fill a bowl of water and you\u2019d have apple bobbing in it, and you\u2019d get apples out of a bowl of water. To me it just means a soaking wet shirt.","Grint: I liked Halloween. It never used to be a big thing when I was kid. We never really did it. But I actually had a good costume not that long ago. The last one, I dressed as a Play-Doh can that I made. You know Play-Doh?","Of course.","Grint: Well, literally, I actually made it. It was a yellow bin. I cut the bottom out and I just wore a yellow bin with a Play-Doh logo. With a yellow hat. It\u2019s not very practical.","Do you have a favorite Halloween candy?","Rickman: I don\u2019t even know what that means. The word \"chocolate\" would loom large.","Grint: A favorite Halloween candy? I don\u2019t really know. I never trick-or-treated when I was younger because we lived on a block of houses that were all just kind of elderly people who were just scared to answer the door. But yeah, candy corn, that\u2019s a big thing. I\u2019ve tried that. That\u2019s pretty great.","\"CBGB\" is out in limited release now."],"targetTitle":"Alan Rickman & Rupert Grint On 'CBGB,' Reuniting Post-'Potter' And Favorite Halloween Costumes","targetDescription":"The mythology of punk music's evolution can be traced back, more or less, to one singular staple: CBGB.

But what if there were a miracle elixir that could chase that hangover cloud away -- and better still, what if that magic drink were something you could easily pick up at your local supermarket?","A group of Chinese researchers say that they may have indeed found this perfect hangover cure -- and it goes by the name of \"Sprite.\"","After examining 57 beverages in a lab, researcher Hua-Bin Li and his colleagues at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou determined that Sprite was one of the drinks that best relieved hangover symptoms.","The team of scientists had hypothesized that what you consume after drinking booze could alter the effect of alcohol on your body. Specifically, they theorized that certain drinks could impact the body's metabolism of alcohol in a way that would help alleviate hangover symptoms.","Chemistry World explains it this way:","Some of the adverse effects of alcohol are thought to be caused, not by the ethanol itself, but by ethanol\u2019s first metabolite, acetaldehyde. Ethanol is metabolized into acetaldehyde by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and then into acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Unlike acetaldehyde, acetate is innocuous and may even be responsible for some of the positive health benefits of alcohol consumption. Therefore the key to reducing alcohol-related damage lies in minimizing the amount of time acetaldehyde is present in the body.","The Chinese researchers, therefore, decided that they would look at how the different beverages impacted the activity of ADH and ALDH.","Some beverages were found to be terrible for a hangover. An herbal infusion with hemp seeds, for example, was discovered to boost the activity of ADH while inhibiting ALDH, therefore slowing down the breakdown of acetaldehyde and dragging out the hangover effects.","On the other hand, some drinks, including Sprite (known in China as Xue bi) and a type of soda water, were found to have the opposite effect: increasing the activity of ALDH and thus speeding up the breakdown of acetaldehyde.","The researchers are reportedly planning to conduct the tests in living organisms, but the results have already generated a lot of buzz, as people around the world celebrate the possible death of the hangover. However, experts warn that we shouldn't quite raise the victory flag just yet.","Edzard Ernst, a medicinal science expert from the University of Exeter, told Chemistry World that while he found the study interesting, more research is necessary before we wholeheartedly embrace the results.","Do you have a tried-and-tested hangover cure that you swear by?

{"postId":"4l1vka","postText":["You won't believe this stunning \"Harry Potter\" revelation about Professor McGonagall"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["From reading J.K. Rowling\u2018s Harry Potter saga, and watching the films, we know a lot about one of our favorite professors and Head of Gryffindor house, Professor Minerva McGonagall. Stern but fair, McGonagall expected a lot from her students, but she also cared for them deeply, even if she didn\u2019t always outwardly express it. However, what if there was something about Professor McGonagall that we never thought about before? Reddit user Obversa made a stunning revelation about one of the most bad-ass witches in the entire HP saga.","Obversa suggests that \"Professor McGonagall was originally hired by Dumbledore to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts (DADA) in 1956. However, not long after, Tom Riddle (Lord Voldemort) came back to Hogwarts, seeking the DADA position for himself. Dumbledore denied Voldemort\u2019s application and as a result, Voldemort cast a jinx to prevent any DADA professor from \u2018lasting more than a year\u2019. Dumbledore then transferred McGonagall to the Transfiguration position before the term\u2019s end, to prevent anything \"bad\" or \"dangerous\" from happening to her. After all, as long as she wasn\u2019t teaching DADA , the jinx technically wouldn\u2019t apply to her.\" Obversa says, \"Prior to being Headmaster, Dumbledore served as Transfiguration professor for several decades, teaching Tom Riddle himself as a child. He was also McGonagall\u2019s predecessor, under Headmaster Armando Dippet. Thus, when Dumbledore succeeded Dippet, he would have left a vacancy for the spot of Transfiguration.\" We know that Minerva McGonagall filled this vacancy, but what led her there?","As a result of Pottermore, we know a bit more about Professor McGonagall\u2019s backstory (which is extremely similar to Lord Voldermort\u2019s background). McGonagall was appointed as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in 1956, not as his replacement. But why would Dumbledore hire a brilliant McGonagall just as his assistant and not to a full teaching position when she first arrived back at Hogwarts? If you recall, one of the reasons why Headmaster Dippet rejected Tom Riddle\u2019s application for the DADA teaching position, at age 17-18 for Tom, was because Tom was \"too young\". However, Dippet encouraged Tom \"to come back a few to several years later to apply again\". At the time, McGonagall was still perhaps too young, to be a Hogwarts professor in her own right.","Additionally, in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix McGonagall told Dolores Umbridge that she had been teaching at Hogwarts for \"Thirty-nine years this December\". Order of the Phoenix takes place in 1995 and 1996, with this statement coming in approximately September 1995. Therefore, McGonagall\u2019s official hiring would have been in the middle of the school year, very odd timing. But, why would McGonagall who is obviously gifted in Transfiguration initially apply to be the Defense Against the Dark Arts instructor?","Take note of Professor McGonagall\u2019s wand. It\u2019s made of Fir with a core of Dragon Heartstring. The Wandmaker Ollivander once called it the, \u2018the survivor\u2019s wand,\u2019 because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. This means that if the wand chooses the wizard, McGonagall would have been destined for a lot more than Transfiguration.","It seems likely then that McGonagall started teaching as Dumbledore\u2019s assistant in December of 1956, and, at some point, applied for (and received) the DADA job. However, Lord Voldemort arrived to Hogwarts shortly thereafter wanting to snag the position for himself. Once Dumbledore refused, Voldy put a hex on the position, so McGonagall had to be transferred to Transfiguration.

{"postId":"673910003032580096","postText":["J.J. Abrams has an answer on if there will be a post-credits scene in the new 'Star Wars'"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In the modern blockbuster world, post-credits scenes have become very popular. The films made by Marvel Studios are arguably best known for it, but fun stingers have also been found in the \"X-Men\" franchise movies as well as the latest \"Terminator.\" Because of this, some have wondered if this could be something new for the \"Star Wars\" series as well... but now J.J. Abrams has definitely put an end to that conversation.","The subject came up when Abrams was on stage for a \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" press conference held today in Los Angeles. The filmmaker was directly asked if fans can expect to see a post-credits scene or Easter Egg at the end of the sequel, and he quickly dismissed the idea, saying:","\"No, there\u2019s not. All the scenes are actually in the movie.\"","Those of you who have been following updates and stories about \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" for a while will note that this dispels a rumor that has been going around for the last few months. Back in September it was rumored that the latest saga film would actually be teasing the first \"Star Wars\" story, \"Rogue One.\" This made a degree of sense, given that the Gareth Edwards-directed feature has been filming since this past summer, and will surely have a good amount of footage ready by the time \"Force Awakens\" arrives in theaters. Now it sounds like that post-credits scene definitely isn\u2019t happening \u2013 so instead maybe we can just expect the blockbuster to come with a trailer for the eighth live-action \"Star Wars\" movie during the coming attractions.","Post-credits scenes are definitely fun for fans, and a good incentive to get people to stick around and watch the credits \u2013 but I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m too upset that \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" won\u2019t have one. After all, they aren\u2019t exactly part of the franchise\u2019s tradition (none of the previous movies have stingers), and it\u2019s not a device that has to be used all over Hollywood. If everything the movie has to say can be fit between the opening scrawl and the end credits, more power to it.","Surely there will be some fans who will be disappointed by this news, but hopefully they\u2019ll all get over it fairly quickly. After all, the feelings about the lack of a post-credits scene should be drowned out by the excitement that comes with the fact that we\u2019re now less than two weeks away from the theatrical release of \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" As always, stay tuned for more about the movie, including our on-camera interviews with the cast and J.J. Abrams!"],"targetTitle":"J.J.

Her mother is just now publicizing the story to help others avoid the same situation.","According to CJAD, Ducre-Lemay and her boyfriend had been out at a party earlier that night, which is why she didn't have her medication or her Medic Alert bracelet on her. After the kiss, she had trouble breathing, tried using her asthma pump, and, when that didn't work, asked her boyfriend about peanuts \u2014 when he said he'd eaten them, she told him to call 911.","He attempted to give her CPR before the ambulance arrived. Emergency crews attempted to resuscitate her with epinephrine, but failed. En route to the hospital, Ducre-Lemay suffered cardiopulmonary arrest, which led to cerebral anoxia (oxygen deprivation to the brain). She was taken off the respirator and died.","Head of Pediatric Allergy and Immunology at Montreal Children's Hospital Dr. Christine McCusker told CTV people between the ages 15 to 30 are in the \"risk age range\" and are most likely to suffer from severe allergic reactions. This is why people with allergies carry \"EpiPen[s], even though you don't want to and even though it's not cool,\" McCuskey said. \"People don't necessarily recognize it can go from that point where, 'I feel funny' to 'Uh oh' very fast.\"","According to FOX News, Ducre-Lemay had recently told people her allergies had decreased in severity, but McCusker said that is only true of every 1 in 5 allergy patients. Though many outlets report brushing your teeth helps eliminate the chance of an allergic reaction in this situation, the only thing that will ensure it won't happen is waiting a long time after you consume peanuts to kiss."],"targetTitle":"How This 20-Year-Old Died From Kissing Her Boyfriend","targetDescription":"He wasn't aware of her allergy.","targetKeywords":"Myriam Ducr\u00e9-Lemay,peanut allergy,peanut butter","targetMedia":["https:\/\/hips.hearstapps.com\/cos.h-cdn.co\/assets\/16\/23\/1600x800\/landscape-1465587291-myriam.jpg?resize=1200:*","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.cosmopolitan.com\/sex-love\/news\/a59749\/myriam-ducre-lemay-peanut-allergy-death\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"She had a peanut allergy and he had eaten a peanut butter sandwich. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle"},"spoiler":["he'd eaten a peanut butter sandwich and wasn't aware of her peanut allergy"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,67],[1,141]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":12}

Simpson murder case, Marcia Clark became a household name in the mid-'90s. Clark tells \"Oprah: Where Are They Now?\" what it felt like to return to normal life after the notorious murder trial.","\"In the beginning, I really missed it,\" Clark says about being a prosecutor. \"It's more than just a job, it's something that you live, eat and breathe -- to stand up for the victims, to stand up for justice.\"","The turning point, Clark says, came when she took up writing. Since leaving the courtroom, Clark has published three novels based on a fictional Los Angeles prosecutor named Rachel Knight. \"Writing novels and being in the courtroom \u2013 it's a storytelling job, no matter how you look at it,\" she says. \"It's the same thing.\"","While she hopes to one day be known as \"Marcia Clark, the author of the Rachel Knight mystery series\" and not \"Marcia Clark, the O.J. Simpson prosecutor,\" Clark knows the highly publicized trial led the public to form an opinion of her. \"I think people saw me on television and got the impression that I was very grim and very tough and very serious,\" she says. \"So when people met me in person, they\u2019d go, 'Wow, you're not at all like I thought you would be.'\"","\"I'm sure the experience of all the public scrutiny did change me,\" Clark says. \"I know that the experience taught me that I don't give up.\"","Also in the video, Clark reveals the question people ask her that she likes least: Does she think Simpson really did it? \"I wouldn't be in court if I didn't really think the person I'm prosecuting is guilty,\" she says. \"It's the beauty of the job, is that I don't have to go into court, when I'm a prosecutor, and fight to convict someone unless I believe 100 percent that person is guilty.\""],"targetTitle":"Former Prosecutor Marcia Clark On Life After The O.J.

{"postId":"4wagdb","postText":["What are mosquito-control workers spraying in Miami?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["(CNN) After the first locally transmitted cases of the Zika virus were identified in a small area north of downtown Miami, officials began to spray an insecticide over a 10-square-mile portion of Miami-Dade County. But what was in the insecticide, and how does it work?","The main ingredient of the insecticide, Dibrom, is the chemical naled. It works by killing mosquitoes on contact. Sprayers produce very fine droplets that are small enough to stay airborne and intercept mosquitoes in flight.","Naled does not pose a health risk to either people or pets when sprayed in low concentrations, according to both the Environmental Protection Agency (PDF) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","However, in its own review of naled, the European Union came to a different conclusion. Naled degrades to dichlorvos , a toxic chemical, in the presence of sunlight, and according to the EU scientific commission , this can cause genetic mutations. As a result, the EU has banned agricultural use of products containing naled.","In Puerto Rico, where a public health emergency has been declared due to the sheer number of cases of Zika, recommendations from the CDC and the EPA to use aerial spraying to control the mosquito population there have been stymied by protests. Activists organized a June 28 demonstration outside the San Juan CDC and raised concerns about the consequences for human health and their environment.","By contrast, in Miami-Dade County, the Department of Solid Waste Management's Mosquito Control Section commonly sprays in response to state Department of Health investigations -- and when residents request the use of insecticide.","The Mosquito Control Section has applied naled via an ultra-low-volume spray for many years, officials said in a news release. In fact, Dibrom has been used in the United States over the past 50 years, said Timothy J. Donnelly, vice president, chief administrative officer and general counsel of AMVAC Chemical Corp ., which makes the insecticide.","\"It is regularly sprayed in 12 states on over 15 million acres each year,\" Donnelly said.","Since the variety of mosquito that carries Zika is most active predawn and at sunset, all spraying must take place at those times. Special precautions are not necessary, Miami-Dade County officials advised, though people with allergies may want to remain indoors. During any insecticide operation, it is recommended that beekeepers cover their bees.","Aerial spraying, which lasts about an hour, was recommended by the CDC and Florida's Department of Health to reduce the population of adult mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading viruses, including Zika. Originally scheduled for Wednesday, the aerial spraying operation was delayed because of poor weather conditions.","\"When Naled gets sprayed, it knocks out the mosquitoes, but if sprayed over water, it breaks down quickly,\" said Bryn Phillips, a specialist in the University of California, Davis environmental toxicology department.","His research indicates that the insecticide breaks down into different chemical versions of Naled. One of these versions, dichlorvos, is quite toxic to aquatic species at the \"low end of the food chain,\" like aquatic insects and frog larvae -- \"basically fish food,\" Phillips said.","If the chemicals are rotated and managed properly, an environmental area can recover, Phillips noted.","Naled spray droplets stay airborne for an extended period, and the chemical begins to break down once exposed to sunlight or water. Very little of the low-concentration spray settles on the ground. Those who worry that they may have come into contact with the chemicals should wash, county officials advised; any food that may have been exposed should be rinsed before eating. Since concentrations are far below what is harmful to humans, symptoms, such as skin irritation or headache, are unlikely.","Miami-Dade County's aerial spraying alternates between naled and an insecticide called BTI (bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, a naturally occurring bacterium), which targets mosquito larvae instead of adult mosquitoes. BTI has been registered with the EPA since 1961 as a pesticide.","Zika was discovered in 1947 in Uganda. An outbreak that began in Brazil in 2015 has spread throughout the Americas. Florida reported the nation's first local transmission of Zika from an infected mosquito in late July.","Zika has been shown to be responsible for an alarming increase in microcephaly, in which babies are born with small brains and heads, as well as other hearing, vision and developmental disorders.","Although spraying insecticides raises concerns about toxicity to aquatic life, policy-makers must weigh the potential costs to human health by not spraying and costs to environmental health by spraying, Phillips said.","Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.","\"You talk to the mosquito spraying guys, and they're all about human health, and they're OK with some impacts to the environment,\" he said. Yet some environmentalists are not OK with any effects to land and sea, he said.","\"It's a balancing act,\" Phillips said."],"targetTitle":"What are mosquito-control workers spraying in Miami?","targetDescription":"Officials sprayed an insecticide containing naled over a 10-square-mile portion in Miami-Dade County.

{"postId":"1100188040002123_1123063127714614","postText":["Do birds fart?"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["Have you ever wondered, \"Do birds fart?\" No? Well maybe now we\u2019ve sparked your curiosity.","They don\u2019t fart\u2014detectably. There\u2019s no reason to believe that birds are somehow exempt from passing gas, but it doesn\u2019t seem like anyone has ever truly observed\u2014or more importantly, measured\u2014a bird fart. But between ornithologists, veterinarians, and amateur bird watchers, how is it possible no one has ever seen the feathered creatures flatulate?","As Monterey Bay Aquarium veterinarian Mike Murray said in a 2009 article for Popular Science, birds are capable of passing gas, but they don\u2019t because they lack the same combination of diet and gas-forming bacteria in their gut that gives mammals their odorous gas. Murray added that if he spotted gas in an x-ray of a bird\u2019s gastrointestinal tract, he\u2019d be concerned something was wrong with the bird.","But Laura Eriksen, a birder, educator, and blogger at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, has a different theory. In a blog post on her website, she posits that birds have much shorter digestive tracts than mammals, so there\u2019s less time for gas to build up, allowing farts to slip by undetected.","In another blog post, she describes the only written account she\u2019s aware of describing a possible bird fart. It comes from former Cornell student Alan Richard Weisbrod, in his 1965 master\u2019s thesis on blue jays.","One of the birds in front of me defecated. A small puff of whitish gas was expelled along with the feces. The feces dropped from the bird while the gas wafted below and parallel to the slightly raised tail, until it dissipated rapidly into the cold air. The gas could be clearly seen against the dark-colored eave that hangs over the sheltered perches, upon which the birds were fluffed and resting. Several days later a bird perched in the same position was observed to defecate with the accompanying wisp of whitish gas.","Weisbrod goes on to describe how birds eat similar diets to many mammals who definitely flatulate but explains that he could not find any other accounts of bird flatulence at that time. (And apparently no scientist has stepped up to the plate to follow up on Weisbrod\u2019s observation.) He also acknowledges that the \"wisp of whitish gas\" could also have simply been water vapor\u2014steam rising from the feces. (Just think of how your dog\u2019s poop steams in the cold when you take him out for his daily business in the winter.)","It\u2019s a little difficult to know for sure that birds rarely or never fart. According to Mental_Floss, human farts are smelly due to a combination of our diets and the microbes in our guts that help digest the foods in our diets. A video by AsapSCIENCE adds that \"the longer the food stays in the gut, the more time it has to ferment\" and break down into its smellier components\u2014namely sulfur. So if birds don\u2019t have the right food-microbe combo and intestinal length to produce smelly gas, then we wouldn\u2019t smell it.","Without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers.","But even if birds produced immaculate, odorless gas, would we hear it? That is less clear. According to a Q&A with proctologist Lester Gottesman in VICE, farts make a sound due to the composition of gas and the shape (read: tightness) of the sphincter. A lot of the gas that makes up a fart, Gottesman said, is swallowed air. And a lot of swallowed air leads to a lot of gas, which can make a bigger, beefier noise. But how much air does a swallow swallow when a swallow swallows air?","As far as we could tell, this isn\u2019t a question any scientist has specifically tried to measure. But the Daily Dot reached out to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology for answers nonetheless. According to an ornithologist there, relayed via email by the lab\u2019s good-humored press officer Miyoko Chu, birds definitely swallow air. But he thinks they expel it via burping rather than farting. He added that he thinks birds do fart \"in some cases and would depend on what species, their diet, and whether it is observable.\" He also said that he\u2019s never personally noticed a bird fart.","Lastly, maybe they do swallow enough air that would leave most animals saying \"excuse me\" after a butt-bellow, but perhaps something about the construction of the, erm, exit point keeps it from making a sound. This is pure speculation, but maybe something about having feathers around the bird\u2019s cloaca (its all-purpose back-end chute) helps the fart slip by unnoticed. And without a smell, bird farts rustle no one\u2019s feathers."],"targetTitle":"Do birds fart?","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/15c\/ce\/Screenshot202017-02-2620at2010.41.5720AM-500x250.png","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/themes\/dailydot\/img\/logo_black.png","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/themes\/dailydot\/img\/kernel-logo.png","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/themes\/dailydot\/img\/logo_white.png","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/69e\/73\/f7e3ca23be3c34b64675b7e636214a25.jpg","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/961\/ed\/13443e61fc64c27236ad91a76c23c7e2-500x250.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7","http:\/\/cdn.relaymedia.com\/ping?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailydot.com%2Fparsec%2Fdo-birds-fart%2F","https:\/\/19807-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/1ee\/4d\/167e61f4ead95121-500x250.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.dailydot.com\/geek\/do-birds-fart\/?fb=ss&prtnr=mentalfloss","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"No one is sure, but if they do it has no smell. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Science"},"spoiler":["They don\u2019t fart"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,0],[1,15]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":16}

That's why companies like Google and Microsoft let employees work from home or adjust their schedules to account for personal responsibilities, like taking a child to school in the morning.","But the study suggests a downside: Your boss may be unconsciously judging you for giving yourself a later start time, regardless of how much work you're getting done.","In the study, which will be published in full in the Journal of Applied Psychology later this year, researchers asked 149 supervisors to rate an employee\u2019s performance; employee start times ranged from 5 a.m. to 9:45 a.m. Even when employees who started later in the day worked the same number of hours as those who started earlier, supervisors were inclined to rate employees who began work earlier as more conscientious, and gave them higher performance ratings.","Bosses who preferred to work later hours themselves were less inclined to display this \"morning bias.\"","In a second experiment, the researchers assigned a group of 141 college students the role of a supervisor, and asked each student to review a profile of a fictitious employee. The performance of the fictional employee was the same in all cases, but start time varied across profiles. Researchers found that employees who worked from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. were consistently given higher ratings of conscientiousness and performance by the student supervisors than employees who worked from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.","The researchers concluded that employees who can opt for flexible work schedules should shift their schedules earlier, not later, to account for managers' morning bias.","\"It seems likely that some employees are experiencing a decrement in their performance ratings that is not based on anything having to do with their actual performance,\" the three researchers wrote in a post for the Harvard Business Review.","This \"morning bias\" appears to be deeply ingrained. In a word-association experiment designed to test the implicit stereotype that early risers are more diligent workers, the researchers also found that a majority of the 120 working adults surveyed linked words associated with the morning (like \"sunrise\") with words associated with conscientiousness (like \"industriousness\").","Another recent study covered by the New York Times further suggests there may be an implicit view among some managers that employees who take advantage of flexible work policies in any way are less conscientious than employees who work more \"traditional\" hours.","\"Most organizations still treat workplace flexibility as an accommodation,\" Erin Kelly, a sociology professor at the University of Minnesota, told the Times. \"You are implicitly saying, \u2018Most of us will be working these traditional ways and the rewards will come to those working these traditional ways.\u2019 And that is where you have this stigma or career penalties.\"","Although the study did not consider gender, it seems women could be more adversely affected by morning biases than men. That's because more women than men are primary caregivers for their children and assume a disproportionate amount of household tasks, according to a 2013 Bureau of Labor Statistics report. Studies have shown that women take advantage of workplace telecommuting policies more often than men for the same reason -- and that their careers may suffer as a result of not logging as much face time at the office."],"targetTitle":"The One Morning Work Mistake You Can't Recover From","targetDescription":"Rolling into the office around 9:30 a.m. every day may be killing your career, even if you stay late to put in a full day's worth of work. \r\n\r\nA","targetKeywords":"work-life balance,study,Harvard Business Review,what-is-working-small-businesses,Work hours,workplace,flexible work arrangements,work,flexible work schedules","targetMedia":["http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1790876\/images\/o-WOMAN-AT-WORK-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1790876\/images\/n-WOMAN-AT-WORK-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1lPBvP9","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Arriving later than your coworkers","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["starts later"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,269],[1,281]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":20}

After all, there are countless bottles stocking drugstore shelves. How much do you really know about them, though?","What Is Melatonin?","For starters, melatonin is a For starters, melatonin is a hormone released by the brain that helps regulate the body's circadian rhythm (aka your internal clock), explains David Lee, MD, an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program. \"It's secreted by the pineal gland, which is at the base of the brain, and regulated by light,\" he says. \"It's a natural hormone that makes us sleep, and the moment the light goes away, like in the evening, that's when our peak melatonin [is produced].\"","Are Melatonin Pills Really Safe?","Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of Since they aren't regulated by the US Food and Drug Administration, it might be hard to tell if there are preservatives and additives in the pills you're taking, says Sanjeev Kothare, MD, a professor in the department of neurology and director of the pediatric sleep program at NYU Langone Medical Center. \"Some [users] have experienced a little bit of allergic reactions , not from the melatonin, but from the preservatives or additives,\" he says. (Lee emphasizes that it's important to always buy the supplement from a reputable company, avoiding herbal remedy peddlers.)","Kothare says animal studies have linked melatonin to Kothare says animal studies have linked melatonin to depression , reproductive issues, and immunological problems. While these results haven't been replicated in humans, there also haven't been any good studies showing the long-term safety of melatonin pills, says Kothare.","Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a Still, Lee adds that no serious side effects have been reported. Though he does note that if you take too much of the supplement, you may feel drowsy, get a headache , or experience some short-term memory loss. \"Those are the common but pretty mild side effects,\" he says. The important thing, Lee points out, is to take the correct amount.","\"The biggest myth out there, especially for \"The biggest myth out there, especially for insomnia , is that more is better,\" says Lee. In fact, when it comes to melatonin, less is actually more because your body already makes it. He suggests taking 0.5 milligrams if you do decide to try it. If that dosage amount is difficult to track down, buy 1 milligram pills and cut them in half.","The bottom line: Unfortunately, there's not enough solid research out there on whether melatonin supplements are truly an effective and safe way to get to sleep. If you're still struggling to reach dreamland, Kothare has several other suggestions: Try to maintain a similar sleep schedule during the week and on weekends, limit the use of electronics that emit blue light for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime, and purchase a bright light source for use in the mornings to help regulate your body's internal clock.

On the surface it appears to be a minor update and its arrival was met with little ceremony. But beware, just hours after launch, it turns out iOS 9.3.2 is hiding a very nasty surprise indeed...","Apple iOS 9.3.2 is bricking iPad Pros.","\u2018Great Features\u2019 and \u2018Nasty Surprises\u2019 are my regular columns investigating operating system updates for the best features \/ biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.","News of this first appeared on the popular MacRumors forums (something the site has followed up) before gathering momentum on Twitter where many users posted angry tweets demanding help from the official @AppleSupport account.","So what is going on? A clear pattern is emerging:","When affected devices install iOS 9.3.2 and restart users are presented with an \u2018Error 56\u2019 code which tells them to connect to iTunes. The problem is connecting to iTunes does nothing, the device is locked and forced reboots only return it the same state.","As for the error code itself, according to Apple\u2019s code guide, Error 56 is loosely described as a \"hardware issue\", which doesn\u2019t sound like a credible explanation.","Interestingly, from my initial investigations, it seems the newer iPad Pro 9.7 is affected far more often than the iPad Pro 12.7 (the two models have key feature differences). But the good news is there are reports of iPad Pro 9.7 models updating without problems and iPhones and other iPad models appear to be getting through unscathed.","So what happens now? I suspect Apple will make a statement about this sooner rather than later (I\u2019ve contacted the press team), and the two obvious paths are to a) Re-release a tweaked version of iOS 9.3.2 or b) quickly issue a new update (iOS 9.3.3?) as an emergency fix.","All of which does little to aid the reputation of iOS 9 which has suffered numerous high profile problems, despite originally being a fine tuning of iOS 8 rather than offer a radical overhaul.","Needless to say I\u2019d advise everyone (regardless of whether they own an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch) to steer clear of iOS 9.3.2 until more is known.","___","More On Forbes","Apple Leak Reveals 'Edgeless Display' New iPhone","iPhone 7 Leak Reveals Significant Feature Removed","iPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?","iPhone SE Vs iPhone 6S Review: Which You Should Buy?","Apple Confirms iOS 9.3 Causes iPad, iPhone Problems"],"targetTitle":"Apple iOS 9.3.2 Has A Nasty Surprise","targetDescription":"Apple's new iOS update should be avoided for now...","targetKeywords":"Mobile,Tech","targetMedia":["http:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/05\/IMG_0444-1200x900.jpg?width=960","http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&d=mm&r=g","http:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/05\/2016-05-16_21-07-54.jpg?width=960","http:\/\/specials-images.forbesimg.com\/imageserve\/56ecd8bae4b0c144a7f7a011\/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","https:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/05\/IMG_0444-1200x900.jpg?width=640&height=434"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/gordonkelly\/2016\/05\/16\/apple-ios-9-3-2-ipad-pro-problems\/#a360bea5db73","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"It bricks iPad Pros. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle"},"spoiler":["bricking iPad Pros"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,19],[1,37]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":24}

{"postId":"814183134535315456","postText":["How distance brought an end to an NBA power couple that withstood conflicts of interest and professional trials:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Phil Jackson wasn't in the mood to stop and catch up. His New York Knicks had gotten out of Staples Center with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers and he'd gone an entire game without having to wave to nostalgic Lakers fans on the big screen.","\"I think the Lakers are trying to move away from that kind of stuff,\" Jackson said as we spoke briefly outside the Knicks' locker room on Dec. 11.","There was such a distance in the way he said, \"The Lakers.\" This, after all, is the man who won five NBA titles in Los Angeles and was still engaged to Lakers president Jeanie Buss. But that distance was real, and it had kept growing as the years went by and Jackson spent more and more time in New York, running the Knicks, and in Montana with his children and grandchildren during the offseason.","His connection with Los Angeles, and his fiance\u0301e, was simply too hard to maintain. On Tuesday night, Buss and Jackson announced that they were mutually ending their four-year engagement.","The announcement -- via their personal Twitter accounts -- brought an end to the NBA's version of Camelot.","Like the Camelot in Richard Burton's Broadway musical, this had always been an impossible romance.","The owner's daughter dating the team's coach? And not just any owner: only one of the most powerful owners of all time, Lakers owner Dr. Jerry Buss. And not just any coach: only the most successful NBA coach of all time.","Then there were hurdles, such as Jeanie Buss being the team's vice president in charge of business affairs at the time, and her brother Jim Buss being in charge of basketball operations.","So many tangled webs, and yet Jeanie Buss and Jackson somehow made it work for 17 years.","During the best of times, when the Lakers were winning NBA championships, they'd ride to the arena together from their house in Marina Del Rey. At games, Jeanie would sit with her girlfriends Linda Rambis and Stacy Kennedy in the second row, across the court from the Lakers bench, where Phil could see her and the players could hear her.","Once on the drive in, Jackson mentioned Lamar Odom needed a little extra encouragement as he adjusted to his new role as a sixth man. So during the game, Buss and her girlfriends made a point of cheering for Odom as he checked into the game. \"Take your pants off!\" they yelled out, as Odom shed his warm-ups near the scorers' table. He beamed at the attention.","It was a small thing, but it was those kind of gestures that made the impossible relationship work for so many years. The way they'd work in tandem and share thoughts about the team with each other. That was Camelot.","Once Jackson retired as coach in 2011, things started changing. At first he was home all the time, plotting his next moves. He had no intention of coaching again -- his body couldn't take it. And his spirit was leading him in other directions, toward a front-office career, which would allow him to test his principles from on high, way above the court.","But when Dr. Buss was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012, and the franchise needed a coach of some stature to come in and lead the team of superstars -- Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, Dwight Howard and Steve Nash -- for what appeared to be Dr. Buss' last ride, Jackson raised his hand.","As always, he would do it for Jeanie.","This time, the Lakers didn't call on him. Or rather, general manager Mitch Kupchak called him around midnight to tell him the Lakers had chosen to hire Mike D'Antoni instead.","Jackson was livid. His agents issued a blistering statement, decrying the disrespect shown to the coach who had won five titles for L.A. and was willing to come out of retirement to coach the team and help his fiancee's family at a critical juncture.","It did not break apart their relationship though. If anything, it strengthened it. About six weeks later, Jackson proposed to Jeanie Buss. His knees and hips were too stiff to get down on one knee. Not that he is the grand gesture type, anyway. What was important is that he knew getting engaged would make her happy, and give her father some peace as he lay dying.","The engagement was almost destined to stay at that level once Jackson became president of the Knicks in 2014. Jackson and Buss had to sign documents that ensured there would be no conflicts of interest between the two franchises. According to sources, that included a provision that the NBA and its owners be informed if they ever decided to marry.","So now not only were they living apart, they couldn't talk about their jobs when they were together. If they ever did decide to marry, it would further complicate their business relationships.","As the years went by, Jackson focused in on the Knicks and Buss focused on the Lakers. He would come to Los Angeles when he could, and she would see him in New York when she attended board of governors meetings, but friends say it got harder and harder to find time to connect.","Both of their legacies are tied to what they do next. Buss must decide whether to reboot the Lakers' front office. Jackson needs to make the Knicks into a contender. Those close to Jackson say he intends to stay for the full five years of his contract with the Knicks, despite the mutual option that's built into his contract this summer.","There had been speculation that Jackson could return to the Lakers this offseason, when they might need a new guide in the front office, and he could amicably part from New York. Those are the types of implausible things that happen in Camelot.","It was never meant to be.","Buss has been spending the past year supervising the development of the team's new practice facility, and working tirelessly on the league's new collective bargaining agreement. She also has maintained close ties with first-year coach Luke Walton, which is a departure from her distant relationships with previous Lakers coaches. Those close to Buss say she also has been giving more thought to the looming question of the team's front office.","All of those are massive things, that Jackson and Buss simply couldn't talk about given their current roles.","So the impossible relationship officially came to a loving end Tuesday night. Camelot was over."],"targetTitle":"Phil and Jeanie -- basketball's ultimate power couple -- call it quits","targetDescription":"Despite so many tangled webs, Phil Jackson and Jeanie Buss made it work for 17 years.

{"postId":"572751807417618432","postText":["Rebekah Brooks is back with Rupert Murdoch, and this time it's digital"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["\"This one.\"","Those were the words of Rupert Murdoch when asked about his top priority following the 2011 fall of News of the World in a phone hacking scandal.","He was referring to Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, a subsidiary of Murdoch's News Corp. At the time, Brooks had just been cleared of all charges stemming from the hacking fiasco that ended with more than 100 arrests and the closure of News of the World, which she oversaw.","While Brooks emerged from the scandal without formal punishment, she had resigned from News International and spent several months on the front pages of newspapers around the globe. Her reputation in tatters, it was widely believed that her image and reputation had become too toxic to ever again hold a high position at News Corp.","That speculation appears to have underestimated Murdoch's affinity for Brooks. Just eight months after being cleared of charges, Brooks is set to return to News Corp in a role focusing on digital media.","Upward mobility","Brooks enjoyed a meteoric rise through the ranks of News Corp's tabloids to become one of the youngest top editors in Britain at the age of 32.","Known as a sharp and aggressive journalist, Brooks was not afraid to test the limits of ethics when reporting stories. She once famously rigged a hotel room with recording devices when meeting a source who claimed to have had a sexual relationship with Princess Diana.","Another time, she dressed as a cleaning lady and hid in a bathroom stall in order to get an early copy of another London paper \u2014 The Sunday Times \u2014 and then stole one of the paper's scoops.","Brooks's hard charging ways led her to some of the highest positions at Murdoch's tabloids. In 2000, she was named editor of News of the World. In 2003, she became the first female editor of The Sun. In June 2009, she took the role of chief executive as News International, a subsidiary of News Corp that operates numerous papers including The Sun and News of the World.","Having risen to the top of Britain's media elite, Brooks maintained friendships with many of the country's most influential figures, including former Prime Minister Tony Blair, current Prime Minister David Cameron and Cameron's communications director Andy Coulson, who also edited News of the World and served jail time in the coming scandal.","A fall from the top, but not from grace","Brooks had been under official scrutiny for her actions since 2003, but it was not until a 2009 story from The Guardian that her actions began to catch up with her.","By January 2011, London law enforcement had launched a new investigation into allegations of phone hacking while Brooks led News of the World. Among the allegations was evidence that the voicemail of a murdered schoolgirl had been illegally accessed, which gave her family false hope that she was still alive.","The inquiries dragged on for years, with Brooks eventually found not guilty of all charges.","Brooks avoided jail time, but the damage had been done. The former editor had become the face of the out-of-contol excesses of London's tabloid media.","Peter Jukes, a journalist who closely followed the hacking trial, noted that Brooks' reputation has not recovered despite her acquittal on all charges.","\"I can say that having toured around the UK talking about the trial ... the overwhelming question isn't, 'Why was Rebekah put on trial,' but 'Why was she found not guilty?'\" Jukes said.","But it was Brooks' bond with Murdoch that served her even after ending up as the type of tabloid fodder that she had once fed on. As the chairman and CEO of News Corp, Murdoch has been one of the most powerful global media figures for decades. His affinity for her had been the source of no shortage of reporting in the UK, with some saying that she was like a daughter to him.","An odd fit","Even if some people believed that Brooks would eventually return to a role at News Corp, few expected her to land at Storyful. But reports on Sunday said she would work with or oversee the subsidiary, which provides social media content to major newsrooms around the world.","Storyful launched in 2010 with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Founded by journalist Mark Little, the company sought to tap the emergence of citizen journalism on social media, particularly the posting of pictures and video. The company worked to find and verify this kind of content. This aggregated media would then be provided to its media partners.","The startup was quickly seen as being on the cutting edge of digital journalism, particularly the use of social media and crowdsourcing to provide almost real-time coverage of breaking news. The company accrued an impressive list of clients, including the BBC, ABC and The New York Times, which use content found and vetted by Storyful. (Mashable is also a Storyful client.)","News Corp bought Storyful in December 2013 for $25 million, pledging that the startup would operate as a standalone company.","Storyful had been built in part on a promise of veracity and accountability in a space that had been lacking credibility.","Now, with Brooks entering the fold, that promise has begun to ring hollow.","I feel so sorry for the people I know at @Storyful if this is true. http:\/\/t.co\/eUpjZu5hVw They deserve better. \u2014 Jay Rosen (@jayrosen_nyu) March 2, 2015","Wait, what?

That is, until now.","Beginning earlier this month and continuing through June 15, the macabre creations of the late Gorey are front and center for two concurrent exhibitions at the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) in Chicago.","One of the shows, \"Elegant Enigmas: The Art of Edward Gorey,\" is a touring exhibition organized by the Brandywine Museum in Chadds Ford, Penn. that offers a comprehensive look at his illustrations as well as work by other artists he influenced.","The second exhibition, \"G is for Gorey, C is for Chicago,\" pulls from the collection of Loyola alumnus Thomas Michalak, a member of the board of directors of the Edward Gorey House in Massachusetts who has collected Gorey material for over two decades. It includes a number of rare items offering a deeper look at the mysterious man behind the art, including some of his report cards, early drawings and book covers he designed, and the ornately decorated envelopes of letters he sent to his mother, Helen.","Pam Ambrose, director of LUMA, told HuffPost the shows aim to address the lack of awareness of Gorey's Chicago roots in addition to tracing the man's development from a budding artist to an acclaimed cultural icon who inspired creators like Daniel Handler and Tim Burton. His influence is also felt in \"Summerland: A Ghost Story,\" a small mixed-media installation by Chicago artist Kenneth Gerleve that's also also included in the show.","\"I want people to really think about who this man was,\" Ambrose said,\" because he appears to be many contradictions in one persona. But was this a persona invented to keep people away? It's very hard to say. He seems like someone who shapeshifts a bit.\"","The LUMA shows have been a hit -- they had people lined up outside the front door on opening day, \"pretty good\" for a university museum, Ambrose noted. Tickets to a Saturday bash celebrating what would have been Gorey's 89th birthday sold quickly.","While Gorey will forever be linked to gothic subculture thanks in large part to his signature Victorian characters dressed in head-to-toe black, the show paints a broader portrait of the artist than that. For example, prominently-placed illustrations of cats throughout the show acknowledge his fascination with felines, and many of his kid-centric illustrations feel downright giddy when compared to his familiar somber style.","\"This is an artist who was much more important than the immediate perception of just the gothic tale or cautionary tale,\" Ambrose said."],"targetTitle":"Edward Gorey Returns To Hometown With New Chicago Exhibition","targetDescription":"Despite the fact that renowned author and illustrator Edward Gorey was born in Chicago and spent a sizable chunk of his formative years in the Windy City...","targetKeywords":"Edward Gorey loyola exhibition,Edward Gorey chicago shows,Edward Gorey loyola show,Chicago travel,Edward Gorey art,Edward Gorey,Edward Gorey chicago,chicago around town,Edward Gorey chicago exhibition","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464886_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464890_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464888_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464892_free.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464889_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3465149_free.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1642144\/thumbs\/o-GOREY-570.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464887_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1641833\/images\/n-GOREY-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464884_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1641833\/images\/o-GOREY-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464883_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1642139\/thumbs\/o-GOREY-570.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1642148\/thumbs\/o-GOREY-570.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/338383\/slide_338383_3464885_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1fGZWOe","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Edward Gorey","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["Edward Gorey"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,54],[0,66]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":31}

CREATE YOUR OWN CLEANER","'A nifty cleaning cheat for treating stubborn stains is to use a homemade oven cleaner,' advises Rik Hellewell, founder and MD at oven valeting service Ovenu, who put together the tips.","'This helps save you time and money. A simple mixture of white vinegar and baking soda works wonders to help remove grease and grime.","'The vinegar will react with the baking soda to foam gently.","'Rub the paste onto the area you need to treat and leave it for 30 minutes to get to work. Then once the time\u2019s up, you should be able to wipe the dirt away easily.'","2. CLEAN SHELVES IN 30 MINUTES","'When was the last time you removed the shelves from your oven?' asks Rik.","'Probably not that recently. However, in order to cook your food in a hygienic environment, you need to ensure that you keep them sparkling clean.","'A quick way to restore your shelves to their former glory is to place the shelves in a resealable plastic bag, spray with oven cleaner, seal the bag, then leave to soak. Make sure you read the instructions on the cleaning product and wear protective clothing where necessary.","'After 30 minutes, remove the shelving from the resealable bag. Rinse them under warm water and use a scourer to scrub away any remaining burnt-on food.'","3. USE AN OLD TOOTHBRUSH","'An old toothbrush is an essential oven-cleaning tool. Its soft bristles and flexible head allow you to clean areas that would otherwise be out of reach.","'Even better, if you use an electric toothbrush, the vibration will help to loosen any burnt-on food.","4. USE A GLASS SCRAPER","'A glass scraper is ideal for removing tough stains from the door and floor of your oven.","'If the door is removable, unscrew it and soak in oven cleaner and warm water, then scrape the stuck-on food residue away.'","5. REMOVE OIL WITH OIL","'It may sound strange, but you can remove greasy build-up on the hood of your oven with oil.","'In fact, this technique will make clean-ups in the future really easy. Place a couple of drops of vegetable oil onto a paper towel and rub it over the greasy area.","'The oil helps to remove the grease without the use of any harsh chemicals. Once clean, spray the areas with all-purpose oven cleaner to ensure that no oil remains.'","6. BANISH BAD SMELLS EASILY","'We\u2019ve all cooked a wonderful meal only to have the smell linger for days.","'If you\u2019ve cooked something especially pungent, like fish, a few drops of vanilla or citrus essence can work wonders.","'Simply add a few drops in an ovenproof bowl filled with water. Slowly heat the bowl for an hour and you\u2019ll soon rid your kitchen of those pongs.","7. USE CAR WAX FOR GREASE","'A dirty hob is a sure sign of a dirty oven. A thin layer of car wax on your hob can help remove built-up grease. Simply apply and wipe away.","'If any dirt remains, don\u2019t worry. To get a ceramic hob clean, sprinkle with baking soda and a few drops of water. Then wipe clean with a soft cloth. If your oven has steel burners then place them in a resealable bag overnight with a drop of bleach and warm water. The next day, wipe the burners down and wash in warm, soapy water.'","8. POLISH WITH CREAM OF TARTAR","'Cream of tartar may seem like an odd cleaning product to use on your oven, but it is extremely effective at keeping stainless steel shiny.","'Simply apply with a thin cloth, leave for 10 minutes, then wipe away.'","9. REMOVE STUCK ON FOOD WITH DISHWASHER TABLETS","'Dishwasher tablets are excellent at removing stuck-on food from your pots and pans in a dishwasher, so why should your oven be any different?","'Take a dishwasher tablet and dip half of it in warm water. Next rub the tablet over the built-up grease on your oven door and watch the burnt-on dirt wash away with minimal effort.'","10. HOW TO NEVER SCRUB AGAIN","'There\u2019s a very quick and easy way to battle grease and grime.","'Make sure that your oven is completely cool and then spray oven cleaner into the corners. Leave overnight if you can; if not, leave for at least four hours.","'After the product has worked its magic, you should be able to simply wipe the grime away. If any burnt-on food remains, cover with your homemade cleaning solution of white vinegar and baking soda.'

David Jolly introduced his quixotic plan to ban members of Congress from soliciting campaign contributions, the Florida Republican had only six co-sponsors.","Then, three weeks ago, \"60 Minutes\" did a sympathetic piece on Jolly\u2019s idea, giving national attention to the scandal of lawmakers spending 30 or more hours a week dialing for dollars.","And now? The number of co-sponsors on Jolly\u2019s bill has jumped from six all the way up to \u2014 um, eight. No senator has come forward with similar legislation.","Jolly, appearing Monday morning at the National Press Club with his lead Democratic co-sponsor, Rep. Rick Nolan (Minn.), was not surprised. \"We\u2019ve got six more co-sponsors than I thought we might have,\" he said. It\u2019s \"a heartbreaking reflection on what the priorities of the Congress are. . . . A member\u2019s political survival depends on raising money \u2014 that\u2019s the reality.\"","Jolly speaks the truth. Lawmakers know what needs to be done to clean up the corrupt system \u2014 but nothing happens.","Democrats talk about overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics. But that ultimate fix isn\u2019t happening soon. In the House, Rep. John Sarbanes (D-Md.) has recruited 160 co-sponsors for his system of public financing of elections \u2014 another good idea \u2014 but so far he has only one Republican, gadfly Walter Jones (N.C.). Republicans remain reflexively opposed to reform, including the idea of disclosure, which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once championed.","This is why Jolly\u2019s idea deserves a look. He calls it congressional reform, not campaign-finance reform. The goal: to get lawmakers to spend more time lawmaking. \"We\u2019re here three days a week, and half your time is spent raising money,\" he said. \"In the face of growing crises around the globe, you\u2019ve got a part-time Congress.\" This, he said, \"is a first-rate scandal.\"","I\u2019ve argued for other ways to get lawmakers to spend more time working \u2014 returning to the five-day week, cutting travel allowances, ending the corrosive practice of members targeting each other for defeat through party committees. Jolly, now a Senate candidate in Florida, offers another tack.","The Republican Party is predictably opposed. The National Republican Congressional Committee, in a letter to CBS after the \"60 Minutes\" segment, accused Jolly of peddling \"fiction\" when he said party officials told him he had to raise $18,000 a day.","Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote Unfortunately, liberals have piled on. Campaign-finance reformer Fred Wertheimer told me the idea \"is not going to solve the problem,\" because those working for the members could still solicit funds. Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, wrote a piece in the Orlando Sentinel calling Jolly\u2019s bill a \"cynical example of fraudulent reform\" because \"all that would change is that congressmen wouldn\u2019t have to do the dirty work.\"","But while Jolly can be accused of election-year gimmickry, he voluntarily refused to solicit contributions for his Senate run. And though the bill wouldn\u2019t by itself solve the campaign-finance mess, it could help to improve the woeful political culture in other ways.","Jolly\u2019s Democratic sidekick, Nolan, said that when he first served in Congress in the 1970s, lawmakers worked full weeks, giving them time to develop respect for one another and to find common ground.","\"If you\u2019ve already consumed 40, 50 hours of the week in travel and fundraising, there\u2019s not a lot of time left over for governing, and we\u2019re seeing the results of that,\" he said. \"We\u2019re looking at the last couple of sessions of the Congress of the United States as being the most unproductive in the history of the country. Why? Well, if everybody\u2019s busy campaigning and raising money, there\u2019s no time for governing.\"","The little support Jolly has gained for the idea comes largely from Florida, home to three of his eight co-sponsors, including Democrat Alan Grayson, also a Senate candidate. A Democratic congressional candidate in Florida, businessman Randy Perkins, went one step further, announcing he would stop \"soliciting or accepting\" financial contributions.","But Jolly, a former lobbyist and longtime staffer to the late congressman C.W. Bill Young, continues to agitate. He said he\u2019s not paying his $400,000 in dues to the NRCC, and he said \"I don\u2019t buy the notion\" that he needs more sponsors before House leadership grants a hearing on his bill.","Jolly is a potential ally of Democrats on campaign-finance reform, saying that Citizens United \"could be revisited\" and that \"we can do better.\" Until then, surely more lawmakers on both sides can see the virtue of his cause. \"You think you get elected to represent 700,000 people,\" he said. \"But you actually got elected to be one more marble on our side of the aisle to keep the majority, and to do that you\u2019ve got to go raise $2 million \u2014 and that makes members angry.\"","Or at least it should."],"targetTitle":"Lawmakers could do this to fight corruption.

What\u2019s more, then and there, despite having no experience of rearing animals, he vowed to nurse the poor baby back to health.","This took place in 2013 on the sizzling streets of Tampa. Longo, a Florida native, thought that the little thing didn\u2019t look good, and he knew that the unrelenting sunshine was taking its toll.","Indeed, Longo later recounted how the helpless baby was \"half-dead\" when they first met. And so, despite having no clue even as to what the animal was, he decided to take it back to his home in St. Petersburg.","Consequently, Longo christened the critter Biscuits and began to hand-rear her himself. Clearly, then, the first order of the day was to give the adorable and tiny creature, which was just over an inch in length, some major TLC.","However, without an inkling of even which species Biscuits belonged to, Longo didn\u2019t have the first idea about how best to raise her. So, this being the 21st century and all, he began to research his new-found friend online.","First, Longo went to Reddit to ask the website\u2019s online community for help. However, most of the responses were from people telling him, simply, that there was no way he\u2019d manage to raise Biscuits on his own. Undeterred, though, Longo continued his research and eventually discovered the answer he was looking for.","It turned out that he was going to be looking after a southern flying squirrel. Naturally, this species of squirrel usually resides in forests and woods, using trees as their habitat. They furthermore survive on a diet of nuts, seeds, fruit and insects as well as eggs and birds.","The gliding rodents are nocturnal, and young squirrels tend to stay with their mothers until they are at least two months old. Since Biscuits had somehow become separated from her family, then, it was now down to Longo to fill her mother\u2019s shoes.","So, for two months, Longo took Biscuits everywhere with him \u2013 even to work. He even bottle-fed her with a mix of puppy formula and heavy cream.","As each day passed, Biscuits grew bigger and stronger, until she eventually became a healthy adult squirrel. In addition to getting the gift of life, though, Biscuits had also, again thanks to her encounter with Longo, gained a new family.","Indeed, alongside her surrogate mother, Biscuits gained some four-legged family friends \u2013 in the shape of Longo\u2019s dogs. That said, given their difference in stature, Longo admitted that he had to \"watch them so they don\u2019t accidentally squish her.\""],"targetTitle":"He Rescued This Bizarre Creature From a Sidewalk, But He Had No Idea What It Would Grow Into","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-DVbaM9KZcd3wx.gif","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/themes\/semplicemente-scribol-dartfish\/images\/logo.png","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/Lead-3.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/rescued-basil-fox-lead-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/lead-Strangest-Secret-Service-Codenames-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=22315478&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/2-5.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/3-6.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Stupid-Animals-Lead-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Plague-pit-in-london-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/man-thinking-on-the-street-240x120.jpeg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Anja-Ringgren-Loven-hope-lead_2-300x150.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Maryanne-and-Tommy-300x150.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/rescued-basil-fox-lead-300x150.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1078785378906679&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Plague-pit-in-london-300x150.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/lead-Reasons-Why-You-Shouldnt-Give-Up-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Meghan-Markle-at-The-Hunger-Games-Catching-Fire-London-premiere-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Maryanne-and-Tommy-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/00-Brooklyn-Beckham-and-Emily-McEnroe-then-240x120.jpg","https:\/\/d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net\/atrk.gif?account=KpNrm1akKd60Cs","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/boy-hospital-transplant-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/97a7f7ba083974c8f4fc6215a041dcc6?s=96&d=mm&r=g","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Anja-Ringgren-Loven-hope-lead_2-240x120.jpg","http:\/\/15858-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/Jennifer-and-Kourtney-Woracek-240x120.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/scribol.com\/environment\/man-found-bizarre-creature-tampa-southern-flying-squirrel\/?utm_source=hexagram_Facebook3933&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=man-found-bizarre-creature-tampa-southern-flying-squirrel","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"A Flying Squirrel","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["southern flying squirrel"],"spoilerPositions":[[[6,54],[6,78]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":36}

This new study helps me understand why."],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["I was a horrible lacrosse player in high school: bad at catching the ball, slow, and not very aggressive.","Yet I'd spend hours at a handball wall with my stick: throwing, catching, repeating. I played on winter leagues, and woke up early for 6 am pickup games. Freshman and sophomore years, I made it onto the junior varsity team \u2014 a miracle.","By 11th grade, it was time to try out for varsity lacrosse. This is when my history teacher \u2014 the varsity coach \u2014 pulled me aside and suggested I shouldn't bother. I'd probably be cut, he said (adding that I was getting very good grades).","For me, practice did not make perfect. Lo and behold, I now have scientific validation.","A meta-analysis in Perspectives in Psychological Science looked at 33 studies on the relationship between deliberate practice and athletic achievement and found that practice just doesn't matter that much.","More precisely, the analysis found, practice can account for 18 percent of the difference in athletic success. Put another way, if we compare batting averages between two baseball players, the amount of time the players spent in the batting cage would only account for 18 percent of the reason one player's average is better than the other.","Even more simply: Some people are just better at sports than others, and the difference cannot be made up by practice alone. There was a reason I lagged behind my peers on the lacrosse field. They probably had a natural advantage on me.","\"One important thing \u2014 that's easy to misunderstand\u2014 is that this is looking at variance across people, not within an individual,\" Brooke Macnamara, the lead author of the Perspectives paper, tells me. \"So if a person practices, they will get better. Almost across the board, practice should improve one\u2019s performance.\"","But it also means that for the same amount of practice, some will end up being better at sports than others. \"Essentially, learning rates vary,\" Macnamara says. \"Some people improve very quickly with less practice, while others require much more practice.\"","The analysis found this 18 percent figure is roughly true no matter what type of sport is being played. Practice accounts for the same difference in performance in bowling as it does field hockey, two completely different activities.","Practice also explains fewer differences in ability the further an athlete ascends into higher levels of play. Which suggests \"deliberate practice loses its predictive power beyond a certain level of skill,\" the study reports. The analysis also found that the age when athletes started their sports didn't change this figure much either.","So what, then, explains the remaining 82 percent?","Here's where we should note a limitation of studying practice: Researchers typically ask athletes to recall their schedules and practice hours, and memories can be faulty.","But Macnamara doesn't think better measurements of practice would make that 18 percent figure leap up to near 100.","\"There\u2019s probably not one huge contributor that\u2019s accounting for everything else,\" she says.","Instead, there's likely a whole constellation of factors \u2014 some of which are genetic or biological in nature \u2014 that explain why some people are better athletes than others. They include:","Personality and perseverance","Propensity to get injured","Propensity to choke under pressure","Individual differences in maximum oxygen uptake","Differences in how we acquire muscle mass","Coordination","Height","Enjoyment of competition","\"We have so many factors within a person that can contribute to [athletic performance] \u2014 different genes, different cognitive abilities, different physical attributes,\" she says. \"All of those things are important and interact with each other. Which is why it is so hard to pin down what predicts performance.\"","Overall, she says the finding is a strike against the popular \"10,000 hour rule,\" which implies anyone can become master at an activity if they were to just devote the time to it. The research in sports, and in other activities such as music, games, and education, just doesn't back that hypothesis up.","On the other hand, it's not like these findings are an excuse not to try.","\"Eighteen percent is big,\" Macnamara says. \"We're trying to argue against these ideas that it's so important it accounts for nearly everything.\" Practice matters, but it's unlikely to bridge the gap between inborn superstars and your average, or perhaps clumsy, kid.","For the athletically un-inclined, like myself, it's a bit of a relief. It's okay if you can't make up the difference with practice, or if you're just a \"slow learner\" when it comes to sports. It's also okay to just enjoy being on a team, trying hard but knowing you'll unlikely be the best.","Growing up, my dad was on a quest to find \"my sport\" \u2014 the activity I'd finally master. Lacrosse was the closest we came. But it was mostly a parade of failures. Baseball: Throw a ball at me and I'll be more likely to bruise than catch it. Soccer: I was much too slow. Basketball: All of the above. Tennis: I was cut from the middle school team.","I'm not a well-coordinated person, and that's just fine.","These days I stick to activities that don't involve hand-eye coordination: hiking, biking, running, skiing. I love physical activity. Life's just too short to spend it on activities you're horrible at."],"targetTitle":"I was really bad at sports in high school.

One memorable shot showed off the singer's protruding package in arresting profile. Shortly after the photos hit the Internet, a web site called Breathe Heavy posted what it claimed was the same image prior to re-touching. If that claim were accurate, it would mean that Calvin Klein (well, not him personally, although maybe) had stuffed Bieber's stocking nearly to bursting. Here are the two images side-by-side:","Bieber's team immediately insisted that Breathe Heavy's photo was fake, and requested the web site take it down. Breathe Heavy complied, originally replacing the photos with an editor's note, but eventually removing the entire post altogether. In that since-deleted note, Breathe Heavy's editor seems to accept Bieber's explanation at gunpoint.","Bieber denies the photo is real, and I respect that and will believe him.","The question, therefore, is: Are the claims of the Bieber camp correct, and the photo fake?","Or did Breathe Heavy have the real photo, and capitulate in the face of legal intimidation?","(It's easy to make a case that Breathe Heavy's photos are the real deal: We know that at least one photo was significantly retouched prior to publication, as Bieber's camp did not dispute an earlier TMZ story alleging that Calvin Klein sculpted Bieber's pecs, filled out his abs and bestowed him pubes in this ad from the campaign; furthermore, virtually every celebrity photoshoot in America gets touched up at some point. Why would Bieber's dick be a grand outlier?)","But in many ways this dispute is just a lead-in to an essential American question: What exactly is Bieber packing?","Let's be true detectives.","This is a screencap taken from a video of the Calvin Klein shoot that Bieber himself posted to Instagram. Here we have a direct, unaltered view of his package and can plainly see that it looks quite different than the massive knot he is sporting in the photo advertisement. Front-bulge will almost always look less impressive than side-bluge, granted, and this is a fine bulge, certainly, but one that seems far off of Calvin Klein's idealized Burmese python.","Last September, Bieber appeared onstage at the Fashion Rocks concert. For some reason he stripped down to his underwear, which produced a number of generally alarming photos such as this one.","There are a number of things we can glean from this photo. One is that Justin Bieber has muscles. Look at the strong boy! Another is that his happy trail does indeed appear to stop abruptly right about where it does in the pre-Photoshop version of the Calvin Klein shot in which a model gropes him. But because Bieber wore jet black briefs that reveal no hint of bulge, this photo doesn't help us understand how big his dick actually is.","For that, we must consult more candid shots.","In 2013, Bieber went to Hawaii and jumped off a cliff. After exiting the water, he was photographed walking on the beach, resulting in the image you see here:","This is perhaps the most revealing shot of Bieber's bulge in the wild. Does it look exceedingly large? I'd say not. In fact, it looks like any man's normal penis. Of course, it should be noted that it's unfair to judge a dick by what it looks like immediately after being submerged in the sea. However we can only work with the materials we have.","Next we will consult a Tumblr called Justin Bieber's Bulge, a blog \"dedicated to Justin Bieber's glorious, wonderful bulge,\" which is not run by me. For a Tumblr devoted to one man's dick, it's a pretty boring blog, but there is one compelling photo.","Here is a fan shot of Justin Bieber in concert, his leather drop-crotch pants dropped well below his crotch. We can see a hint of bulge, and from this angle it does not look like Justin Bieber is trying to smuggle a butternut squash through airport security, as Calvin Klein might want us to believe.","That is evidence supporting the theory that Justin Bieber is adequately endowed. Arguing in favor of Justin Bieber's alleged big dick are two people: Tati Neves, a Brazilian model, and Bieber's trainer Patrick Nilsson. These two claim to have seen Bieber's flesh in the flesh, and if we're to believe them, Calvin Klein has staked its reputation on the right massive dong.","Neves claims to have slept with Bieber during his infamous Brazilian sex romp. Here is what she told a British tabloid about Bieber's D:","Speaking to The Sun, Brazilian model Tati Nevas said: \"Take it from me, he's well endowed - and very good in bed.\"","Nilsson, meanwhile, was shuttled out to do damage control in the wake of the Calvin Klein Photoshop controversy. Here, according to Breathe Heavy, is his assessment:","And to make up it, here's a new quote from Justin's trainer Patrick Nilsson, who says JB is packing. \"I can definitely confirm that he is a well-endowed guy. I sound weird saying that, but yes.\"","Indeed you do.","Two people claim to have personal connections with Justin Bieber's dick and claim it is large, but one is on Justin Bieber's payroll. While we will consider their opinions, the overwhelming visual evidence suggests that Justin Bieber's penis is perfectly average\u2014large enough to adequately fill out a pair of briefs, but not so large that it could arouse envy and terror when plastered across sprawling billboards, or choke a cow, without enhancement.","In this case, it appears, Justin Bieber is the same as any man.","Still, we don't know for sure, and here is where we turn to you, our readers: Have you ever had sex with Justin Bieber? Have you ever seen his dick? Do you know someone who has? Are you Scooter Braun? Let's settle this debate once and for all.

{"postId":"824751286306353152","postText":["Three remain from the Class of '98.\n\nAll three are legends."],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["As of Thursday morning, Vince Carter is the lone member of the NBA's active 40-and-older club. At least a couple of his draft classmates are still around to help Carter celebrate his birthday.","Paul Pierce, 39, knows this season will be his last. Dirk Nowitzki, 38, hopes his body will let him play at least one more. Carter's feelings about his basketball future fluctuate, but the old man pulled off a half-amazing 360 layup in traffic on the last night of his thirties against the Raptors that raised him.","For now, though, the three legends are the only ones left standing from the Class of 1998 -- unless you count the No. 23 overall pick, Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue.","The forgettable career of the first overall pick, Los Angeles Clippers center Michael Olowokandi, has been over for a decade. Robert \"Tractor\" Traylor was selected by the Dallas Mavericks at No. 6 and swapped for a floppy-haired German kid a few picks later in a deal with the Milwaukee Bucks. After being out of the league for six years, Traylor died of a heart attack in 2011 while playing in Puerto Rico.","The rest of the top 10 -- No. 2 Mike Bibby, No. 3 Raef LaFrentz, No. 4 Antawn Jamison, No. 7 Jason Williams and No. 8 Larry Hughes -- all enjoyed some success but combined for a grand total of two All-Star appearances between them. The active trio has long stood head and shoulders above the rest of the class.","Carter, the No. 5 pick -- who was traded for Jamison, his friend and North Carolina teammate, on draft night -- soared to eight All-Star appearances with the Toronto Raptors and New Jersey Nets. Once known as \"Half Man, Half Amazing,\" Carter redefined his game as he aged, becoming a sage role player in recent years, now helping the Memphis Grizzlies fight for playoff positioning in the Western Conference.","Nowitzki, the No. 9 pick despite not being sure of his desire to play in the NBA at the time, forced folks to change the way they think about 7-footers while he climbed to sixth on the league's all-time scoring list. He remains the face of the franchise in Dallas, the only NBA city he'll ever call home.","A sore right Achilles tendon robbed Nowitzki of most of the first two months of this season, and most likely a chance to play in the postseason for the 16th time in 17 years, although the big German refuses to give up hope.","Pierce, the No. 10 pick, will one day see his No. 34 raised to the rafters in Boston alongside the other Celtics greats, presumably pretty soon. \"The Truth\" has played for three teams in four seasons since leaving Boston, reuniting with coach Doc Rivers for his final stop with the Clippers, for whom Pierce is a part-time player but full-time locker room presence.","Nowitzki (29,757), Pierce (26,361) and Carter (24,295) have combined for 80,413 career points and have an outside shot to be the highest-scoring draft trio in NBA history. They rank behind only the Class of '84 (Michael Jordan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Charles Barkley with 82,995 points) and Class of '96 (Kobe Bryant, Ray Allen and Allen Iverson with 82,516).","The '98 greats separately sat down with ESPN recently for a three-way Q&A.","Nowitzki: I didn't go to the draft. I actually worked out with Holger [Geschwindner, Nowitzki's shooting coach] those couple of days, and I stayed at Holger's house. We couldn't watch it anywhere. It wasn't on TV back in Germany. I remember in the middle of the night, we got a call and it was [then-Mavericks coach] Don Nelson. He was like, 'Hey, we just drafted you guys. We'd love to come over and see you guys,' because I had said that I wasn't sure if I was coming [to the NBA] or not.","I was like, 'This is crazy!' After the whole Hoop Summit, I guess there was a little hype, but I never thought somebody would take a chance on me that high, especially after saying that I wasn't sure if I would come or not, worried about basically going from the second division to the NBA. That was a huge jump, and I was a little worried. It was bizarre. 'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible.","Then [Mavericks GM Donnie Nelson] and Nellie came maybe a couple of days later. They showed up in Wurzburg. [Then-Mavericks owner] Ross Perot came in the private plane. I had this press conference in this small little hotel that I'll never forget. It was unbelievable. I remember like maybe two or three media people showed up, because it was on such short notice, right? Ross was the one who wanted the press conference, but we couldn't even get a TV station there. There was literally like three people there. It was so bizarre, so bizarre.","\"'Whoa, Dallas took a chance on me at frickin' No. 9?' It was incredible.\"","Dirk Nowitzki, on his reaction to being drafted by the Mavs in 1998","Then Ross flew out again, and Donnie and Nellie stayed for a few days and talked to me over and over. They said, 'Hey, don't make a decision before we fly you to Dallas. We want you to see everything and meet some of the guys.' So I agreed to that. I flew back with Donnie and Holger, stayed at Nellie's house back in the day. Had a press conference. Never had a suit, so I remember right from the airport, we went right to Lombardo's [Custom Apparel in Dallas]. I had the worst jacket on, and we had a press conference.","That's when I met Nashie [Steve Nash] for the first time, because they flew him in for the press conference. It kind of clicked from there. I think on my second night, Nellie threw a little barbecue at his house for me, and Fin [Michael Finley] came and Strick [Erick Strickland] came. Nashie was there and some of the other guys who were in town. I just got to mingle a little bit and meet them and speak as much as I could with my English.","Then the next night was our decision. They set a press conference the morning before I left, and Nellie was like, 'Think about it all night, but we need a decision before you leave.' So that night was rough. I remember I was sitting with Holger around the pool for hours. Obviously, I had concerns. I had concerns about making that huge jump. I'd never lived anywhere but with my parents. I guess the end of the story was, 'We'll try.' They had a young team. It wasn't like they were a great team right [then], not really a playoff team, so you could get some minutes and develop.","Nellie said, 'At the end of the day, if things don't work out, you could always go back to Europe.' That's always an option after two or three years [when] your contract is over. If they don't take the option after three years, you're back home in Europe. So the next day, I went to the press conference and was like, 'I'll try.'","Pierce: I remember slipping and not really knowing where I was going to end up. Because I only worked out for the top five teams.","I remember I didn't know who Jason Williams was, and he got drafted ahead of me. It was just weird. I thought I'd be in the top five, and I slipped all the way to 10, so it was a strange night for me.","And then I go to Boston, a team I really didn't like growing up, because I was a Lakers fan. But you know, things happen for a reason. I guess it was meant for me to be in Boston. It worked out OK.","Carter: You finally get to the draft after working out for five or six teams, and it's the unexpected. We knew either Bibby or Olowokandi was going one or two, and then after that, it's all hearsay. I heard anywhere from three to eight. That's what I hear, so you kind of have to hang your hat on that unless you get that phone call: 'OK, we're going to get you if you're available.'","I just remember sitting around. Olowokandi, OK. Bibby, OK. Raef LaFrentz, great. From there, you really didn't know. I remember sitting at the table next to me was Antawn Jamison. Our families were sitting next to each other, laughing and talking. I remember saying, 'Man, what do you think is going to happen?' We had no idea.","They called Antawn at four. I mean, he was my suitemate in college and very good friends, so [I was] over the moon. It felt like I got drafted, because I was just nervous and excited for him, as if it was me. But the weird thing about it at the time was that he never worked out for Toronto. So it was kind of like, 'OK, well, they just really wanted him.' I worked out for them, and Toronto told me basically, 'If you're available, we're going to go get you, so you might as well come work out.' That's what we were hearing, so I took my workout and everything.","\"I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes.\"","Vince Carter, on being traded from Golden State to Toronto on draft night","But then, they drafted him, so I was just perplexed a little bit, like, 'Wait a minute, what the heck's going on here?' But nevertheless, I was excited for him and like, 'Whatever.' You know, you're just living in the moment.","Then I started looking around. When the camera starts getting close to you, you figure they're talking about you. 'This could be it.' You try to play it cool. Then I get the phone call like right before and they call your name, and it was just over the moon.","I remember getting my hat from [\"hat lady\"] Chrysa Chin, and then I'm walking up the steps and as I'm walking, I see Antawn at the bottom of the steps still. I was like, 'Hey, what's up?' As soon as I took the picture, David Stern says to me, 'Wait right here, there's about to be a trade. We'll go from there.'","OK, I step back. I'm holding my hat, looking at it. The first thing I said is, 'Dang, somebody's getting traded already on draft night.' Dang it, it was me, and it all came together. Well, Antawn I guess got the word that there was going to be a trade. That's why he was sitting there. I didn't know, because of course, by the time it was happening I was already walking up to the stage. It blindsides me, pretty much. But then it all made sense.","I was introduced to the business of basketball pretty much in the first five minutes. I was on the West Coast back to the East Coast in a matter of five minutes. Mind you, everybody [at their tables] had their hat fixed perfectly. Basically, here's your hat to that table, here's your hat to this table. It was a pretty cool thing. Not only did [Jamison and I] get to experience the draft beside each other, but we got traded for each other as well, so it was pretty cool.","Nowitzki: Vince just had unbelievable athleticism. I mean, he did stuff that I don't think we've seen before in this league. I was in Oakland at his dunk contest in [2000], and nobody's ever seen the stuff that he did.","But what kept him so long in the league now was really his skill level, even though obviously he still has some athleticism, still has some hops. But it's his shot, the repertoire of fadeaways that he's got, his 3-ball was always money and he's a big guy for a 2 or 3 that was always good on the block. He'd run a pick-and-roll going to his right, where he was always deadly.","I mean, he was a tough matchup because he could post, and he was so freakishly athletic. He'd come off a down pick and just jump up and really nobody could get to his shot. Obviously, he's so athletic that once he got going to the rim, you could challenge him, but he was going to put you on a poster. He was fun to watch during his prime.","Pierce: He had unique ability, something you hardly see: great athleticism and great shooting touch. Usually you see one without the other. He had the combination of both. That's rare. It's something this league has not seen in a long time.","Pierce: Dirk changed the game, man. When you look at what he was able to bring with his versatility and his shooting as a 7-footer, to be able to put the ball on the ground, he was one of the first stretch 4s that you see more of today. I mean, he revolutionized the game.","Players like that are transcendent. He was a transcendent player.","Carter: First of all, his work ethic. He puts a lot of time in, and it's different than any other player I've ever seen. I've been around long enough to see a lot of guys train and prepare, but he just loves the game. He loves to play. He loves to compete. And he's selfless. He's all about the good of the team.","That's one thing, having the opportunity to play with a go-to guy, a superstar like himself, is that he's willing to make the right play. It's not always like, 'The play is for me; I have to make the shot.' 'The play is for me; I have to make the right play,' that's his mentality. But when he wants the ball, he's going to say, 'Give me the ball.'","He's a professional scorer. I say this about myself, too, and you could probably say it about Paul as well: When you see him walk into the arena before a game, you could probably say there's no way in hell that those guys are playing tonight. Then Dirk will come in and drop 35. Regardless of how he feels before the game, once the big lights are on and you come on the court, he knows how to get it done, plain and simple.","Nowitzki: He was strong. He'd get to his spots. He was a clutch shooter. He definitely had the clutch gene. Great pump fake, could get to the foul line. I mean, he was the complete package from the small forward standpoint. You put a smaller guy on him, he was able to post and shoot over him. Could drive both ways, even ran some pick-and-rolls.","And when it mattered, he made big shots. I wouldn't say he was a great flat-out 3-point shooter, but when the game was on the line, you never really wanted him shooting the 3. He was a competitor and really just a great all-around player.","Carter: He was a killer. He's been like that since high school. I remember us playing against each other in the McDonald's [All-American Game] and just being around each other. He's always had the mentality to score and wanted to dominate while having the ability to do whatever he wanted.","He had the big body and he knew how to use it. There are some people who are big and strong, but they don't use it like that. Paul used it. And he was deceptively quick, so when he got the ball in the logo area and he would swing through and put his body on you, you just hope he missed.","I've had many, many, many great battles against him and know him very well. Of course, we all know Paul can shoot the heck out of the basketball from the 3-point line. He's just another professional scorer.","Nowitzki: I was always the young guy, the German wunderkind, the young guy coming up with talent. It felt like the next thing you know, I was 30. Those years just flew by. You're having fun, you're competing every year, and then in the summer, it's not like I was just sitting on my butt in my 20s. I played national team every year, so literally I took like two weeks off and then was right back in the gym working with Holger. If you stay busy, time flies. So my 20s, I felt like they were over in a heartbeat.","Next thing you know, you're 30 and you're sort of like a mid-aged guy. Couple of young guys, but still a couple older guys. Then the last few years, you're just the oldest guy. It's amazing how 19 years just have flown by. But if you stay busy, if you have a blast ...","Now, I'm still trying to compete. I enjoy doing it. Obviously, it's not as easy as back in the day. All the extra work you have to put in to stay ready. Now dealing with injuries that I really never had, it takes the fun away a little bit, but hopefully I can [stay healthy] and have fun.","Pierce: Oh, it's fun. I'm enjoying every moment. Shootaround, I'm enjoying. The bus rides, the plane rides with the guys, I'm enjoying every last bit of camaraderie that I'm going to get with my team.","In the locker room, on the court, I'm just soaking it all in. I've been around this game for a long time -- a lot of plane rides, a lot of bus rides, a lot of pregame speeches, a lot of national anthems. I'm enjoying the ride, man.","I know this is the last year, so I'm enjoying it as much as I can.","Carter: I'm a little uneasy sometimes. Some days, I'm OK with it. I know it's near, and I'm preparing myself for it. But some days, I'm like, 'Man, I'm not ready to walk away from it,' because I still enjoy being in the gym. I still enjoy running around and competing and laughing and joking. There's nothing better when you've done this so long. It's all you know. Maybe not all I know, but all I've done and all I've enjoyed doing at this point.","Now, I'm prepared to move on to Phase 2. But it's kind of like, you do all the preparation to be prepared, but you're not prepared, if that makes sense. I remember seeing all of the other guys [with the Raptors], seeing Oak [Charles Oakley] and Antonio [Davis] and Kevin Willis and [Hakeem] Olajuwon, watching them in their final years. Then they stepped out in the world and were just kind of like, 'Where do I go from here?' I mean, those guys were prepared.","It's something I never really thought about until -- I'm going to say five years ago: just making sure I'm ready. Because you hear the stories about guys who step out into the world when they retire, and it's like, 'All right, I have some money in my pocket. Where do I go?' Then just spending and spending, and you hear the next horror story that they go broke. That's something that I vow never to do.","For me, an idle mind is just awful. I think I'd be a miserable person, and I'd get on a lot of people's nerves if I'm retired and I have nothing to do. I can't just sit around. People are like, 'Oh, you get to retire and go to all these countries and visit.' I can't do that. That's not who I am. I'm not a vacation guy like that. I wouldn't like it. I know that, so I'd have to find something to do. That's where Phase 2 started years ago as far as kind of introducing myself to different people and figuring out what I'm really passionate about.","The coaching thing is still up in the air. I get asked about it all the time. I enjoy it, but I don't know if I want to do it. It's just the weirdest thing. I guess it makes sense, but to me, it still doesn't make sense. How is it that you enjoy it, have been doing it all these years but can see yourself [coaching full time]? I really can't see myself as a coach as of right now. In the broadcasting world, I can see it clear as day. I'm still fighting with that.","Other than that, I'm ready to go when the time is [right]. There's some mornings I wake up and it's like, 'Is it one more year? Or is it this year? Or is it three years?' I can never decide on a number. Scary. It really is for me, because I love this game, and I don't want to leave it. Not yet.","Nowitzki: [Heavy sigh.] That sounds like a lot. But you know, hopefully I can [stay] out there and I can score a few. Vince has been on a tear for a while, and Paul I don't think is playing much, but you know we're going to try. All three of us are competitors. I think as you get older, it's more important to be on a winning team. I'm sure Vince is enjoying that [the Grizzlies] are playing well, and Paul is enjoying the Clippers. We need some work.","Pierce: It's going to be tough. It's not looking good. I'm not playing much. Our only chance is Vince Carter now. Dirk has been hurt. But who knows? Man, we've got a shot. We've got a shot. But I think LeBron [James], [Dwyane] Wade and [Carmelo Anthony] are going to crush it. LeBron, Wade and Melo are coming. And they're coming fast.","Carter: It's possible. It's possible. I mean, God willing with health, of course, and opportunity. I think it's possible if we stay healthy. Dirk wants to play another year, and with his ability to score, he's going to get touches. I'm putting all of the pressure on him."],"targetTitle":"The twilight tales of Vince Carter, Dirk Nowitzki and Paul Pierce","targetDescription":"The last holdovers from the Class of '98 discuss draft-night stories, plans for life after basketball and where they rank among the best draft trios in NBA history.","targetKeywords":"NBA, Dirk Nowitzki, Vince Carter, Paul Pierce, 1998 draft, 1998-99, NBA, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, LA Clippers","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["Vince Carter","Paul Pierce","Dirk Nowitzki"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,24],[0,36]],[[1,0],[1,11]],[[1,53],[1,66]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":46}

What about us?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["\"We were always thinking there would be more contagious cancer out there, but we didn\u2019t know where they would be discovered,\" said Elizabeth P. Murchison, a cancer biologist at the University of Cambridge who was not involved in the new study.","In the traditional view of cancer, mutations strike a cell. These mutations have several causes, including toxins and viruses.","However they arise, they drive a cell to multiply uncontrollably until the cancer is wiped out by the immune system or kills its victim. Either way, the cancer stays inside the body where it started.","A decade ago, scientists discovered two exceptions. In the 1990s Tasmanian devils in Australia began developing deadly face tumors. But DNA in the tumor cells did not match that of the affected animals, studies showed.","Tasmanian facial tumor disease, as it was eventually called, appears to have had its start in a single Tasmanian devil that lived in the 1980s. Transmitted by bites, the cancer spread to other Tasmanian devils and acquired mutations along the way that helped make it even more infectious. A second strain of the cancer was identified last year.","Dogs, too, can get a type of contagious cancer called canine transmissible venereal tumor, which jumps from host to host during sex. The tumor usually disappears in a few months, however. Scientists have determined that the cancer originated in dogs 11,000 years ago.","For years, Tasmanian devils and dogs were the only species known to contract contagious cancer. But last year, Stephen P. Goff, a molecular biologist at Columbia University, and his colleagues found contagious cancer in soft-shell clams.","From New York to Prince Edward Island, these clams have suffered from aggressive tumors since the 1970s. Carol Reinisch, a marine biologist at Environment Canada, found that the cancer clustered in populations, as if it was caused by an outbreak of some sort.","She suspected a cancer-causing virus moving from host to host. For help, Dr. Reinisch turned to Dr. Goff.","The two researchers found no evidence of a virus in the soft-shell clams. But they did discover that DNA in the tumor cells carried a genetic sequence not found in healthy cells in the clams.","After examining the DNA, they confirmed that the cancer cells in different clams all came from a single common ancestor.","\"Somehow, this cancer has been spreading from clam to clam up the coast,\" Dr. Goff said.","He and his colleagues began to wonder if other species of clams or related animals \u2014 known collectively as bivalves \u2014 had contagious cancers of their own, and, if so, why. They chose to study cancers in mussels, cockles and golden carpet shell clams.","In every case, the researchers reported in the journal Nature, the cancers in the animals were contagious. \"We are now at four for four,\" Dr. Goff said.","As it turned out, the cancer in cockles comprises two separate strains. Even stranger, the cancer cells in the golden carpet shell clams did not develop from the species\u2019s own cells.","Instead, the scientists matched the cancer\u2019s DNA to pullet shell clams, which live in the same intertidal beds off the coast of Spain. But Dr. Goff and his colleagues could not locate any pullet shell clams with this disease.","They concluded that this strain of contagious cancer must have started in pullet shell clams and then jumped species, infecting golden carpet shell clams. It killed all the vulnerable pullet shell clams, leaving only resistant ones behind.","\"That\u2019s really quite incredible,\" Dr. Murchison said, noting that scientists had tried without success to infect foxes and other dog relatives with canine cancer. The new study, she said, shows that contagious cancer can indeed cross the species barrier.","With eight contagious cancers now on the books, Dr. Murchison has started to wonder if they are not as peculiar as previously thought. \"They might be emerging fairly often,\" she said.","So should people worry about an outbreak of infectious cancer? \"I don\u2019t think we should be starting to panic,\" Dr. Murchison said.","There have been rare reports of people transmitting cancer. An estimated 0.04 percent of organ transplant recipients contract cancer from the donor organ, for example. But in these cases, the cancer does not spread like a true parasite from host to host.","Yet it\u2019s not inconceivable that a human cancer might gain that power. In 1965, scientists put mosquitoes in a cage with hamsters, one of which had cancer. The mosquito carried the cancer cells to the healthy hamsters.","The new research \"does raise the possibility that these types of diseases could arise in humans,\" Dr. Murchison said.","Dr. Goff and his colleagues are now trying to turn the contagious cancer in shellfish into a model for human cancers. They hope to find clues to metastasis, the way cancer spreads through the body.","The evolution of a contagious cancer in some ways may mirror the evolution of a single tumor in the body. In shellfish, Dr. Murchison said, \"we can see the effect of evolution on their genomes in a more pronounced way.\""],"targetTitle":"Cancer Is Contagious Among Clams.

Mark Hitchcock of Faith Bible Church in Edmond, Okla., speculates that people looking for answers in tough economic and political times \"want to know that God is in charge.

He said that previous U.S. military actions like the war in Afghanistan or 1990s air strikes on Bosnia \"didn't get the same reaction.\" However, Syria's shared border with Israel, as well as the explicit Biblical mention of Damascus, may account for the significant number of affirmative responses.","Stetzer said that he could see why attaching Biblical significance to the Syria conflict would appeal to many Christians, because, \"For Christians, the end of the world doesn\u2019t mean despair.

Researchers at the University of Washington\u2019s Dog Aging Project are quick to point that out when they talk about their hopes for rapamycin.","The drug, also known as sirolimus, was originally developed and prescribed to prevent rejection of transplanted organs in humans, and also to fight cancer. However, in low doses, rapamycin was shown to slow aging processes and increase the lifespan of mice.","The drug is currently being tested on 32 middle-aged dogs (6-9 years old) for its affects on both increase canine longevity and dogs\u2019 overall health. The trial will last up to six months, after which, the dogs will continue to be monitored to hopefully determine an increase in life expectancy.

Just this week, Loyola Marymount University, a Catholic university in Los Angeles, also announced that it will eliminate elective abortion coverage for its staff starting next year.","The move by both universities was met with outrage by some of its staff, who thought there should have been more dialogue before a decision was made.","\"The policy comes as quite a shock,\" Nancy Unger, a history professor at Santa Clara, said to NBC. \"There was no discussion.

This is a university!\""],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["This fall, protests at Yale, Princeton, Duke and the University of Missouri \u2014 where the chancellor and system president resigned in the midst of turmoil \u2014 drew national attention to the concerns many students have about how minorities are treated on campus.","The protests have also prompted debate about freedom of speech and whether students should be protected from words and ideas that make them uncomfortable.","Everett Piper, president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, weighed in with a letter to the campus community:","This past week, I actually had a student come forward after a university chapel service and complain because he felt \"victimized\" by a sermon on the topic of 1 Corinthians 13. It appears that this young scholar felt offended because a homily on love made him feel bad for not showing love! In his mind, the speaker was wrong for making him, and his peers, feel uncomfortable.","I\u2019m not making this up. Our culture has actually taught our kids to be this self-absorbed and narcissistic! Any time their feelings are hurt, they are the victims! Anyone who dares challenge them and, thus, makes them \"feel bad\" about themselves, is a \"hater,\" a \"bigot,\" an \"oppressor,\" and a \"victimizer.\"","I have a message for this young man and all others who care to listen. That feeling of discomfort you have after listening to a sermon is called a conscience! An altar call is supposed to make you feel bad! It is supposed to make you feel guilty! The goal of many a good sermon is to get you to confess your sins \u2014 not coddle you in your selfishness. The primary objective of the Church and the Christian faith is your confession, not your self-actualization!","So here\u2019s my advice:","If you want the chaplain to tell you you\u2019re a victim rather than tell you that you need virtue, this may not be the university you\u2019re looking for. If you want to complain about a sermon that makes you feel less than loving for not showing love, this might be the wrong place.","If you\u2019re more interested in playing the \"hater\" card than you are in confessing your own hate; if you want to arrogantly lecture, rather than humbly learn; if you don\u2019t want to feel guilt in your soul when you are guilty of sin; if you want to be enabled rather than confronted, there are many universities across the land (in Missouri and elsewhere) that will give you exactly what you want, but Oklahoma Wesleyan isn\u2019t one of them.","At OKWU, we teach you to be selfless rather than self-centered. We are more interested in you practicing personal forgiveness than political revenge. We want you to model interpersonal reconciliation rather than foment personal conflict. We believe the content of your character is more important than the color of your skin. We don\u2019t believe that you have been victimized every time you feel guilty and we don\u2019t issue \"trigger warnings\" before altar calls.","Oklahoma Wesleyan is not a \"safe place\", but rather, a place to learn: to learn that life isn\u2019t about you, but about others; that the bad feeling you have while listening to a sermon is called guilt; that the way to address it is to repent of everything that\u2019s wrong with you rather than blame others for everything that\u2019s wrong with them. This is a place where you will quickly learn that you need to grow up!","This is not a day care. This is a university!"],"targetTitle":"College president: \u2018This is not a day care.

Ms. Lepucki\u2019s agent is negotiating rights with the producer Gregg Fienberg and Killer Films. Little, Brown and Company, the Hachette division behind \"California,\" has increased the initial print order and doubled the length of her author tour.","Ms. Lepucki found herself in Portland, Ore., this week to sign 10,000 copies of her novel for the independent superstore Powell\u2019s Books, where \"California\" hit No. 1 on the best-seller list after Mr. Colbert directed viewers there.","\"Occasionally, my brain would overheat, and I\u2019d forget how to write,\" she said of her signing session. \"My signature is like a squished spider.\"","How Ms. Lepucki ended up as perhaps the only author to benefit from the Amazon-Hachette spat over pricing is a tale of almost unbelievable luck. And it has a twist: Her husband, Patrick Brown, is employed, in a sense, by Amazon. He works for Goodreads, a social network and peer recommendation engine for books; Amazon acquired it last year.","\"Amazon has historically been a bully, and I don\u2019t shop there,\" Ms. Lepucki said. \"But I love Goodreads. For the record. And my marriage.\"","Mr. Colbert\u2019s promotion of \"California\" started with Sherman Alexie, an anti-Amazonian and National Book Award winner for \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.\" Mr. Colbert invited Mr. Alexie on his show and asked him to bring a book by an author penalized by Amazon\u2019s refusal to take Hachette preorders. Mr. Alexie said that he asked Hachette for a few advance copies of books by debut authors to peruse.","\"California\" was on the top of the stack. \"I honestly suspected it wasn\u2019t going to be my kind of book \u2014 too earnest,\" Mr. Alexie said in a telephone interview. \"But I started reading it, and it turned out to be an earnest page turner.\"","With its post-apocalyptic setting, \"California\" mines a very busy vein in contemporary fiction. But Ms. Lepucki sees it as a love story. A young couple, Frida and Cal, have fled the ruins of Los Angeles to make a home in the wilderness. Everything changes when Frida becomes pregnant, and they leave isolation for a strange settlement filled with threats.","It seems impossible that a story with such dark undercurrents could spring from someone so laid-back and gregarious. Over breakfast in Los Angeles, where she grew up, the freckled Ms. Lepucki displayed a surferish vibe, right down to the wet blond hair that she twisted to the side as she spoke. Still, her eyes, which are a striking shade of blue, had a tendency to flash mischievously.","\"I have a darker imagination than most people,\" she said. \"If you don\u2019t ponder the end of the world on a regular basis, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really human.\"","Ms. Lepucki winced when asked if the couple in \"California\" is modeled on her and her husband. It\u2019s an easy guess to make, especially since she became pregnant with their 3-year-old son, Dixon Bean, while writing.","But no. \"I\u2019m madly in love with my husband, but it\u2019s not us,\" she said. \"People seem to hate Frida, so I hope I\u2019m not her.\" (Her mother-in-law\u2019s response to the book: \"I\u2019m sad she killed me in a blizzard.\")","Ms. Lepucki is a graduate of Oberlin College and the University of Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop, and is the founder and director of Writing Workshops Los Angeles, which has drawn 1,300 participants since it began in 2008. She is also known in book circles as a writer for The Millions, a highbrow literary website.","\"California\" is actually her second novel. But the first, a disturbing story about teenage girls that her agent, Erin Hosier, called \"the novel equivalent of a Harmony Korine movie,\" failed to sell to a publisher. \"It was overly ambitious,\" Ms. Hosier said. \"We finally stopped trying to sell it, because the rejection became too embarrassing and painful.\"","That put more pressure on \"California.\" \"You really can\u2019t fail twice in a row if you have her credentials,\" Ms. Hosier said.","Even before the boost from Mr. Colbert, \"California\" was receiving praise from respected novelists like Jennifer Egan and Ben Fountain and popping up on summer reading lists. Little, Brown ultimately printed 60,000 hardcovers.","But insta-fame feels more than a little weird, and she confessed to feeling awkward about the experience of being interviewed. She had another confession to make, too: Yes, she shuns Amazon, but just to be honest she did once buy a tin of Bag Balm, a salve first developed to soothe cow udders. \"I had a chapped elbow,\" she explained."],"targetTitle":"Edan Lepucki\u2019s Novel \u2018California\u2019 Gets a Boost From Colbert","targetDescription":"A budding writer\u2019s first published novel got a big lift from mentions on \"The Colbert Report.\"","targetKeywords":"Lepucki  Edan,California (Book),Book Trade and Publishing,Books and Literature,The Colbert Report (TV Program),Hachette Book Group,Amazon.com Inc,Colbert  Stephen,Television,Colbert Report  The (TV Program)","targetMedia":["https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2014\/07\/03\/arts\/jplepucki1\/jplepucki1-master315.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2014\/07\/03\/arts\/03LEPUCKI\/03LEPUCKI-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2014\/07\/03\/arts\/jplepucki2\/jplepucki2-master315.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2014\/07\/03\/arts\/03LEPUCKI\/03LEPUCKI-master1050.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1mLhc3S","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":".@EdanL","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["Edan Lepucki"],"spoilerPositions":[[[-1,0],[-1,12]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":56}

Spouses of players were invited to the event, which was held between April 4 and April 7 in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.","Meet the NFL player who lived in a utility closet in college to save money (1:31) Tim Masthay, of the Green Bay Packers, and his wife Amanda are the best team in the NFL when it comes to personal finance.","When we asked the Masthays what they did with his first big NFL paycheck, they said a big chunk went toward the league\u2019s 401(k) plan and another went into an education fund for their young children.","And when asked if he ever had to switch financial advisers like many athletes do because they\u2019re not happy with the advice or returns they\u2019re getting, Tim said he\u2019s never had one.

They married soon after graduating and have two children and a third on the way. They\u2019re clearly a great team, but what made them so smart about money? Here\u2019s what they shared with us.","What it\u2019s like to make so much money while you\u2019re in your 20s","Tim wasn\u2019t drafted out of college but was signed \u2014 and released \u2014 by the Indianapolis Colts before the 2009 season started. He later signed with the Green Bay Packers and has had great success with them. He signed a five-year, $6 million contract in 2012 that included a $1.2 million signing bonus. And he won a Super Bowl with the Packers in 2011.","I almost fell on the floor when I saw his first paycheck. Amanda Masthay","While Tim was trying to make an NFL roster, Amanda was working as a bank teller making $9 an hour. \"That was all the money we had. So we went from getting by to the first paycheck that he got. I almost fell on the floor when I saw it. I had never seen that much money in my life,\" Amanda said.","They were tempted to buy things when they got the check. \"It took a lot of restraint and we sort of had to wrap our heads around it so that we didn\u2019t buy some car that we really couldn\u2019t afford,\" she said.","Tim says that first paycheck was for $9,000, and that while it was a lot of money to him, too, it was at the league minimum. \"There was this influx of money at a young age where we were accustomed to being on scholarship, but it wasn\u2019t quite as traumatic as what some players who are top draft picks experience.\"","The unique financial challenges of being an NFL player \u2014 and the wife of a player","When you start making a lot of money in the league, you have to figure out what to do with it, Tim said. \"How do I spend it? How do I save it? How do I budget? How am I going to play? Because it\u2019s very difficult to project how much you\u2019re going to earn in an NFL career. It might be a one-year career, and it might be a five-year career.\"","How the NFL keeps its players from going broke (1:58) See what it's like to attend the NFL's Personal Finance Camp, which trains players on how to make their money last long after they stop playing.","He said another challenge is that they\u2019re only paid during the season, except for a small off-season stipend. \"We receive eight or nine paychecks throughout the year and you\u2019ve got to do all of your budgeting and saving based off of those checks. It\u2019s a little different way of being paid than I think most people are,\" Tim said.","But he also acknowledged that \"if you have some vision for the future, it\u2019s a fantastic opportunity in terms of investment.\"","How they got so smart about money","The Masthays said their educations at the University at Kentucky \u2014 he was an economics major and she was a marketing major \u2014 were helpful, and that lessons they learned at a young age were also influential.","\"If we ever went on vacation as kids, I remember being 6 or 7 and my mom would give me a check register and I would do chores around the house and go wash people\u2019s cars and save up for my spending money,\" Amanda said.","Tim said that at Kentucky\u2019s business school he took a class in his sophomore year \u2014 in which he met Amanda, incidentally \u2014 and the professor said if you can save $10,000 when you\u2019re 20 years old and if the stock market were to return what it\u2019s historically returned, you\u2019d have $1 million when you were 60. \"I remember thinking, wow that\u2019s interesting,\" he said.","That made him think of ways he could save some of his scholarship money, which was $750 a month. One way he did that was to live in a utility closet for $100 a month in a house that four of his friends lived in. He said it was just big enough to fit a bed.","\"By the time I graduated I had saved $10,000 while living on a scholarship check. That\u2019s what I bought her wedding ring with,\" he said. (He spent part of it on the ring.)","Tom Szczerbowski\/Getty Images Tim Masthay punting in a game against the Buffalo Bills on Dec. 14, 2014.","One mistake?","Tim said one area they could have been smarter in is real estate.

(The legislation would not prevent the hiring of guest faculty to conduct classes for which students receive credit.)","Another bill would require state colleges to distribute student fees to pay for guest speakers \"proportionally based on membership\" of the student groups inviting the speaker.","Both of these bills were authored by state Sen. Stacey Campfield (R-Knoxville) and were scheduled for their first committee vote on Wednesday. They are being pushed in response to Sex Week, a week-long student-organized and student-funded event at UT's Knoxville campus discussing sexuality, LGBT issues, sexual health and related topics.","Campfield previously gained national recognition -- and stirred national controversy -- in 2012 for his \"Don't Say Gay\" bill, which would have prevented schoolteachers from discussing homosexuality. The legislation ultimately did not pass that year or when it was resurrected in 2013.","Last week, two other state senators -- Education Committee Chairwoman Dolores Gresham (R-Somerville) and Government Operations Committee Chairman Mike Bell (R-Riceville) -- issued a letter to university leaders warning that state funding for the university may be in jeopardy, even though no taxpayer funds went toward Sex Week.","Gov. Bill Haslam (R) has not said whether he would sign the bills into law.","University leaders have repeatedly explained to lawmakers that they could not block Sex Week because the First Amendment protects college students' right to speak, and legal experts have backed them up. Bell and Gresham argued in their letter that the university could have shut down the event on the grounds that it was obscene. But UT system President Joe DiPietro told the Chattanooga Times Free Press that the university did not have \"any indication from anybody that there's an obscenity situation at all in this program.\"","Attendance at Sex Week increased this year, according to the school's Daily Beacon. Sex Week organizers told HuffPost that there have been no protests against it on campus, while an UT administrator said in February that the university had received no calls of complaint from local community members or alumni.","Nonetheless, the Tennessee state House has already passed a resolution condemning the students who organized Sex Week, which the House called \"an atrocious event.\"","On Monday, a petition opposing Campfield's bills, signed by 3,500 students, was presented at the statehouse. In addition, 650 student letters were sent to lawmakers Friday.","A UT-Knoxville graduate student provided The Huffington Post with a form email she received from Campfield in response to her objections to his legislation. The lawmaker said:","While I support diversity of thought at the university, what is currently in place is not diversity. Sadly, when you look at a list of the paid speakers for the university the vast majority are from one point of view and balancing points of view are minimized.","UT administration and faculty leaders, who firmly oppose both bills, agree with Campfield on that one point -- that a university should be a place where many voices are heard.","\"If people realize we're an institution that doesn't allow outside speakers, I think that could have a significant impact,\" UT faculty senate president David Golden told the TV station WATE. \"I can think of no better place for contradictory, conflicting, controversial ideas to be presented than on a university campus.\""],"targetTitle":"Tennessee Lawmakers Aim To Punish University For 'Sex Week' By Cutting Back Public Debate","targetDescription":"A group of conservative Tennessee lawmakers plan to punish the state's flagship public university over a student-organized event in early March called","targetKeywords":"sex week,ut knoxville,tennessee no speakers bill,tennessee-speakers-bill-sex-week,university of tennessee sex week,UT sex week,stacey campfield,Student Fees,tennessee sex week,tennessee speakers bill,stacey campfield sex week","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1673987\/images\/o-STACEY-CAMPFIELD-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1673987\/images\/n-STACEY-CAMPFIELD-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1frgeGF","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"U of Tennessee","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["University of Tennessee"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,91],[1,114]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":63}

The guidance is given based on the patient\u2019s sign \u2014 whether he or she is an Aries, Taurus, or so forth \u2014 and the leading astrologist develops a star chart for each patient.","Unsurprisingly, the astrology workshop is being met with criticism over its scientific validity.","Diego Andre\u0301s Golombek, a professor at the University of Quilmes in Argentina, told Quartz, \"Astrology can be harmless, of course, unless it gives directions and instructions into how to proceed with, for example, an illness or medical treatment.\"","SEE ALSO: 6 Questions to Ask Before Sharing Science on the Internet","\"And, indeed, having such a program organized by a hospital leads into the completely false assumption that astrology might have some kind of scientific background which, of course, it completely lacks. I am horrified by this prospect!\"","So, based on the evidence (or lack thereof), is there any real science to support astrology?","There are a few foundational ways to evaluate whether a concept is scientific, and the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Understanding Science website lays out a \"Science checklist.\"","1. Does astrology use testable ideas?","For something to have a true scientific basis, it has to encompass testable ideas. However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Some expectations generated by astrology are so general that any outcome could be interpreted as fitting the expectations; if treated this way, astrology is not testable.\"","2. Does it rely on evidence?","There haven\u2019t been many studies that investigate the science behind astrology, but of the few that have, the results have failed to support the validity of astrological views. For instance, a study tested the accuracy of astrological charts in describing the personality traits of 193 study participants, and the results indicated that the scores were at a level consistent with chance.","So far, it can\u2019t be said that astrology relies on replicable scientific evidence \u2014 and replicability is a must for an idea to prove itself as valid.","3. Does it attempt to explain the natural world?","Yes, astrology\u2019s basic premise is that the sun, moon, planets, and constellations have an effect on humans and earthly events. Further, it uses a set of rules about the relative positions and movements of the stars and planets to predict and explain worldly events and human personality.","However, as Understanding Science explains, \"Although astrologers seek to explain the natural world, they don't usually attempt to critically evaluate whether those explanations are valid \u2014 and this is a key part of science.\"","Plus, astrology doesn\u2019t lead to ongoing research, which is another key part of science.","So, unfortunately for everyone who swears their daily horoscope is always on point or blames their stubbornness on being a Scorpio or a Taurus, it appears that there\u2019s not much scientific evidence to back those claims.

Three years later, Amazon bought the online shoe retailer Zappos for $850 million.","Over the past couple of years, Amazon has ramped up its investment in fashion by launching its own private-label clothing brands and sponsoring the first New York Men's Fashion Week.","The company has also hired executives from luxury fashion companies, such as Julie Gilhart, the Barneys New York fashion director whom Amazon reportedly hired as a consultant, and vogue editor Caroline Palmer.","Also in the past few years, Amazon has started to shift its fashion strategy toward offering more high-end designer names, such as Zac Posen and Stuart Weitzman.","That shift has had some industry experts scratching their heads. Luxury fashion websites are typically well-merchandised and highly curated \u2014 not things for which Amazon is necessarily known.","But Amazon's strategy appears to be working.","Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that Amazon's apparel sales grew by $1.1 billion in the most recent quarter, while the department stores Nordstrom, Sears, Macy's, Kohl's, JCPenney, and Dillard's collectively lost $225 million in apparel sales in the same period.","Department-store executives have blamed declining apparel sales on the weather and on consumers' changing shopping habits, which in recent years have gravitated more toward big-ticket items like televisions and vacations over clothing.","The apparel market has only grown 1% annually in the past 15 years, according to Morgan Stanley.","But department stores' loss so far has been Amazon's gain, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.","\"We expect online (primarily Amazon) will continue to take share from department stores, but at an accelerating pace over the next five years given new evidence that Amazon is gaining traction in fashion,\" the analysts wrote in a recent note.","In a 2012 interview with The New York Times, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos gave a simple reason that Amazon was investing in fashion: \"Gross profit dollars per unit will be much higher on a fashion item,\" than with cheaper products, he said."],"targetTitle":"An unlikely company is crushing America's biggest clothing stores","targetDescription":"Amazon is now second only to Walmart in terms of overall apparel market share.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/static5.businessinsider.de\/assets\/images\/de\/logos\/logo-print.png","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/4459\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/static3.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617add0895265a8b4977-960\/13775532_1454470924570482_2532205567595746135_n.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/18913\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3648\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/5419\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/static3.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617fdd0895265a8b497f\/an-unlikely-company-is-crushing-americas-biggest-clothing-stores.jpg","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/5857b04acca1c7762029bc60-60-60\/bewerbershutterstock60.jpg","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/582c3a38cca1c7b21e0b12c3-556-156\/moneyou-logo-transparent.png","http:\/\/static1.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e86179dd0895265a8b4975-960\/13770301_1460406377310270_2482425890459741285_n.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/imp?imgid=15552517&tmstp=1488657128","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5857b178cdf4df736a14ab58-500-400\/ey-logo-horizontal.png","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5853ad8ecca1c7cf389ba041-600-257\/etoro.png","http:\/\/static3.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e86179dd0895265a8b4976-852\/screen%20shot%202016-09-21%20at%201.28.48%20pm.png","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617bdd0895265a8b497a-960\/13620915_1462346117116296_8134805571558151415_n.jpg","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/56420314dd089541128b4628-50-50\/hayley-peterson.jpg","http:\/\/static6.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617edd0895265a8b497e-100-100\/an-unlikely-company-is-crushing-americas-biggest-clothing-stores.jpg","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-103525h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/static2.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617add0895265a8b4979-960\/13873192_1467720896578818_2136960234680647516_n.jpg","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/5853ad19cdf4df847a27ac39-60-60\/robo-adviser.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3650\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617add0895265a8b4978-960\/13726860_1453633111320930_3319313363619930103_n.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3651\/S\/14886535281\/","http:\/\/atsfi.de\/s.png?b=2","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/58887e2bf4c01d31008b52a3-1877-939\/oracle-hcm-logo-white.png","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/57e8617bdd0895265a8b497b-883\/screen%20shot%202016-09-21%20at%201.28.23%20pm.png","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/582c3bc9cca1c76d1a0b12c3-60-60\/sparenwachstumcarballoshutterstock60.jpg","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5891fdaacca1c7fd0de51217-60-60\/blindkommunikation60x60.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/amazon-fashion-sales-are-booming-2016-9","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"It's Amazon","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["Amazon"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,77],[0,83]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":69}
{"postId":"4xney3","postText":["Shower Habits You Need To Stop Doing Immediately"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Did you know theres actually a right way to shower? Get ready turn down that water temperature and drop the shampoo. Here are the things you need to stop doing while showering.","Showering is\u2014and should be\u2014a daily habit for most of us, and everyone has their own routine. Some people can\u2019t live without washing their hair each day while others chose to skip a day or two, and the differences continue on from there.","However, did you know that some of the most common shower habits might not actually be that healthy? Believe it or not, some of the things you do every day while taking a shower could be affecting you in ways you\u2019ve never thought of.","Check out this list to see if your shower habits are doing you more harm than good.","1. Washing Your Face","Without a doubt, it\u2019s easier and less messy to wash your face when you\u2019re already in the shower. However, despite the convenience, it\u2019s actually not good for your face. The water that you shower in will typically be much hotter than what you\u2019d wash with at the sink, and the high temperature can make your skin dry out very quickly.","Those with skin conditions such as acne or rosacea may also find that washing their face with hot water can cause excessive redness and irritation\u2014it could even burst a blood vessel in your face if you wash too aggressively. Use a gentle cleanser and avoid washing your face in the shower, particularly if you have acne-prone skin or rosacea.","2. Not Washing Your Feet","You might be thinking that your feet make contact with plenty of water while you\u2019re in the shower, so there\u2019s no real reason to actually bend down and give them a proper wash. You\u2019d be wrong, though.","Even if you\u2019re not prone to smelly feet, think about how sweaty your feet can get throughout the day. Not only that, but if you\u2019re known to walk around the house or outdoors without socks or shoes, you never know what you might be picking up along the way.","There\u2019s no excuse for just letting the soap suds run down to your toes anymore\u2014imagine what you\u2019re bringing into your bed every night without giving those feet a good wash.","3. Not Washing or Replacing Your Loofah Regularly","Be honest, how long has the same loofah been hanging in your shower? Months? YEARS? As it turns out, that can be terrible for your health. This video demonstrates why:","Consider treating yourself to a new sponge or loofah the next time you\u2019re out, or create a cute and convenient place to hang the one you have for air drying.","4. Using a Soap Dish","Yes, that built-in soap dish is there forever, but using it for its intended purpose actually isn\u2019t that good of an idea. The majority of people don\u2019t use bars of soap these days but, for those who do, be aware that leaving a bar of soap in one spot could be encouraging bacteria to grow on it\u2014bacteria that you\u2019re then going to spread over your entire body the next time you lather up.","If you have reasons for resisting the switch to liquid body wash, try finding a wire soap dish or one that has holes in the bottom so any remaining water can drain away once you\u2019re out of the shower.","5. Using Scented Soaps","Yes, those soaps that make your bathroom smell like a tropical rainforest or a freshly-made vanilla cupcake do transport you to a place of olfactory luxury while sudsing up, but those very fragrances could be doing a number on your skin at the same time.","Anyone who notices their skin seems particularly irritated after a shower should look to their soap as the first culprit. Fragrances can irritate sensitive skin very easily, so it\u2019s best to use something unscented to keep your skin in the best shape. Plus, you won\u2019t have to worry about the scent of your soap mixing with the scent of your perfume to create \"questionable\" smells.","6. Showering in Hard Water","Some people may not even know how to tell if their water is considered hard, but figuring it out and taking steps to adjust it could save your hair and skin from a lot of damage.","Hard water is defined by its high concentration of minerals like magnesium and calcium, which can end up making your skin break out or cause a layer of buildup on your hair. Those with dyed hair may even find that hard water strips the color out of their strands, or at least causes their tint to fade a little quicker.","If you\u2019re unable to add a water softener to your shower, try incorporating a clarifying shampoo into your routine to remove any buildup caused by those pesky minerals.","7. Avoiding Cold Showers","Most people wouldn\u2019t even dream of standing in cold water for more than a second, let alone taking an entire shower in water that\u2019s anything less than steaming hot.","Still, cold water showers can actually be really beneficial for your skin and hair, and you only need 30 seconds under a cold stream to see a difference. A quick blast of cold water is said to improve your immune function, increase your metabolism, and increase the amount of stress you can tolerate.","In addition to speeding up your metabolism, a study done in 2009 suggests that regularly taking a cold shower could even help you lose weight over time.","8. Using Old Razors","For most of us, old razors aren\u2019t something we thoughtfully replace on a regular basis. Instead, they just sit in the shower until we finally cave and get a new one. Razors, whether you\u2019re buying replacement heads or the kind that are entirely disposable, are surprisingly expensive\u2014so why throw one out after a certain period of time if it still seems to work?","Well, just because a razor is shaving off your unwanted hairs doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s doing so effectively. If you notice that your skin gets red and inflamed after you shave, it\u2019s because the blades are dull and it\u2019s time for a replacement.","9. Leaving Your Razor in the Shower","Remember how leaving your wet bar of soap in your dingy old soap dish makes it a breeding ground for bacteria? The same thing goes for your razor. There are plenty of nooks and crannies in your razor that make perfect spots for bacteria to hide, and the problem will only get worse when the razor is sitting in a warm, wet environment.","If you don\u2019t actually want to store your razor outside of the shower, at least make sure that you hang it up when you\u2019re done using it so it can air dry.","10. Over Exfoliating","Giving your skin a gentle scrub every now and then is a good idea, but doing so every day could actually be causing damage. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, your skin actually exfoliates itself by renewing every 27 days or so.","Anyone who chooses to exfoliate their skin every day is aggressively going after fresh skin cells, which can make your skin red and irritated as a result.

Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum","Most of the world didn't know anyone lived in the highlands of Papua New Guinea until the 1930s, when Australian gold prospectors surveying the area realized there were about a million people there.","When researchers made their way to those villages in the 1950s, they found something disturbing. Among a tribe of about 11,000 people called the Fore, up to 200 people a year had been dying of an inexplicable illness. They called the disease kuru , which means \"shivering\" or \"trembling.\"","Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people Once symptoms set in, it was a swift demise. First, they'd have trouble walking, a sign that they were about to lose control over their limbs. They'd also lose control over their emotions, which is why people called it the \"laughing death.\" Within a year, they couldn't get up off the floor, feed themselves or control their bodily functions.","Many locals were convinced it was the result of sorcery. The disease primarily hit adult women and children younger than 8 years old. In some villages, there were almost no young women left.","\"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says \"They were obsessed with trying to save themselves because they knew demographically that they were on the brink of extinction,\" says Shirley Lindenbaum , a medical anthropologist with the City University of New York.","But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After But what was causing it? That answer eluded researchers for years. After ruling out an exhaustive list of contaminants, they thought it must be genetic. So in 1961, Lindenbaum traveled from village to village mapping family trees so researchers could settle the issue.","But Lindenbaum, who continues to But Lindenbaum, who continues to write about the epidemic, knew it couldn't be genetic, because it affected women and children in the same social groups, but not in the same genetic groups. She also knew that it had started in villages in the north around the turn of the century, and then moved south over the decades.","Lindenbaum had a hunch about what was going on, and she turned out to be right. It had to do with funerals. Specifically, it had to do with eating dead bodies at funerals.","In many villages, when a person died, they would be cooked and consumed. It was an act of love and grief.","As one medical researcher As one medical researcher described , \"If the body was buried it was eaten by worms; if it was placed on a platform it was eaten by maggots; the Fore believed it was much better that the body was eaten by people who loved the deceased than by worms and insects.\"","Women removed the brain, Women removed the brain, mixed it with ferns, and cooked it in tubes of bamboo. They fire-roasted and ate everything except the gall bladder. It was primarily adult women who did so, says Lindenbaum, because their bodies were thought to be capable of housing and taming the dangerous spirit that would accompany a dead body.","\"So, the women took on the role of consuming the dead body and giving it a safe place inside their own body \u2014 taming it, for a period of time, during this dangerous period of mortuary ceremonies,\" says Lindenbaum.","But women would occasionally pass pieces of the feast to children. \"Snacks,\" says Lindenbaum. \"They ate what their mothers gave them,\" she says, until the boys hit a certain age and went off to live with the men. \"Then, they were told not to touch that stuff.\"","Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which Finally, after urging from researchers like Lindenbaum, biologists came around to the idea that the strange disease stemmed from eating dead people. The case was closed after a group at the U.S. National Institutes of Health injected infected human brain into chimpanzees, and watched symptoms of kuru develop in the animals months later. The group, which won a Nobel Prize for the findings, dubbed it a \"slow virus.\"","But it wasn't a virus \u2014 or a bacterium, fungus, or parasite. It was an entirely new infectious agent, one that had no genetic material, could survive being boiled, and wasn't even alive.","As As another group would find years later, it was just a twisted protein, capable of performing the microscopic equivalent of a Jedi mind trick, compelling normal proteins on the surface of nerve cells in the brain to contort just like them. The so-called \"prions,\" or \"proteinaceous infectious particles,\" would eventually misfold enough proteins to kill pockets of nerve cells in the brain, leaving the cerebellum riddled with holes, like a sponge.","The process was so odd that The process was so odd that some compared it to Dr. Jekyll's transformation to Mr. Hyde: \"the same entity but in two manifestations \u2014 a 'kind', innocuous one and a 'vicious', lethal one.\"","The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic \u2014 the difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue. The epidemic likely started when one person in a Fore village developed sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease , a degenerative neurological disorder similar to kuru. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in a million people in the U.S. develop CJDthe difference is that others rarely come into contact with infected human tissue.","Though the Fore stopped the practice of mortuary feasts more than 50 years ago, cases of kuru continued to surface over the years, because the prions could take decades to show their effects.","According to According to Michael Alpers , a medical researcher at Curtin University in Australia who tracked kuru cases for decades, the last person with kuru died in 2009. His team continued surveillance until 2012, when the epidemic was officially declared over. \"I have followed up a few rumoured cases since then but they were not kuru,\" he wrote in an email.","Enlarge this image When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum hide caption toggle caption Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum When Shirley Lindenbaum visited a South Fore village in 2008, one man said excitedly, \"See how many children we have now?\" Courtesy Shirley Lindenbaum","But while they remain rare, transmissible prion diseases did not die out with the last kuru case, as people have found repeatedly in recent decades.

People have developed variant CJD after eating the meat of cattle infected with mad cow disease . Dr. Ermias Belay, a prion disease researcher with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that's the only scenario in which there is \"definitive evidence\" that humans can develop a prion disease after eating the infected meat of another species.","But, he says, there are still a lot of open questions about how and why humans get prion diseases.","For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, Nature , is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves. For one, it's still a mystery why animals, including humans, have those proteins in the first place \u2014 the Jekylls that can be so easily turned into Hydes. One leading hypothesis, described recently in the journalNature, is that they play an important role in the protective coating around nerves.","But here's the bigger question, says Belay: \"How many of these diseases actually jump species and affect humans?\"","Kuru showed that people could get a prion disease from eating infected people. Mad cow disease showed that people can get a prion disease from eating infected cow. But what about other prion diseases in other animals? Could, say, hunters get sick from eating infected deer? That's what researchers in North America, including Belay, are trying to find out right now.","\" Chronic wasting disease in North America is spreading fast,\" says Belay. The disease causes infected wild deer and elk to starve to death. \"In early 2000, we had about three states that reported CWD in the wild in deer and elk. Today , that number is 21.\"","Belay says the disease is \"a little bit concerning\" because, unlike mad cow disease and kuru, where infectious prions were concentrated in the brain and nervous system tissue, in an animal with chronic wasting disease, the misfolded prions show up all over the body. They can even be found in saliva, feces and urine, which could explain how the disease is spreading so quickly among wild deer and elk.","The CDC is working with public health authorities in Wyoming and Colorado to monitor hunters for signs of prion disease.","\"Unfortunately, because these diseases have long incubation periods, it's not easy to monitor transmission,\" says Belay.

{"postId":"4xlbw5","postText":["Are lefties really more creative?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["The left-handed brand has come a long way in the last few decades. The majority of people no longer assume that southpaws are tools of Satan, alight with hellfire. Today\u2019s lefties are surrounded by a far more benevolent glow. We associate left-handedness with intelligence, out-of-the-box thinking, and artistic talent. But are these flattering generalizations backed up by science? Does being left-handed really make you more creative?","The answer to that is a definitive ... maybe.","Scientists have been chipping away at the peculiarities of left-handedness, which occurs in about 10 percent of the population, for a long time. They\u2019ve looked into the purported links between left-handedness and things like mental illness, faulty immune systems, and criminal behavior. They\u2019ve studied whether lefties are better at problem-solving, and if they\u2019re more likely to die young. From all these studies on left-handedness, we can conclude one thing, and one thing alone: science is complicated.","A handful of studies have found a link between left-handedness and creativity, conferred, some think, by the fact that left-handed folks constantly have to adjust to a right-handed world. Other studies found no link at all.","Some researchers conclude that lefties are no smarter than righties, while others say that left-handedness comes with a clear intellectual advantage. Is there really a left-handed personality? Are lefties more prone to schizophrenia and learning disabilities? That depends on who you ask.","But \"Are lefties different?\" might not even be the right question. Over the last few years, a number of studies have concluded that it\u2019s not which hand is dominant that matters\u2014it\u2019s the degree of dominance. According to researchers, very few people are truly entirely left- or right-handed; it\u2019s more of a spectrum. We use our left hands for some things and our right hands for other tasks.","These experiments have found that people toward the middle of the spectrum are more flexible thinkers. They seem to be more empathetic and better able to view things from other people\u2019s perspectives. When considering the risks and benefits of any given decision, inconsistent-handed people (as researchers call them) are more likely to focus on the risks, whereas people at the outer edges of the handedness spectrum pay more attention to potential benefits. They may even sleep differently. It seems we\u2019ve been aiming our stereotypes a little too far to the left.","But who knows? This is ever-changing, constantly evolving science. If you\u2019re a lefty who enjoys feeling superior, we\u2019re not going to tell you to tone it down. For all we know, you could be right.","Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

So what can they tell you about yourself? Here's a taste...","By Jena Pincott","\"You're Taking The Wrong Chill Pill\"","Try this to preempt stress-triggered pig-outs: two 1\/4-cup servings daily of yogurt that is (preferably) unsweetened and (crucially) probiotic-enriched (look for B. animalis, S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus). After a month of this regime, volunteers in an fMRI study at UCLA's School of Medicine showed brain activity that's associated with greater emotional stability (a stronger connection between pain-processing circuits and the prefrontal cortex), compared with the non-probiotic control group. One explanation: The good bacteria in yogurt send out signals that increase serotonin, the neurotransmitter that famously reduces anxiety. While most probiotic eaters don't have big mood changes, says lead author Kirsten Tillisch, MD, many (anecdotally) say they feel calmer over time. Ongoing research focuses on the subtle, cumulative, long-term effects of microbes as anxiety reducers.","\"Your Housemates Influence You More Than You Think\"","OK, you don't like yogurt. Or kimchi, tempeh, sauerkraut or other \"friendly-flora\" foods. But if your housemates eat them -- good news! Their healthy brain-boosting microbes have probably taken up residence in you. \"A number of gut microbes form so-called spores -- environmentally hyper-resistant cells that help to colonize them,\" explains James Scott, professor of occupational & environmental health at the University of Toronto. They're found on surfaces and in dust; we inhale and ingest them.","\"You Found Wisdom Among The Dahlias\"","A bacterium in soil called M. vaccae may be a cognitive enhancer, found a study published in Behavioural Processes. After mice ate a peanut-butter-flavored dose of the bug, they navigated mazes twice as fast as those not treated. Turns out, M. vaccae are among the gut bacteria that trigger a rise in serotonin -- which not only calms us but also boosts memory and concentration. (For mice, the \"superbrain\" effect lasted for at least a week after the last exposure.) We inhale and ingest this microbe when we're around dirt and plants; to what extent might it help us navigate life's mazes? Stay tuned.","\"You're Hungry... Very, Very Hungry\"","Surprisingly, gut bacteria may also control appetite, nudging you toward the oozy, creamy, crunchy foods they like. Fact is, the little buggers have species-specific appetites (a microbiologist can tell what types of food you eat and predict whether you're slender or not just from the variety of microbes in your stool sample). \"Bad guy\" bacteria may be partly to blame for your junk-food cravings -- by, for instance, sending out sugar-and-fat-jonesing signals via the gut-to-brain vagus nerve. Plus, some microbes may help you extract more calories from food and increase fat storage -- effectively making you put on weight.","\"You Struggle To Burn Off Your Muffin Top\"","While the blame for a big belly doesn't lie entirely with its wee inhabitants, the wrong microbes can contribute to it and make it harder to lose. In a study led by Liping Zhao at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, a 385-pound patient had unusually high counts of a fat-loving bug called Enterobacter in his gut. Zhao transferred the bacterium to his lab mice -- and here's the shocker -- they became fat and diabetic (control animals on the same high-fat diet did not), suggesting that Enterobacter helped cause obesity. As it turns out, the bug triggers chronic low-grade inflammation, which leads to insulin resistance and weight gain. The patient lost 113 pounds in 23 weeks on a diet of whole grains and \"prebiotics\" -- nondigestible high-fiber foods (examples include garlic, onions, chicory root, dandelion greens and asparagus) that feed friendly bacteria, like the Bifidobacterium in your yogurt, and starve the bad. (Within weeks, the Enterobacter was completely wiped out.)","\"You Really Love A Smooth Grenache\"","Good news here if you think dandelion greens are more compelling when paired with a strong drink. A study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that red wine's polyphenols -- those compounds whose heart-healthy benefits you've heard so much about -- also have prebiotic potential. Just one glass (9 ounces) of red wine daily for a month meaningfully boosted drinkers' ratios of good-to-bad gut bacteria (compared with alcohol-free and polyphenol-free gin-drinking controls). A caveat: The benefit doesn't apply to sweet dessert wines, which presumably feed the wrong microbiota.","\"Sorry, You Have A High-Steak Problem\"","Now consider pairing that grenache with something other than short ribs. The problem here is that certain red-meat-loving gut bacteria increase your heart attack risk, found a study at the Cleveland Clinic. When microbes digest compounds in meat called carnitine and lecithin, the liver uses the byproduct to make an artery-hardener that may be even more of a culprit in heart disease than cholesterol: trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Note: Only if you have bacteria in your gut that are accustomed to meat -- vegans don't -- could you churn out TMAO. (But burger lovers, be heartened: Scientists are working on ways to identify and eventually target the villain bacteria.)"],"targetTitle":"What Your Gut Bacteria Say About You","targetDescription":"The 100 trillion microbes that live in your gut know -- and influence -- you from the inside out.

{"postId":"53dovb","postText":["What It Feels Like to Die"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["\"Do you want to know what will happen as your body starts shutting down?\" My mother and I sat across from the hospice nurse in my parents\u2019 Colorado home. It was 2005, and my mother had reached the end of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. A month or two earlier, she\u2019d been able to take the dog for daily walks in the mountains and travel to Australia with my father. Now, she was weak, exhausted from the disease and chemotherapy and pain medication. My mother had been the one to decide, with her doctor\u2019s blessing, to stop pursuing the dwindling chemo options, and she had been the one to ask her doctor to call hospice. Still, we weren\u2019t prepared for the nurse\u2019s question. My mother and I exchanged glances, a little shocked. But what we felt most was a sense of relief. During six-and-a-half years of treatment, although my mother saw two general practitioners, six oncologists, a cardiologist, several radiation technicians, nurses at two chemotherapy facilities, and surgeons at three different clinics\u2014not once, to my knowledge, had anyone talked to her about what would happen as she died.","There\u2019s good reason. \"Roughly from the last two weeks until the last breath, somewhere in that interval, people become too sick, or too drowsy, or too unconscious, to tell us what they\u2019re experiencing,\" says Margaret Campbell, a professor of nursing at Wayne State University who has worked in palliative care for decades. The way death is talked about tends to be based on what family, friends, and medical professionals see, rather than accounts of what dying actually feels like. James Hallenbeck, a palliative-care specialist at Stanford University, often compares dying to black holes. \"We can see the effect of black holes, but it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to look inside them. They exert an increasingly strong gravitational pull the closer one gets to them. As one passes the \u2018event horizon,\u2019 apparently the laws of physics begin to change.\" What does dying feel like? Despite a growing body of research about death, the actual, physical experience of dying\u2014the last few days or moments\u2014remains shrouded in mystery. Medicine is just beginning to peek beyond the horizon. * * * Until about 100 years ago, almost all dying happened quickly. But modern medicine has radically changed how long the end of life can be stretched. Now, Americans who have access to medical care often die gradually, of lingering diseases like most terminal cancers or complications from diabetes or dementia, rather than quickly from, say, a farm accident or the flu. According to the Centers for Disease Control\u2019s most recent figures, Americans are most likely to die of heart disease, cancer, or chronic pulmonary lung disease. \"Pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness.\" For those who do die gradually, there\u2019s often a final, rapid slide that happens in roughly the last few days of life\u2014a phase known as \"active dying.\" During this time, Hallenbeck writes in Palliative Care Perspectives, his guide to palliative care for physicians, people tend to lose their senses and desires in a certain order. \"First hunger and then thirst are lost. Speech is lost next, followed by vision. The last senses to go are usually hearing and touch.\"","Whether dying is physically painful, or how painful it is, appears to vary. \"There are some kinds of conditions where pain is inevitable,\" Campbell says. \"There are some patients that just get really, really old and just fade away, and there\u2019s no distress.\" Having a disease associated with pain doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll necessarily endure a difficult death, either. Most people dying of cancer need pain medication to keep them comfortable, Campbell notes\u2014and the medicine usually works. \"If they\u2019re getting a good, comprehensive pain regimen, they can die peacefully,\" she says. When people become too weak to cough or swallow, some start to make a noise in the backs of their throats. The sound can be deeply disturbing, as if the patient is suffering. But that\u2019s not what it feels like to the person dying, as far as doctors can tell. In fact, medical researchers believe that the phenomenon\u2014which is commonly called a death rattle\u2014probably doesn\u2019t hurt. Ultimately, because most people lose awareness or consciousness in their last few hours or days, it\u2019s hard to know for certain how much patients are suffering. \"We generally believe that if your brain is really in a comatose kind of situation, or you\u2019re not really responsive, that your perception\u2014how you feel about things\u2014may also be significantly decreased,\" says David Hui, an oncologist and palliative-care specialist who researches the signs of approaching death. \"You may or may not even be aware of what\u2019s happening.\"","* * * A week or two after we spoke to the nurse, my mother sank into a state where she was rarely conscious. When she was awake, it was only the most basic part of her that was there: the part that told her legs to move to get her to the bathroom, the automated steps in brushing her teeth and then wiping the sink afterward. Her mind turned away from her children and husband for the first time. I wanted to know what she was thinking about. I wanted to know where her mind was. Being at the bedside of an unresponsive dying person can feel like trying to find out whether someone is home by looking through thick-curtained windows. Is the person sleeping, dreaming, experiencing something supernatural? Is her mind gone? For many dying people, \"the brain does the same thing that the body does in that it starts to sacrifice areas which are less critical to survival,\" says David Hovda, director of the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center. He compares the breakdown to what happens in aging: People tend to lose their abilities for complex or executive planning, learning motor skills\u2014and, in what turns out to be a very important function, inhibition. \"The waves get higher and higher, and eventually, they carry the person out to sea.\" \"As the brain begins to change and start to die, different parts become excited, and one of the parts that becomes excited is the visual system,\" Hovda explains. \"And so that\u2019s where people begin to see light.\"","Recent research points to evidence that the sharpening of the senses some people report also seems to match what we know about the brain\u2019s response to dying. Jimo Borjigin, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, first became intrigued by this subject when she noticed something strange in the brains of animals in another experiment: Just before the animals died, neurochemicals in the brain suddenly surged. While scientists had known that brain neurons continued to fire after a person died, this was different. The neurons were secreting new chemicals, and in large amounts. \"A lot of cardiac-arrest survivors describe that during their unconscious period, they have this amazing experience in their brain,\" she says. \"They see lights and then they describe the experience as \u2018realer than real.\u2019\" She realized the sudden release of neurochemicals might help to explain this feeling. Borjigin and her research team tried an experiment. They anesthetized eight rats, and then stopped their hearts. \"Suddenly, all the different regions of the brain became synchronized,\" she says. The rats\u2019 brains showed higher power in different frequency waves, and also what is known as coherence\u2014the electrical activity from different parts of the brain working together. \"If you\u2019re focusing attention, doing something, trying to figure out a word or trying to remember a face\u2014when you\u2019re doing high-level cognitive activity, these features go up,\" Borjigin says. \"These are well-used parameters in studying human consciousness in awake humans. So, we thought, if you\u2019re alert or aroused, similar parameters should also go up in the dying brain. In fact, that was the case.\"","* * * In her last couple of weeks, when my mother\u2019s mind seemed to be floating off somewhere else most of the time, she would sometimes lift her arms into the air, plucking at invisible objects with her fingers. Once, I captured her hands in mine and asked what she\u2019d been doing. \"Putting things away,\" she answered, smiling dreamily. This half-dreaming, half-waking state is common in dying people. In fact, researchers led by Christopher Kerr at a hospice center outside Buffalo, New York, conducted a study of dying people\u2019s dreams. Most of the patients interviewed, 88 percent, had at least one dream or vision. And those dreams usually felt different to them from normal dreams. For one thing, the dreams seemed clearer, more real. The \"patients\u2019 pre-death dreams were frequently so intense that the dream carried into wakefulness and the dying often experienced them as waking reality,\" the researchers write in the Journal of Palliative Medicine. Seventy-two percent of the patients dreamed about reuniting with people who had already died. Fifty-nine percent said they dreamed about getting ready to travel somewhere.

I see it from the perspective of the dog. It\u2019s the right thing to do.\"","Nvidia\u2019s puppy love began informally several years ago, when one worker asked Huang if he could bring his dog to work. Sure, the CEO said: \"I used to have a dog myself. I\u2019d go home from work to see the dog during lunch.\"","More dog owners started bringing their pets, and the company adopted a formal policy. Dogs have to be leashed while on campus, and attended by their owner. They aren\u2019t allowed near food areas, for sanitary reasons. If a meeting is on the schedule, the owner has to get a co-worker to keep an eye on the dog. In some cases, dog owners have been relocated to accommodate a neighbor with an allergy or other aversion to dogs.","Since the Silicon Valley tech company occupies a sprawling, low-rise campus, there\u2019s plenty of outdoor space for letting the dogs out, as evident in the video above. The company provides poop bags, but no staff to handle the chore; owners must clean up after their own dogs.","As our cameras rolled, several dogs frolicked in the grass, each seemingly comfortable with the others. Dog feuds are rare, Nvidia employees told us. Most dogs adjust quickly to the new digs once they start coming to work, and owners bring beds or blankets to cozy up on the floors of their cubicles, where dogs loll much of the day. Naps are often interrupted by co-workers or visitors who want to play.","A few other companies allow dogs, including Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Salesforce (CRM), hotel chain Kimpton and candy company Mars. (About 7% of US employers allow pets in the workplace, according to the Society of Human Resource Management.) The perk saves owners the expense of paying for a dog walker at home. Some managers say pets promote collegiality in the office, and even help reduce employee stress. Nervous about your deadline? Here, pet this.","Cats, alas, are not welcome at Nvidia, or any other company we\u2019re aware of, because they\u2019re less comfortable in unfamiliar places\u2014and they occasionally provoke the dogs. Besides, the cat probably enjoys the solitude when the dog\u2014and its owner\u2014go to work.","Rick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

The answer is obvious."],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Last summer, a black real estate developer and reality television show host \u2014 let\u2019s call him Donell Trump \u2014 announced his candidacy for president of the United States. A notorious adulterer, Donell Trump has fathered five children with three different wives. Over decades in the media spotlight, he has insulted a slew of women by calling them, among many other slurs, \"fat,\" \"ugly\" and \"pigs\"; he told one female journalist she had \"the face of a dog.\"","Once the proprietor of a global beauty pageant, whose contestants he routinely demeaned, Donell Trump is obsessed with boasting about his sexual prowess. He joked about the size of his anatomy during a live televised debate and riffed about dating his adult daughter. If Donell Trump\u2019s attitude toward the fairer sex could be distilled into a single sentence, it\u2019s what he told Esquire in 1991: \"It really doesn\u2019t matter what [the media] write about you as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\"","Then there\u2019s money. Donell Trump can\u2019t get enough of it. He\u2019s obsessed with ostentatious displays of wealth. Donell Trump constantly exaggerates his personal net worth, and his larger-than-life existence \u2014 shiny watches, fast cars, big yachts, massive cribs \u2014 resembles that of a rap star. A substantial part of his fortune was made through shady business ventures that took advantage of working-class people, but Donell Trump has no apologies.","Donell Trump also displays rank ignorance about every single political issue he\u2019s asked about, speaks at a fifth-grade reading level, and has trouble forming grammatically correct sentences. He routinely nudges attendees at his rallies to beat up protestors, has boasted that he could shoot someone on Manhattan\u2019s 5th Avenue to prove his voters\u2019 loyalty to him, and has dropped hints that his supporters should kill his opponent.","Presented with such a presidential candidate \u2014 one who seemingly went out of his way to personify every negative stereotype our society holds about black male sexuality, avarice and propensity to violence \u2014 how would the Republican Party base and conservative entertainment industry respond? Would Bill O\u2019Reilly and Jerry Falwell Jr. praise Donell Trump as a model American businessman and moral leader? Or would they lament how this habitual homewrecker and \"baby daddy\" to three separate women symbolized the epidemic of African American absentee fatherhood? Would Rush Limbaugh insist that Donell Trump\u2019s half-literate tirades were the heartfelt pleas of a down-to-earth, blue-collar billionaire? Or instead treat his listeners to a rant about the inanities of Ebonics?","\" A racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. f t","In a sense, we already know how this segment of the right would respond to such a hypothetical black politician, given the way they've treated President Obama. An intellectual, Ivy League-educated, cool-tempered family man, Obama has nevertheless been portrayed by much of the right-wing media as nothing short of the anti-Christ, a crypto-Muslim Manchurian candidate secretly plotting to destroy America. Meanwhile, many of the same people who claim with a straight face that the plagiarizing former nude model Melania Trump would make an ideal first lady slam Michelle Obama\u2019s innocuous healthy-eating initiative as nothing less than a Maoist reeducation scheme.","Granted, if conservatives rejected Donell Trump as unfit for office, they wouldn\u2019t be in the wrong. The values Donell Trump exemplifies \u2014 pride, greed, envy, a literal catalog of the seven deadly sins \u2014 are ones we ought to recoil from when choosing a president.","My point is that the very voters and media personalities who would almost certainly condemn Donell have embraced Donald, which indicates the degree to which a racial double standard exists at the core of the Republican Party and conservative media world. Replace the outer-borough white ethnic vulgarity with African American ghetto vernacular and they\u2019d call the man a \"thug.\"","Some conservatives may respond to this thought exercise by claiming that, actually, Republican voters would enthusiastically welcome a black candidate, a Donell Trump \u2014 so long as he, too, championed nationalist, politically incorrect, anti-immigrant populism. But the closest the GOP ever had to a black Trump, 2012 contender Herman Cain, fizzled out as soon as sexual harassment allegations against him became public.","Moreover, so much of Donald Trump\u2019s popularity is based on unsubtle appeals to white nationalism that \u2014 despite the thought exercise above \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to imagine a true black analogue. Trump\u2019s hesitance to condemn David Duke, his \"law and order\" mantra evocative of Richard Nixon\u2019s Southern strategy, and his conspiracy theories about the president\u2019s birth certificate are all intended to whip up white racial resentment.","Which brings us to the crux of the matter: Whether the subject is poverty, police brutality or affirmative action, conservatives are loath to acknowledge the presence of racism in American society. Yet it\u2019s far from hidden; it courses through the presidential campaign, as the notion of a Donell Trump candidacy clearly shows.","James Kirchick is a fellow with the Foreign Policy Initiative.

Now, the part-time model is taking legal action.","Late last week, Avalos and an unspecified group of other plaintiffs who say their photos were used to make phony accounts filed a $1.5 billion class-action suit against Match.com\u2019s parent company, IAC (InterActiveCorp), in Manhattan federal court, according to the Post.","Avalos told The New York Daily News these phony profiles allegedly led to tragedy for one Match.com user.

Still, it would be remiss of us not to point out how big the Chilis\u2019 crowd is tonight: it feels twice as large as Biffy\u2019s or Disclosure\u2019s.The frontman doesn\u2019t say much tonight - Flea, as usual, does most of the talking - but when he does open his mouth, it\u2019s to share this nugget of wisdom with us: \"All these firefighters and they don't know how to put out a flare\/ Shit, it's hard to breathe, might set fire to your pubic hair\/ I might have to do a WWE into that table full of drinks down there.\" Um, thanks for that, Anthony.","The Red Hot Chili Peppers\u2019 drummer is a 54 year-old man who\u2019s never worn a baseball cap the right way round, and he remains this band\u2019s resident badass. There\u2019s no way any group featuring this guy is the worst one in the universe.","It\u2019s a Red Hot Chili Peppers show; you make allowances for gratuitous slap bass. At times, however, it feels like every spare moment is filled with Flea\u2019s fiddling, and it never fails to grate on your nerves. A useful gauge during these moments is to look around and see who looks like they\u2019re having more fun, him or the crowd. Guess what the answer is.Of the many, many former members of RHCP, you could argue that ex-guitarist John Frusciante was \u2013 even more so than founding member Hillel Slovak \u2013 the only irreplaceable one. Yet Josh Klinghoffer, the man tasked with filling Frusciante\u2019s shoes, is proving a more than capable substitute. Frusciante is still missed \u2013 Keidis recently said of him that, \"Never did I meet someone who was so easy to write songs with\" \u2013 but Klinghoffer is making the role his own.","The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been together for over thirty years, and the fact that they haven\u2019t completely succumbed to the power of nostalgia is admirable. Even so, it\u2019s fair to say that songs like \u2018Dark Necessities\u2019 and \u2019Go Robot\u2019 - both taken from the band\u2019s new album, \u2018The Getaway\u2019 - are tolerated, rather than celebrated, tonight.","Say what you will about the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but any band packing a tune as glorious as \u2018Under The Bridge\u2019 don\u2019t deserve the scorn of Fox News. You might have heard their signature track a thousand times before, but it never sounds overplayed \u2013 unlike, say, set-closer \u2018Give It Away\u2019.","Look, it\u2019s no small thing to be the worst band in the universe. This is a universe, after all, in which Nickelback, Limp Bizkit and The Pigeon Detectives all exist on the same planet. And even if you truly can\u2019t stand the Red Hot Chili Peppers, you\u2019d still have a hard time arguing they were even the worst band on this stage \u2013 not when Imagine Dragons were the most recent occupants of it."],"targetTitle":"Red Hot Chili Peppers' Leeds Headline Set Reviewed","targetDescription":"GIPHY is your top source for the best & newest GIFs & Animated Stickers online.

Most of Obama\u2019s senior staffers \u2014 such as former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and former economic adviser Lawrence Summers \u2014 were men who\u2019d worked on his campaign and subsequently filled his cabinet.","\"If you didn\u2019t come in from the campaign, it was a tough circle to break into,\" Anita Dunn, who served as White House communications director until November 2009, told the Washington Post. \"Given the makeup of the campaign, there were just more men than women.\"","Susan Rice, who\u2019s currently the national security adviser, said she (and other women) had to shoulder their way into important conversations: \"It\u2019s not pleasant to have to appeal to a man to say, \u2018Include me in that meeting.\u2019\"","And even when they\u2019d made it into the room, female staffers were sometimes overlooked.

But there\u2019s more.","A detailed teardown (via PopMech) of a pair of Beats\u2019 immensely popular Solo headphones conducted by hardware-focused venture capital firm Bolt has some answers buried beneath. The headphones are incredibly cheaply made. The company cuts corners everywhere it can; gluing pieces together instead of using screws, and reducing the amount of tooling wherever possible. Amazingly, for all the company\u2019s claims about precision sound design, the headphones use freaking off-the-shelf drivers!","None of this is all that surprising because Beats are, after all, terrible and fragile. The crazy part is that the headphones are so cheap that Beats actually needs to add weight to make them feel heftier. From the Medium post:","One of the great things about the solo headphones is how substantial they feel. A little bit of weight makes the product feel solid, durable, and valuable. One way to do this cheaply is to make some components out of metal in order to add weight. In these headphones, 30% of the weight comes from four tiny metal parts that are there for the sole purpose of adding weight.","Here is an image illustrating this point:","On the left, all of the components that actually do something.

All the same, much of Trump\u2019s rhetoric could have the effect of bringing his viewers\u2019 omnipresent fear of death closer to their conscious minds, according to Sheldon Solomon, a psychologist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.","That includes his emphasis on terrorism, unsurprisingly, but also his preoccupation with immigration. This focus might be helping Trump, since Solomon\u2019s recent research shows that people who are thinking about death are more likely to say they support him. Study subjects who were prompted to talk about their own death later rated their support for Trump 1.66 points higher on a five-point scale than those who were prompted to talk about pain generally.","\"I\u2019m not suggesting that any of this is calculated, but almost everything that he does is demonstrably effective for raising these non-conscious, existential concerns that in turn make his kind of candidacy all the more alluring,\" Solomon said.","Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior.

Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book \" Solomon is part of a group of researchers that has spent decades investigating the connections between death and a broad variety of human beliefs and behavior. Their inspiration has been the work of Ernest Becker, an anthropologist who argued that the fear of death was a kind of fundamental principle in explaining human psychology. Becker won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1973 book \" The Denial of Death ,\" but he was shunned in the academic community for what his peers saw as a lack of rigor.","\"It was existential, psychodynamic, philosophical speculation for which there was no empirical proof,\" Solomon said. He and his colleagues have tried to supply that proof through experimentation.","Their research is still preliminary and controversial, and they haven\u2019t worked out a complete theory, but they have discovered a number of startling facts about how people think about death.","For example, Solomon and Florette Cohen of the City University of New York, College of Staten Island recently found evidence that asking people to think about immigrants also gets them thinking about death.","Solomon and Cohen asked a small group of volunteers at the College of Staten Island to respond to one of three prompts. One group was asked to write down what they thought would happen, in as much detail as possible, if immigrants moved into their neighborhoods, and what emotions they would feel. The other two groups were asked to answer the same questions, but about their own deaths and about feeling intense pain instead of about immigration.","Then the two researchers gave the participants a set of words with letters missing and asked them to fill in the blanks to get an idea of what the participants were thinking about. Shown \"C O F F _ _,\" for example, many people might write \"COFFEE,\" especially students in college. If they were thinking about death, however, they might write \"COFFIN\" instead.","The participants who had been asked to think about immigration had death on their minds, too \u2014 almost to the same extent as those who had been asked to think about death explicitly.","Assigned scores from zero to one based on how many words related to death they produced, those who had been asked to think about immigration scored 0.92 on average, while those who had been asked to think about death scored 0.96. Those asked to think about pain scored just 0.19. There was no evidence that the effect was greater for conservative participants in the study.","Solomon said he hopes to replicate the study, which was completed with a small group of a few dozen students at the College of Staten Island.","Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. Yet the results accord with those of similar studies that suggest people interpret challenges to their culture as threats to their very existence. A different group of researchers found that after a group of Canadians read an article in which Canadian cultural tropes were mocked, they were thinking about death, too.","The pattern extends to religious beliefs. The pattern extends to religious beliefs. Another study found a comparable effect in atheists confronted with arguments in favor of intelligent design, and a third concluded that pointing out logical inconsistencies in the Bible made thoughts of death also more accessible to fundamentalist Christians.","For Solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives \u2014 whether through religion, nationality or \"staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some Cheez Whiz on a cracker,\" in Solomon\u2019s words \u2014 they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. He and his colleagues For Solomon, the research suggests that when people create meaning in their lives \u2014 whether through religion, nationality or \"staying at home with a 30-pack of beer and spraying some Cheez Whiz on a cracker,\" in Solomon\u2019s words \u2014 they are protecting themselves from their constant awareness of death. He and his colleagues have argued that the same is true of clothing and grooming, and that humans conceal their nature as animals from themselves to avoid thinking about their mortality.","Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They Solomon and his colleagues also have found that thinking about death makes charismatic, resolute leaders more appealing. They showed that to be true during President George W. Bush\u2019s successful campaign for reelection against John F. Kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004, and Solomon\u2019s new research with Cohen has produced similar results for Trump.","They rated participants\u2019 support for Trump on a scale out of five points based on their answers to several questions. The average rating for those who had been reminded of their mortality was 3.8 points, but it was just 2.2 points for those who had been asked to think about pain.","Solomon said these results suggest that the fear of death is one of several interrelated psychological concepts that could help explain why Trump has been so successful, including authoritarianism, an aversion to uncertainty and racial prejudice.","\"It sure seems like an existentially shaky historical moment where it has become increasingly difficult for the average American to perceive that they have any basis for either meaning or self-worth,\" Solomon said. \"It is a factor, and in a very close election, it could matter.\""],"targetTitle":"This might be the darkest theory yet about why Donald Trump keeps

{"postId":"4z1oa2","postText":["Ex-Cons Remember Their Worst Jobs After Being Released from Prison"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Getting a job when you first get out of prison can be a nightmare . Most employers refuse to hire someone fresh out the feds or convicts who are still incarcerated but allowed to get a job through \"work-release.\" Other prisoners are so shell-shocked from being back in a society that changed dramatically while they were locked up, that figuring out how to do basic things like use public transportation or a cell phone can feel like a Herculean task. According to the National Institute of Justice , over 60 percent of ex-cons are jobless up to a year after release.","That said, getting a job is a necessary step for prisoners to integrate back into society. Often times, it's a requirement by the criminal justice system, or else freshly-released inmates will risk being sent back to the feds. But even when ex-cons do manage to get hired, the work is underpaid, demoralizing, and their employers don't do much to encourage the re-entry process. There are organizers that help former prisoners assimilate into the workforce, but the support is generally few and far between.","After serving 23 years in the feds, the first job I got on the outside was as a saute\u0301 cook at an Italian restaurant, despite my earning two college degrees while in prison. The work sucked, and I was forced to do the grunt work no one else would do, like clean out the fryers every night. I wasn't in any position to argue and risk being canned, and my employers took advantage of this. I dreaded that job, but as I've talked with other ex-cons over the years about their first gigs on the outside, I now consider myself lucky. The fact that over 75 percent of ex-cons are rearrested within five years of releas e should be no surprise when the only jobs offered to people with criminal records are the gigs no one else applies for. VICE chatted with three ex-cons to get more perspective on what re-entering the workforce was like once they got out of prison.","Image of cattle ranchers via Wikimedia Creative Commons","Mendoor Smith, 43-Year-Old from Iowa","Served 12 Years for Marijuana Possession","Released from Custody in 2013","The worst job I had was working on a cattle ranch as a utility farmer, making $8.25 an hour. I had to be there from about 6 AM to 5 PM every day, and the commute was 45 minutes from the halfway house I was placed in. It wasn't really tough work, but the handling of manure and animals was rough, as was taking care of the calves and cows. Dealing with cows everyday is messy, and I'd have to clean out their living pens.","I remember calving one shift during the winter, and when I did my hourly inspection of the herd, I noticed a cow with an extremely bad vaginal prolapse. I called my boss and he called the vet who came out at four in the morning. I had to lift the cow's vaginal insides and hold them while the vet tried to stuff them back inside the cow. After about an hour and a half of lifting and stuffing this slimy, nasty thing, the vet finally got it all back inside and sewed up. When I did my final inspection of the morning at 10 AM, the cow had died. All that work was for nothing. Having to stick my entire arm in a cow to help pull out a calf was not fun either. You work super hard to pull one of the slimy things out, and then you have to scoop the little thing up and take off before the cow attacks you for holding its calf. Having a 1,200 pound animal chase you is a little intimidating.","I had two coworkers that knew about my [criminal] situation. They asked a lot of questions, stuff about what was prison like and what I did to get all that time. My boss was a good boss. He helped me get my Class A driver's license so I could drive trucks for him. He was a big help and was instrumental in me getting the job I have now. The farm was a tight-knit family, so I was treated well, but the work was completely horrible. It prepared me for the struggle of rebuilding my life after prison, though. It didn't kill me and it made me stronger. That job sucked, but I was still glad to have it because I wouldn't be in the position I'm in today otherwise.","David Hibdon, 55-Year-Old from Missouri","Served 10 Years for Drug Conspiracy","Released from Custody in 2014","My first job out of prison was the worst job available in Colombia, Missouri. I was picking up trash at the city dump in 100-plus degree weather for $8 an hour. I had to walk around 27 acres and pick up the trash that blew off the trucks, rain or shine. Some days I walked through raw sewage, or mud up to my ankles. The halfway house didn't provide transportation to the job, and I had to walk there every morning. It was a seven mile walk that took over two hours. I had to be there at seven in the morning and got off at 4 PM, with only a short lunch break in between. With my first paycheck, I bought a bike and then it only took me forty minutes to get to work. I was making about 50 bucks a day, but I was required to give 25 percent to the halfway house. If I bought a soda or cigarettes I was almost broke. It took me two months in the halfway house to save up and buy a $500 car.","I worked there because it was the only job available. Nobody wanted the job because of the stink and the dust blowing on you from the trash trucks. No one else would take these jobs besides ex-cons at the halfway house. And all the other ex-cons that worked there would sleep on a nearby hill or smoke K2 all day while I was working. I was alienated out there. It was one of the most degrading experiences I ever went through, but I got past it. It sure didn't help me become a better person cause I was still the same after.","I've had four jobs since I've been out, and I never told anyone I was on parole until after I was hired, or they wouldn't have hired me. I eventually started my own business, subcontracting myself out to do maintenance on rental properties. I could go back to the dump if I wanted, but that job sucked.","Image of a telemarketing call center via","Mike Vargas, 44-Year-Old from Washington DC","Served 14 Years for a Drug Conspiracy","Released from Custody in 2009","It wasn't hard getting a job when I came home, it just wasn't a good job. I started working the same week I was released at this telemarketing place that hired ex-cons at $7.25 an hour. You had to be there talking to people on the phone all day, cold calling, trying to collect donations for different organizations around the state and country. It was cool at first, but after a while I was starting to feel like a robot.","I worked with mostly young people, and there were also a bunch of ex-cons working there. Anybody could have got hired at this place, but the conditions were terrible. You had a total of 16 minutes of break time for a full eight hour shift. If you went to get a Coke, you had to clock out. If you went to the bathroom, you had to clock out. If you didn't kiss ass, you were an outsider. There was a lot of favoritism, and also a big turnover within staff, of course.","Dudes would curse out the boss. One dude even jumped up, picked up a computer, and slammed it down because he couldn't get anybody to donate. He walked out shortly after. But most ex-cons needed the job to get out of the halfway house, so they just kept working there until something better came along. I quit that job when I had something better lined up.

The decision upheld the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) regulation that supports net neutrality.","Net neutrality means that the Internet service providers or broadband carriers treat all data that travels over their networks in exactly the same way, much like our telephone service and power are regulated. It\u2019s the way the Internet has worked since its inception and we know how the Internet has transformed our lives in nearly everything we do. It\u2019s also spawned innovation and many new companies to create products and services we never imagined.","But for many years, there has been an effort to change all this, led by the broadband carriers Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T. They've wanted to offer different classes of Internet services, one that provides faster speeds and better access to those websites that pay, and a slower access speed for those that don't want to pay.","It was a way for these companies with with limited competition to generate more revenue, but it would also mean that the bigger companies that could pay more for faster service would receive preferential treatment for their content, compared to smaller startup companies that could not afford to pay.","Three years ago when these rules were being formulated by the FCC, a groundswell of users spoke up in support of net neutrality, more than any other regulation in recent history. Four million citizens emailed and called the FCC objecting to any changes away from net neutrality. When comedian John Oliver explained on HBO\u2019s \"Last Week Tonight\" what was being proposed that might compromise net neutrality, it generated 45,000 responses to the agency in just a few minutes.","Opposition also came from the major technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix. The Internet Association , the organization representing nearly 40 tech companies, including those above, also filed a formal petition in opposition. They want companies to compete by being able to attract customers based on their products and services, not on speed of access.","Next Page: How the citizens beat the lobbyists, and what this decision

Not much has been revealed about the next film in the historic franchise, but it seems a leak of the potential title has given us plenty of cause for speculation. In a video that seems to show some kind of Star Wars celebration, an apparent poster depicts Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.","Episode VIII to have the title Fall of the Resistance.","If this is truly the title, we will definitely be in for an interesting storyline. However, I don't think this is the new movie's name, but merely a working title that the production staff are using while on set.","Indeed, Star Wars has a long history of doing this. Check out some of the working titles the franchise has utilized over the years.","Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace","Ahh, Episode I, how hyped you were. But that is beside the point. While the title The Phantom Menace had many fans wishing they could forget, that was not always the title that was used on set. The original was Episode I: The Beginning. Pretty fitting, since it really is the beginning story of the world that we know and love. Personally, I liked this title much more than The Phantom Menace and I think they should have stuck with it.","Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack Of The Clones","This is when things started to get a bit better with the prequels. Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones brought us the lovable Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi, but also brought us one of the most hated characters ever in Jar Jar Binks. And this is pretty ironic, considering the working title for Episode II was Episode II: Jar Jar's Big\/Great Adventure. Could you imagine if Lucasfilm actually ran with this? The backlash would have been insurmountable and I don't think it would have every recovered from that. #HailJarJar!","Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return Of The Jedi","Highly regarded as one of the best films of all time, Star Wars: Episode VI \u2013 Return of the Jedi is a pop culture classic. It was so popular that Family Guy titled the first part of its Star Wars trilogy after Episode VI's working title. Of course, I am referring to the infamous Blue Harvest, which was the name that was used during production of Return of the Jedi \u2014 and a name that will always be etched in the minds of Star Wars fanatics everywhere.","Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens","The Force Awakens was easily one of the most anticipated films of ALL TIME. Unfortunately, the working title was not as fun as its previous counterparts. It was titled after J.J. Abrams' production company and was referred to as Episode VII: Foodles. A bit adolescent I know, but fun and entertaining, nonetheless.","Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 Fall Of The Resistance (Possibly)","The apparent leaked title of the next installment is Fall of the Resistance. Whether this is the actual title or a working title is a mystery in itself, but Episode VIII already has a working title, according to Carrie Fisher \u2014 Space Bear: Episode VIII. No, this is not a joke. Fisher tweeted out a photo of her adorable dog sitting on a chair with this supposed headline.","Pretty adorable, and the whole crew seems to really be having a great time working on Episode VIII. #SpaceBear2017!","So What Is Your Favorite Star Wars Working Title?","With each Star Wars temporary name, there are some funny ones and definitely some weird ones. Each one is unique and shows just how fascinating it must be to be a part of the on-set moviemaking magic."],"targetTitle":"'Star Wars: Episode 8' Working Title May Have Been Leaked","targetDescription":"The first big bit of information regarding Star Wars: Episode VIII has slipped onto the internet!

The leading explanation for the moon's origin, known as the giant impact hypothesis, suggests that the moon resulted from the collision of two protoplanets, or embryonic worlds. One of those was the young Earth, and the other was a potentially Mars-size object called Theia. The moon then coalesced from the rubble. [How Earth's Moon Was Made (A Photo Timeline)]","\"By understanding the moon, we can tell the story of the early bombardment of Earth,\" study lead author William Bottke, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, told Space.com.","However, the precise timeline of this giant impact event is under dispute. The ages of the most ancient lunar samples the Apollo astronauts brought back are still debated, since these samples have typically been battered and heated by subsequent cosmic impacts.","\"To understand the formation and evolution of our world as well as those in the inner solar system, we need to understand the timing of major events during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said.","To find out more about this giant impact, scientists developed a computer model of the event. They found that the impact not only created a disk of debris near Earth that formed the moon, but it also ejected huge amounts of rubble \u2014 as much as several percent of Earth's mass \u2014 away from Earth and the moon.","The simulations found that numerous fragments from the moon-forming impact \u2014 hundreds of millions of which were at least a mile (1.6 kilometers) long \u2014 blasted the asteroid belt, striking asteroids there at speeds of more than 22,370 mph (36,000 km\/h), more than twice as fast as typical crashes in the belt. These collisions from the moon-forming impact would have generated superheated material, the researchers said.","\"In an explosion, there is often collateral damage, where nearby buildings and innocent bystanders are affected,\" Bottke said. \"Investigators can learn about the explosive device and the explosion itself by studying what happened to people, infrastructure, and whether trace amounts of the explosive device can be found among the blast damage. Here, the 'innocent bystanders' were the main-belt asteroids.\"","Collisions against these asteroids in more recent times returned these remnants to Earth in stony meteorites, which the scientists now have analyzed and used to date the age of the impact.","\"In a sense, the asteroid belt has been an eyewitness to multiple 'drive-by shootings' from the earliest time in solar system history,\" Bottke said. \"By reading the traces left behind, we can use asteroid samples to tell us who did it, when they did it and how they did it.\"","The researchers deduced that the moon-forming impact occurred about 4.47 billion years ago, in agreement with many previous estimates.","\"We can now use asteroids, for the first time, to tell us about many of the major events that took place in the inner solar system during the planet-formation era,\" Bottke said. \"This gives us a new window on a time period which has been virtually unknown up to now.\"","This research \"raises the intriguing possibility that trace amounts of the primordial Earth or moon-forming impactor called Theia may still be found on asteroids today, or possibly within some of our meteorites,\" Bottke said. \"It may be simply a matter of looking and asking the right questions. Finding these materials would be one of the Holy Grails of geology \u2014 we have no rocks older than 4 billion years old on Earth, and no one knows the exact nature of the original building blocks of our planet.\"","If future research can uncover examples of this impact in asteroid samples, \"possibly by getting them from an asteroid sample return mission like OSIRIS-REx, we would have one of the key pieces of the puzzle explaining why our world is the way it is, and what has changed since its infancy,\" Bottke said.","The scientists detailed their findings in the April 17 issue of the journal Science."],"targetTitle":"We've finally figured out when the moon formed","targetDescription":"It involves a duck.

Per The Independent, the measure is also expected to save money by cutting back on the 30,000 marijuana-related cases courts have had to handle each year. It will also free up police resources to pursue larger drug trafficking incidents.","But \"decriminalized\" is not the same as \"legal,\" as a Swiss Broadcasting Corporation report makes clear.

The carrots are also bleached to make them look more bright and attractive. Carrots destined to be baby carrots are often not properly irrigated so they take on a white blush which is not attractive. Chlorine gets rid of this and makes the baby carrots look pretty again.","So what\u2019s the option.

{"postId":"380112609607155712","postText":["The iPhone 5C number Apple doesn't want you to know"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["On Monday, Apple managed to make a bit of news by not announcing any. For the first time, the iPhone maker didn't reveal how many preorders were made on its new line of smartphones. The silence on orders for the iPhone 5C -- a week after it was announced -- has investors down on the tech giant.","Since 2010, Apple's media blitz for its new iPhone has gone like this: On a Friday following the big unveil event, people can begin preordering the new phone, The Verge points out. A few days later, Apple trumpets the high number of new iPhones the public wants. In 2010, more than 600,000 iPhone 4s were preordered in 24 hours. By the time the iPhone 5 was released two years later, that preorder figure was 2 million.","By creating the perception of scarcity, Apple's tactic worked to get some consumers off the fence about buying a new iPhone. But this year, Apple was mum about preorder numbers several days after iPhone 5C preorders went live. This didn't go unnoticed by Wall Street. With investors interpreting Apple's silence as weak initial 5C sales, Apple's stock slid to $450 on Monday from Friday's close of $465.","But circumstances may be a bit different this year. For one, Apple's top-line phone, the iPhone 5S, can't be preordered. If you want it the first day it's on sale, you have to wait in line -- creating yet another organic marketing tool for Apple. The company's top-line phone, with the new features like the fingerprint reader and desktop-like performance, should be the one with higher sales. As many others have pointed out, the iPhone 5C is essentially a rebranded iPhone 5 with nearly all the same specs. John Gruber, a well-regarded Apple observer, thinks it's a clever marketing move for Apple's second-tier phone:","It\u2019s just that instead of putting the year-old iPhone 5 in slot #2, they\u2019ve created the 5C to debut in that slot. The 5C is, effectively, an iPhone 5. Same A6, same camera, same just about everything \u2014 except for the most obvious difference, its array of colorful plastic shells ... What changes with the 5C is that the middle tier is suddenly more appealing, and has a brand of its own that Apple can promote apart from the flagship 5S.","With Android-run smartphones made by Samsung and Google cutting into Apple's market share, many see the global appetite for Apple smartphones waning. But preorder numbers for iPhone 5C, even if they are low, may not be the best indication.","For now, Apple will keep plugging away at the 5C. Here's a new one released on Monday:"],"targetTitle":"The iPhone 5C Number Apple Doesn't Want You To Know","targetDescription":"On Monday, Apple managed to make a bit of news by not announcing any.

These repositories are nice to collect our coins in one place, but more often than not, pennies tend to dominate the bulk of the volume. The reason for this is not only that pennies are the lowest denomination, but that people don\u2019t want to use pennies anymore. It actually costs more for the United States to produce a new penny than a penny is worth, meaning they are literal black holes of value. However, just because they may be as good as obsolete in a monetary sense, there are still a lot of things that pennies can be used for with the help of a little creativity. That\u2019s exactly what one mom did with her spare pennies.","Knowing her daughter\u2019s love for dancing and playing, she decided to take some of her old pennies and glue them to the bottom of her daughter\u2019s play shoes, and the results were amazing. The shoes were transformed into make-shift tap shoes, giving her daughter an extra level of excitement during her play time. You might think the sound would be overwhelming, but it was actually quite pleasant to both her and her daughter. It wasn\u2019t too different from the sound of actual tap shoes.","Creative mothers like this one will always find a way to bring a little extra joy to their children with whatever means they have at their disposal.

Rick Snyder (R-Michigan) will shut down a secret fund that paid salaries to his trusted advisors, living expenses for Detroit's emergency manager, and new furniture and security for the Governor's residences, one of his spokepersons confirmed to The Huffington Post.","The \"NERD\" fund, an acronym for \"New Energy to Reinvent and Diversify Fund,\" is a nonprofit, but all the donors' names have been kept anonymous from the public. Gov. Snyder testified in bankruptcy court last week that he did not know any of their identities.","\"There\u2019s an independent board that does that work,\" Snyder said under oath, according to the Detroit News.","In 2011, the secretive fund raised more than $1.3 million. But there's been a sharp drop-off in donations for 2012, with only $368,000 being raised, according to a copy of the 2012 IRS return obtained by the Detroit Free Press.","Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Snyder, told The Huffington Post that the fund had \"had simply become an unnecessary distraction.\" But she was confident that it had obeyed applicable state and federal laws, none of which require donor names to be disclosed, and \"all state and federal tax and election laws and regulations were met and followed closely.\"","She confirmed that a new fund to solicit donations \"will go far above and beyond what the law requires\" -- including full disclosure of donors, gift amounts and expenditure details. She also defended Snyder's need for the fund to subsidize additional government expenses.","\"The function and purposed of the fund is essential to continued reinvention efforts, saving taxpayer dollars, and helping ensure responsive, accessible government,\" Wurfel said.","Snyder still has a solid lead over gubernatorial opponent Mark Schauer in the 2014 election, according to a recent poll published by MIRS. But the fund has become one of the biggest controversies in the Michigan governor's tenure.","Many wonder whether donors or special interest groups contributed to the fund in secret have received any favoritism from the governor's office. NERD is \"fundamentally involved in remaking the form and purposes of state government, and the interests who benefit from that financially would certainly have an interest in supporting it financially,\" Rich Robinson, head of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, told the Detroit Free Press.","\"Shutting down this slush fund in an attempt to avoid transparency only raises more red flags,\" said Michigan State AFL-CIO President Karla Swift in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.","\"Republican Gov. Snyder should keep his promises of transparency and immediately disclose which corporate special interests are backing the NERD Fund,\" Lon Johnson, Michigan Democratic Party Chair, added in a statement sent to The Huffington Post.","There's still no word on whether Gov. Snyder will make the names of donors to the NERD Fund public. A new website, SecretiveSnyder.com, asks, \"When will Snyder come clean?\"","How was the NERD Fund money spent?","Paying for the upscale condo rented at the Westin Book Cadillac by Detroit Emergency Manager Kevyn Orr, as well as other expenses of Orr's. The condo is rented at a price of $4,200 per month; the fund also paid for travel expenses for Orr to see his family, which resides in Maryland. Wurfel told the Detroit Free Press that one of the fund's stated purposes is to offset the cost of governance. Orr's salary is $275,000. \"Given the financial straits of the city, the limited resources of the state, and the very big and challenging job that Kevyn was hired to do, it was deemed appropriate and necessary to help save taxpayer dollars,\" Wurfel said.","$130,638 spent on a security system and new furniture for the state-owned residences used by Gov. Snyder, according to the Detroit Free Press.","$100,000 in consulting fees to MI Partners LLC. Gov. Snyder was the sole client of the consulting firm run by Rich Baird, who Gov. Snyder calls his \"transformation manager,\" according to the Detroit News. Baird, a Snyder adviser who was the architect of the governor's successful campaign team, retired as a global partner from PricewaterhouseCoopers. Baird was appointed a state employee on Wednesday, according to the Detroit News. He will take home an annual salary of $140,000.","Rich DiBartolomeo was Snyder's deputy campaign manager and director of finance. He was paid $48,366 for 10 hours of weekly work as Assistant Secretary and Treasurer of the NERD fund (the 501 (c)4's only paid employee of 2011.) At the same time, he was also collecting a salary from Gov. Snyder's campaign committee, according to Citizensforethics.org. He left both positions in June 2012 for another government job: a $115,000-a-year position as the investment administrator for the Michigan Treasury Department (which manages cities and school districts in financial emergencies)."],"targetTitle":"Rick Snyder Will Shut Down Secret Michigan NERD Fund, Still Hasn't Revealed Donors","targetDescription":"Gov.

Sometimes, presidential visits can get in the way of emergency response, doing more harm than good. But we don\u2019t see that as a factor now that flood waters are subsiding, even if at an agonizing pace. It\u2019s past time for the president to pay a personal visit, showing his solidarity with suffering Americans.","Tough stuff, right?","The second thing that happened was The second thing that happened was this tweet","Obama playing golf at Martha's Vineyard with Larry David today \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) \u2014 Manu Raju (@mkraju) August 18, 2016","Cue outrage.","The I-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to Obama. George W. Bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. ( The I-can't-believe-he-is-on-vacation-while-terrible-news-event-happens narrative is neither new nor unique to Obama. George W. Bush was regularly pilloried by his political opponents for extended vacations at his ranch in Crawford, Tex. ( Bush once took a five-week break during the summer of 2005 .)","And, And, as has been documented ad nauseam , there's really no such thing as a vacation for a president of the United States.\"Presidents don\u2019t get vacations \u2014 they just get a change of scenery,\" Nancy Reagan famously told critics of her husband's regular trips to the family's ranch. Work, especially in this digital age, follows you around.","Still, it's worth noting this moment. And that's because it speaks to Obama's unique and long-lasting commitment to not playing by a core rule of modern politics: making at least some decisions based on \"how it looks\" and\/or \"how it will play.\"","Obama has long been a rejectionist on this front. His stubborn refusal to rebut claims regarding what was in the Affordable Care Act badly hamstrung his party's attempt to win the fight for public perception on the law. His unwillingness to say the words \"radical Islamic terror\" have become a hobbyhorse for conservatives and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. And so on and so forth.","Obama just doesn't like to fake it.

If he doesn't want to do something or thinks it's stupid to do it \u2014 regardless of whether it actuallyisstupid \u2014 he won't do it. This riff in response to Republican criticism of how Obama describes the threat posed by the Islamic State militant group, which is also known as ISIS and ISIL, captures his view on perception politics nicely:","For a while now, the main contribution of some of my friends on the other side of the aisle have made in the fight against ISIL is to criticize this administration and me for not using the phrase \"radical Islam.\" That\u2019s the key, they tell us \u2014 we can\u2019t beat ISIL unless we call them \"radical Islamists.\" What exactly would using this label accomplish? What exactly would it change? Would it make ISIL less committed to trying to kill Americans? Would it bring in more allies? Is there a military strategy that is served by this? The answer is none of the above. Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away. This is a political distraction... ...There has not been a moment in my seven and a half years as president where we have not been able to pursue a strategy because we didn\u2019t use the label \"radical Islam.\" Not once has an adviser of mine said, man, if we really use that phrase, we're going to turn this whole thing around. Not once. So if someone seriously thinks that we don\u2019t know who we're fighting, if there's anyone out there who thinks we're confused about who our enemies are, that would come as a surprise to the thousands of terrorists who we've taken off the battlefield.","He's genuinely angry \u2014 not an emotion you see all that much from any politician at that level but particularly the usually calm and professorial Obama. And he's angry because in Obama's mind the sort of performance-for-the-sake-of-performance that Republicans are demanding is everything that's wrong with politics.","(Nota bene: For all of you \"ALL HE DOES IS PERFORM\" readers, I know that is a view of Obama that many people hold. I am not blind to it. But this piece is about how Obama thinks of himself . Not how you or I think of him. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.)","That's why Obama won't break off his vacation in Martha's Vineyard \u2014 or stop playing golf on said vacation \u2014 to travel to Louisiana. Because he believes he can monitor the situation as well \u2014 or better \u2014 from where he is. And that the sole reason to go to Louisiana is for the theatrical piece of politics, a piece that he not only rejects but detests."],"targetTitle":"Here\u2019s why President Obama isn\u2019t stopping his vacation to visit the Louisiana flooding","targetDescription":"Perception doesn't equal reality in his world.","targetKeywords":"Obama; Obama golf; Obama Louisiana","targetMedia":["data:text\/html;base64,PGh0bWw+PGJvZHkgc3R5bGU9ImJhY2tncm91bmQtY29sb3I6dHJhbnNwYXJlbnQiPgo8L2JvZHk+PC9odG1sPg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/9d6e96ab90744d7d770520d12df4de48e378eba6.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAQAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/712fbf93edbd5f1b9bffe4716edb80df27ae5072","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID\/AMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAQAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/9479c9a02856a7e77fcc6fc06516eedaff5b791d","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/234df44e7909df62a033dcd288dc972bc99c78ab.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/6d3fb276411ba3d852d4406c63608eb56779d599.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAeAAAAEOCAMAAABmRDRVAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC\/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAADUExURUxpcU3H2DoAAAABdFJOUwBA5thmAAAAlUlEQVR42u3BMQEAAADCoPVPbQo\/oAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgK8B+10AAdLgr+0AAAAASUVORK5CYII=","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/401f54cdd7f1e36930812093e694043ffc68a25a.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/1dde477fba66e674b8ac6ecb332ed4a308d18d95.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/8f629056c13de39d15ab6f3f43efad2619d5e8cf","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/f3a2a885763edf95f88cac8ebf2697a73d8f5c7f.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/1b8066a9f54a40296067ae404406ffe6b3ce81a2\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/d4178b977037993e941ff7416e148780a6c0ed04.png","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/d235c8fa3a39bd7d3466c44a81d7b154be0943c3.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/58ca6fba98b103d00b935898f75b38e430e2edb6","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/f357c209e0c1099fa19a9e1180a4bee66ca94188.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/25222a2af2c7e7942b8f15bf80a7e869db4151c6.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ\/b7f0a59dc03b2cdb0b5130fcfb8d17e214c8296f.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/Aa6iZ","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"He thinks visiting the flooding in Louisiana would just be political theater","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["Because he believes he can monitor the situation as well \u2014 or better \u2014 from where he is"],"spoilerPositions":[[[16,133],[16,220]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":101}

Wellington-based journalist Ben Collins asks whether New Zealand is becoming a \"utopia\" for Americans looking to leave.","Forget bunkers in the forest full of food tins and bottled water - it seems New Zealand, with a population of 4.4 million, has become the best option for a new breed of American survivalist.","When the New Zealand Herald revealed this week that Silicon Valley tech billionaire Peter Thiel had become a citizen and purchased a lake-front estate it perhaps shouldn't have been a surprise.","Mr Thiel, who previously said New Zealand was a \"utopia\" and has invested heavily there, is just one of several US migrants who have realised what the country has to offer.","Punching above its weight","New Zealand recently overtook Singapore as the best place to do business, according to the World Bank. Transparency International ranks it as the world's least corrupt country, and the 2016 Global Peace Index said it was the fourth safest behind Iceland, Denmark and Austria.","\"We've definitely had an increase in American inquiries, and at least one sale that has been a direct run-off from the presidential result in the United States,\" says Nick Horton, an agent specialising in luxury real estate.","\"There's just a feeling that people want to create a bolthole in the southern hemisphere that's away from some of the problems facing the Western world,\" he says.","Recently, the New Yorker magazine ran a piece titled Doomsday Prep for the Super-rich. It detailed the rise in wealthy investors who see New Zealand as their escape from a volatile world.","It is safe and clean. The west coast of the United States is a 13-hour flight away, and modern technology has tamed the tyranny of distance.","The temperate, mountainous country is also comparably well-placed to deal with rising sea levels, and its most recent major attack was in 1985, when French spies blew up a Greenpeace vessel in Auckland harbour.","However, as Horton explains, the interest from the United States is not new.","\"The same happened after the global financial crisis, and the same thing happened after Obama was elected, when some people thought the United States wouldn't tolerate having a black leader.\"","US surge","According to Immigration New Zealand, in November 2016 when the US presidential election was held, 17,584 people registered their interest to study, work or invest in the country, compared with 1,272 in November 2015.","In the two days following the election, the agency said its website received 88,353 visits from the United States - compared to a usual daily average of 2,300 visits a day.","Registrations have remained higher than average, with 3,159 received this month, compared to 1,724 in January 2016.","However, registrations are far higher than actual visa applications.","Between October and December last year, 348 residency visas were granted to people from the United States, compared with 338 in the same period in 2015. Work visas rose from 2,296 to 2,699 over the same period.","\"What we are experiencing at the moment is a slight increase in visas issued to American nationals, both temporary work visas and permanent resident visas,\" Steve McGill, general manager at Immigration New Zealand, told the BBC.","\"We have had a pretty active strategy of identifying investors out of America over the past few years.","\"It's a combination of our marketing effort, and a bit of global uncertainty that means New Zealand is a pretty attractive place,\" Mr McGill said.","The revelation that Mr Thiel had quietly become a New Zealand citizen has raised some questions about the processes for foreign investors, with some politicians asking how, exactly, he was able to secure it and whether he was given special treatment.","But Mr McGill said opposition to wealthy investors, who can secure a residency visa by spending a minimum amount in the country, was not a major issue.","\"I am aware of the recent commentary around Mr Thiel, but there is no evidence of any backlash against migrant investors coming in. What we do know is that many of the investors who come out deliver significant value in the form of job creation in the communities.","\"We are a small island nation at the bottom of the world with lots of resources and opportunities and we need to maximise that, and some of the way we can do that is bringing in investors,\" he said.","Better lifestyle","It isn't just the mega-wealthy that are attracted to New Zealand. Sarah Coombes-Crome, an immigration consultant, said that traffic to her firm's website was up approximately 600% the day after Donald Trump won the election and has remained higher than average.","\"They are from all over the United States and are educated, looking to either work in New Zealand or invest if they have a considerable amount of capital behind them.\"","\"I think New Zealand and the United States are very similar,\" she said.","\"They are both English speaking countries, they think similar, they have the same values and similar religious beliefs. It's also very easy to buy a property or do business in New Zealand, you can move your money around freely.\"","Chris Whelan, the chief executive of the Wellington regional economic development agency, says the country offers plenty of career opportunities, but with a much better lifestyle that you would find elsewhere.","\"I was talking to someone out of San Diego this morning and he's looking to invest potentially tens of millions of dollars in New Zealand.","\"For him it's got excellent skills, excellent talent, and what was previous a boundary (distance)... with modern technology you're connected to the world all the time.","\"It's a country with a similar land mass to Britain but with 4.4 million people.\""],"targetTitle":"The lure of New Zealand for jaded Americans","targetDescription":"Why New Zealand has become an attractive place for wealthy Americans looking for a distant bolthole.","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["Mr Thiel, who previously said New Zealand was a \"utopia\" and has invested heavily there, is just one of several US migrants who have realised what the country has to offer."],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,0],[3,172]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":102}

The new study is the first to take into account the levels of arsenic in the participants' household water when looking at the amount of arsenic coming from foods.","The results suggest that diet can be an important source of people's arsenic exposure over the long term, regardless of arsenic concentrations in their drinking water, the researchers said.","The element arsenic occurs naturally in the environment. Long-term exposure to arsenic, even at low levels, has been linked to increased risks of bladder, lung and skin cancer, as well as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits the arsenic in drinking water to 10 micrograms per litter for drinking water, but there are few limits set for foods. [5 Things You Should Know About Arsenic]","In the study, the arsenic levels in the participants' household tap water were well below the EPA limit, at 0.30 micrograms per liter, on average. However, 52 participants had tap water arsenic levels higher than the EPA's limits.","The arsenic levels in participants' toenails were 0.12 micrograms per gram, on average. However, it is unclear what level of concentration found in toenail samples might signal an unsafe level of arsenic exposure, said study author Kathryn Cottingham, researcher at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.","The toenail measurements in the study served only as a way to compare levels among people, the researchers said.","People who reported drinking on average two and half beers or a glass of white wine every day had arsenic levels 20 to 30 percent higher than those of people who didn't drink.","The study wasn't designed to find why higher consumption of beer and wine was linked to higher arsenic levels, but a few scenarios are possible, Cottingham said. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]","One possibility is that the ingredients in beer and wine are high in arsenic. It is also possible that arsenic is added during the filtration process that gives beer and wine their sparkly, clear looks, as one recent study suggested, Cottingham said.","And lastly, alcohol itself may be to blame for the higher arsenic levels, by impairing the body's ability to detoxify arsenic.","\"The mechanisms that our bodies use to try to get rid of the stuff that is not good for us can be impaired by alcohol consumption,\" Cottingham said.","The researchers didn't find a link between arsenic levels and intake of rice, which is thought to be relatively high in arsenic. But in line with previous studies, they found that the more dark-meat fish people ate, the higher were their arsenic levels.","People who ate dark-meat fish once a week had about a 7 percent higher arsenic concentration in their toenails compared with people who consumed these fish less than once a month.","Although some foods are high in arsenic, people don't need to avoid them entirely, Cottingham said. \"Probably the best way to avoid exposure from diet is to mix it up in the foods, and not eat the same thing every day.\"","It's also important to keep water sources safe, she said. \"If someone is drinking water from a private well, they should get it tested. Water is something we are drinking and using every day,\" Cottingham said. \"So knowing what your water exposure is, I think, is a big piece of the puzzle.\""],"targetTitle":"White Wine And Beer Are Sources Of Arsenic In Diets, Study Finds","targetDescription":"By Bahar Gholipour, Staff Writer \r\nPublished: 11\/27\/2013 08:58 AM EST on LiveScience\r\n\r\n White wine, beer and Brussels sprouts can be major sources of...","targetKeywords":"brussels sprouts arsenic,white wine arsenic,arsenic diet food,arsenic diet,white wine arsenic diet,beer arsenic","targetMedia":["http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1486170\/images\/n-WHITE-WINE-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1486170\/images\/o-WHITE-WINE-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1c8YUZ0","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Arsenic; also found in water beer food etc.","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["toxic metal arsenic"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,66],[0,85]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":106}

Problem is, he won\u2019t carry his EpiPen around with him \u2014 because it won\u2019t fit into his pocket.","\"It\u2019s large and it\u2019s impractical,\" Clark said. \"Where\u2019s he going to put it?\"","This underscores a simple truth: EpiPens just aren\u2019t that great.","They\u2019re reliable, sure. They\u2019ll buy a patient who\u2019s in the midst of a severe allergic reaction a few crucial minutes to make his way to the hospital.","But they\u2019re also bulky. Their epinephrine solution isn\u2019t particularly shelf-stable, and will easily degrade in temperatures that are too low or too high. They expire after about a year. And they\u2019re not so user-friendly. Though EpiPens come with a practice kit, users in the midst of an allergy attack have mistaken which end\u2019s the pointy end \u2014 and stabbed their thumbs instead of their thighs.","The devices have come under fire in the past month for their escalating sticker price: a pack of two EpiPens now lists for $608. Mylan, which owns the EpiPen brand (though the device itself is actually manufactured by Pfizer) notes that it redesigned the product in 2009, added features including the flip-top case, and is \"investing substantial amounts in research into additional improvements, such as a formulation with a longer shelf life.\"","But critics say Mylan has little incentive to improve EpiPens: \"If you\u2019re the monopolist, and you\u2019ve got a product that expires every year, and it\u2019s not super easy to carry around so the safest thing to do is have several tucked away in different places \u2014 I don\u2019t see why there would be any pressure to innovate,\" said Nicholson Price, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan Law School who studies health care regulation and patent law.","\"EpiPen\u2019s flaws seem like features, not a bug,\" Price said.","Competitors have tried to make runs at the EpiPen. And more are trying now that there\u2019s such a spotlight on the product. But it\u2019s unclear if anything can displace the familiar auto-injector with the bright orange cap.","Here\u2019s why:","1. Mylan has patent protection that lasts through 2025","Epinephrine, as a drug, was first synthesized more than a century ago. It\u2019s been used for various medical applications since then, and was first packaged in an auto-injector (to protect soldiers against chemical warfare) back in the 1970s.","But Mylan has a lock on the particular EpiPen design that millions of patients, parents, and school nurses have come to trust.","The company\u2019s main innovation has been a bright orange cap that covers the needle, but releases automatically when a patient pushes an EpiPen against her thigh, so there\u2019s no need to stop and unscrew the cover in the midst of an allergy attack.","The very fact that the EpiPen has been dominant for so long makes it hard for challengers to come in with a radically different design. (Mylan is now pledging to make a generic version, which it says will be identical except for the label.)","\"If you\u2019re a parent, and your child\u2019s suffering from an allergic reaction, you have to give them an injection \u2014 and don\u2019t want to read the instructions in that moment,\" said Matthew Allen, head of drug delivery for Cambridge Consultants. \"You just have to know how to use it.\"","Allen\u2019s work at Cambridge Consultants centers around designing other forms of auto-injectors. He said the Food and Drug Administration has rules to standardize the way these life-saving devices work. Those rules keep consumers safe. But they also make it difficult to come up with design that can meet the standards \u2014 without infringing on Mylan\u2019s patent.","\"It would not be very difficult to create an EpiPen product, in terms of engineering,\" Allen said. \"It\u2019s not rocket science. It\u2019s purely the patent that stops us.\"","2. There\u2019s no room for error when you\u2019re treating anaphylaxis","Chris Stepanian is CEO of Windgap Medical, a Boston startup that\u2019s been working on a next-generation epinephrine auto-injector for the past five years.","Windgap\u2019s device is meant to improve upon the EpiPen: It\u2019s supposed to be smaller, about the size of a Bic lighter, with a much more stable formulation of epinephrine intended to survive in a pants pocket without getting overheated.","But that\u2019s proving easier said than done. Stepanian said he\u2019s at least a few years away from bringing his newfangled auto-injector to market.","Though EpiPen components look pretty basic, Mylan notes that it is made up of 26 parts and must be able to deliver the drug with a sterile needle within seconds. Stepanian agrees that it\u2019s more complicated than it seems at first glance: \"It\u2019s really challenging to make a reliable auto-injector \u2014 and surprisingly hard to make a combination drug product,\" he said.","\"It\u2019s a tough thing to nail down the drug supply chain, the plastics and design, and then incorporate that all together, and put the drug inside it \u2014 and then regardless of how the user uses it, get the appropriate dose within the acceptable limits of the FDA,\" Stepanian added. \"At least Mylan and Pfizer have done a good job of making a pretty reliable one.\"","One EpiPen alternative that did make it to market: The Auvi-Q, an epinephrine auto-injector shaped like a bulky credit card. But Sanofi recalled the devices last year over concerns that patients weren\u2019t getting the correct dose every time. It returned the commercial and marketing rights to Kaleo, from whom it licensed the auto-injector in 2009. A representative from Kaleo said that it\u2019s \"in the process of evaluating when and how\" to bring the Auvi-Q back to the market \u2014 but Sanofi is no longer involved.","3. It doesn\u2019t take an auto-injector to get epinephrine into the body \u2014 but it sure helps","In the wake of the recent outrage at Mylan, Los Angeles-based MannKind Corporation announced it\u2019s developing an inhalable form of epinephrine.","\"We could make something very tiny, that you could carry on a keychain \u2014 much smaller than an EpiPen or auto-injector by far,\" MannKind CEO Matthew Pfeffer said.","MannKind already has an inhalable insulin product, called Afrezza, on the market, which gives diabetics an alternative to injections. But it\u2019s proved exceedingly tough to get patients to switch from a format of insulin intake they\u2019re familiar with to an inhaler. Sales have been far below expectations.","The same problem could stymie an epinephrine inhaler, especially since one of the frightening features of an anaphylactic attack is that the airways constrict \u2014 which, in theory anyway, could make it hard for a patient to use the inhaler in a moment of crisis.","4. The regulatory process is slow and expensive","A lot of the challenge lies in the regulatory system, said Mark Baum, CEO of San Diego-based Imprimis \u2014 a compound pharmaceutical company that\u2019s working on a cheaper alternative to the EpiPen. It can take a long time, and a lot of money, to get FDA approval for a new product.","\"The only time it makes economic sense to take the risk of going through these clinical trials is when you have a situation like this,\" Baum said. \"But when the market was more normalized \u2014 when the EpiPen was only retailing around $100 \u2014 competitors questioned whether it was worth taking that risk.\"","Public anger at EpiPen is so high right now that Baum figures it is worth taking the risk. Imprimis has had its eyes on the epinephrine auto-injector market for about two years now; it\u2019s finally going to go for it.","\"We\u2019re just focused on being that competition,\" he said.","5. The public hasn\u2019t spoken (loud enough)","Denise Clark, whose son has that peanut allergy, is a consultant with Boston MedTech Advisors. She helps medical device companies with design, market analysis, and regulatory strategy.","But though she works in the field every day, she says she never even thought much about the flaws of the EpiPen design \u2014 or the lack of innovation \u2014 until the product started hitting headlines.","\"It\u2019s something that\u2019s always been irritating to me, but not to the point that I\u2019ve looked at it closely \u2014 until I had to start paying all this money,\" Clark said.","Granted, the Federal Trade Commission has been fielding complaints about Mylan\u2019s pricing for years, and complaints about the device\u2019s clunkiness are no secret. But since the EpiPen is generally covered by insurance, many customers have simply gone with it. That means there\u2019s been little pressure from the paying public for innovation.","\"I guess Mylan\u2019s motto is, \u2018If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u2019\" Clark said. \"They have such a monopoly, so why would they bother improving the EpiPen?\""],"targetTitle":"5 reasons why no one has built a better EpiPen","targetDescription":"EpiPens aren't that great.

{"postId":"789187099798888448","postText":["Here's what Donald Trump rejects when he undermines the election results"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In what immediately became the headline moment at the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday night, Republican candidate Donald Trump sparked widespread outrage by saying he would keep the nation \"in suspense\" about whether he will accept the results of the election next month.","\"But, sir, there is a tradition in this country\u2014in fact, one of the prides of this country is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner,\" said moderator Chris Wallace. \"Not saying that you\u2019re necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country.\"","Indeed, the nation's ability to regularly and peacefully replace the President was, to the world of the 1700s, one of the most striking elements of the American experiment. As John Adams himself wrote to his wife upon his becoming the second president in 1797, the transfer of power was \"the sublimest Thing ever exhibited in America.\"","But while Adams was the first to experience that transition, it wasn't until four years later that the principle was put to the test.","After all, George Washington didn't want to run again for the 1796 election and Adams kept power within the same party. In 1800, on the other hand , the United States saw its first hotly contested election and its first transfer of power between political parties. The result was close, and it also left Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied, with the House spending a week deciding who would be President. (At the time, the Vice President was whoever came in second.) It was easily conceivable that the entire system would fall apart, but instead Jefferson became President and his rivals\u2014the incumbent Adams as well as Burr\u2014accepted the result. As Jefferson would later write , the \"revolution of 1800\" was a big deal:","[It was] as real a revolution in the principles of our government as that of 1776 was in its form; not effected indeed by the sword, as that, but by the rational and peaceable instrument of reform, the suffrage of the people. The nation declared its will by dismissing functionaries of one principle, and electing those of another, in the two branches, executive and legislative, submitted to their election.","This principle\u2014that the nation declares its will by voting, and the functionaries of government peacefully accept the choice\u2014has even been upheld when perhaps the candidate might have wished to do otherwise.","For example, some believe that the 1960 presidential election was subject to substantial enough voting irregularities that Richard Nixon should have won. (In fact, there is no concrete evidence either way .) But, even though it was an extremely close race and some of his supporters urged him to fight the result, Nixon decided that, in keeping with tradition, it was better to accept the fact that early returns indicated John F Kennedy had won. In a late-night speech to supporters, he explained why:","As all of you in this room know, and as all of you millions who are listening on television and radio realize, it is normally the custom for a candidate for the Presidency...not to appear until after the decision is definitely known, and all the votes are counted beyond doubt. However, I have been keeping some pretty late hours recently as some of you have...I know too that many who are listening in the Eastern part of the United States will find that it is now about 3:15 in the morning... I want to say that one of the great features of America is that we have political contests, that they are very hard fought, as this one was hard fought, and once the decision is made, we unite behind the man who is elected... I want Senator Kennedy to know, and I want all of you to know, that certainly if this trend continues, and if he does become our next President, he will have my whole-hearted support.","That tradition even held true in 2000. As TIME's David Von Drehle has pointed out , that year's concession from Al Gore to George W. Bush was a long time in coming not because Gore refused to accept the results of the vote, but because there was no result to accept yet. In fact, when it became clear what the result would be, Gore followed the precedent of hundreds of years' worth of elections, as he peacefully accepted the outcome of the vote. As he explained in his concession speech, that was what patriotism required:","Almost a century and a half ago, Senator Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln, who had just defeated him for the presidency, ''Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism. I'm with you, Mr. President, and God bless you.'' Well, in that same spirit, I say to President-elect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside, and may God bless his stewardship of this country. Neither he nor I anticipated this long and difficult road. Certainly neither of us wanted it to happen. Yet it came, and now it has ended, resolved, as it must be resolved, through the honored institutions of our democracy.","That doesn't mean the tradition has always been honored by everyone. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln was elected, Stephen Douglas (the runner-up for the popular vote) had cause to utter those words later quoted by Gore, as he conceded the result. But, even before the election took place, the South had already warned the nation that a victory by Lincoln and the Republican Party would be unacceptable in their eyes.","South Carolina seceded from the Union that December, declaring that the North was \"united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery.\" Rather than accept the electoral result, the state convention announced that \"public opinion at the North has invested a great political error\" and that South Carolina would not go along with the outcome. The rest of the Confederacy would soon follow South Carolina's lead. By April, the Civil War had begun."],"targetTitle":"Here's What Donald Trump Rejects When He Undermines the Election Results","targetDescription":"The Republican candidate has refused to commit to accepting the results of November's election.

In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains","The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause. In 2016, it seems that there is still work to do, although great gains have been made in recent years. More and more states in America are legalizing same-sex marriage and are opening their doors, hearts, and minds to same-sex couples. Still, it is difficult for gays, lesbians, and bisexuals to be taken seriously or treated with respect in some places. There are still people out there who turn these individuals away from their homes and businesses, but with the help of organizations and groups that promote acceptance and tolerance, circumstances can shift.","We are going to name 15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn\u2019t Know Came Out in 2016, so that you can see just how many celebs are taking a stand for this community. You may know of some actors, musicians, and authors who have come out as gay (think Wanda Sykes and Zachary Quinto), but there may be other famous people you didn\u2019t know identify as bisexual, lesbian, gay, or somewhere else on the spectrum. So take in this information and you will see just how many people belong to and feel connected to this community.","We should point out that there are also some celebs who have been rumored to be gay or lesbian or something else, but the gossip is false, and they wont appear below. One example is singer Selena Gomez. While she doesn\u2019t identify as an LGBTQ individual, she is still happy that she's able to be a positive role model. Are there any names on this list that really surprised you? Feel free to share the list on social media!","15 Kristen Stewart","Actress Kristen Stewart was the other half to actor Robert Pattinson for years, and the two were a discrete power couple in Hollywood in the past. Yet in early 2016, Stewart came totally forward and proclaimed her sexuality for all to hear and see. The 26-year-old is now in a romantic relationship with her personal assistant Alicia Cargile, and before that, Stewart was dating Soko, French actress and musician. Just two years ago, Stewart was ending her long-standing relationship with Pattinson, and before that, she was dating another one of her co-stars, Michael Angarano. Stewart and Cargile have only been dating since July of 2016, but Stewart has expressed that she is very happy with their relationship. As for Cargile, she may be a bit more rampant with her sexuality, as she was seen donning a baseball cap that said \"Make America Gay Again.\" It was obviously a direct hit to Presidential candidate, Donald Trump.","14 Aubrey Plaza","Who didn\u2019t love watching Aubrey Plaza play Andy\u2019s (Chris Pratt\u2019s) girlfriend April on Parks and Recreation? Plaza plays the perfect cynical Debbie Downer character, but the 32-year-old actress\u2019 unique and distinguishable character traits aren\u2019t the only thing that makes her special. Plaza revealed earlier in 2016 that gender \"isn\u2019t a factor\" for her when it comes to dating and romantic relationships. The actress is perfectly fine getting with someone whether they are a girl, guy, or don\u2019t identify as either. Plaza\u2019s revelation came during an interview with The Advocate, one of the most influential gay news magazines. Plaza did not call herself a bisexual, but she did say that she has a very \"androgynous and masculine\" aura about her, and that tends to attract many different kinds of people, which she is totally cool with. She then blatantly stated that she falls in love \"with girls and guys,\" and that she can\u2019t help it.","13 Mara Wilson","Sometimes it takes a tragedy for people to open up about their own struggles. So it was with Mara Wilson, the 28-year-old actress who starred in hit films such as Matilda and Miracle on 34th Street. Wilson was so deeply moved after the shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, that she Tweeted her emotions and truth for her fans. Wilson wrote \"F*cking hell, Orlando.\" She then referred to a picture of herself ten years ago at a gay nightclub and added the caption: \"I have never had a better experience at a club than I did then...the LGBT community has always felt like home, especially a few years later when I, uh, learned something about myself.\" Wilson then pointed out the Kinsey scale, which some people use as a measurement of one\u2019s sexuality, from 100% straight to 100% homosexual. Wilson stated that she was a 2, meaning that she identifies as a queer and a bisexual.","12 Colton Haynes","Actor Colton Haynes started 2016 by unloading a heavy burden about his sexuality. The 27-year-old actor is best known for his role on the MTV series Teen Wolf, and he chose a subtle way to break the news about his sexual orientation. Taking to social media, Haynes commented on a Tumblr post that someone wrote which explained how they were shocked to hear about Haynes\u2019 \"secret gay past,\" and that it got them \"so excited.\" Haynes then responded to the Tumblr post, writing \"Was it a secret? Let\u2019s all just enjoy life & have no regrets.\" Many people have assumed that this was Haynes\u2019 way to publicly coming out as gay, even though he didn\u2019t say he was gay directly. It is safe to say that he took a nonchalant approach and that he no longer has to worry about his sexuality being a secret. He certainly made the Tumblr world happy!","11 Reid Ewing","If the name Reid Ewing sounds familiar, that\u2019s because he is one of the famed actors from the hit TV series Modern Family. Ewing plays the role of Dylan, who is a recurring secondary character in the show, which is no stranger to exploring societal norms and challenges, such as same-sex relationships. The 27-year-old actor stepped forward earlier this year to share some serious information about himself. When writing on a guest blog post for HuffPost Healthy Living, Ewing wrote about his struggles with body dysmorphia before taking to Twitter to tell everyone in the chillest way possible that he is gay. His tweet read: \"Saw Eugene Bata on @GMA in the Body Dysmorphia segment connected to my article I just want to say he is hot af.\" Someone commented and asked \"Did you just out yourself?\" to which Ewing replied \"I was never in.\" *Drops mic* That\u2019s the way to do it!","10 Shane Dawson","For years, YouTube sensation and funny guy Shane Dawson was suspected of being gay. He would often perform hilarious skits in which he would play flamboyant characters or feisty females. Plus, with his cute emo haircut and his higher-pitched voice, he set off plenty of people\u2019s gaydar. A few months ago, Dawson released a YouTube video on his channel simply titled \"I\u2019m Bisexual.\" In the video, Dawson told his 6 million followers that he had been struggling with his sexual identity for years, and that he wasn\u2019t sure whether he was straight or gay or somewhere in between. He hoped that by releasing his video for his fans, others would realize that they\u2019re not alone in their struggles with sexuality. Stating that, \"I don\u2019t know who I am 100 percent. And I know that a lot of you guys might feel the same way,\" Dawson preferred to call himself a bisexual.","9 Ryan Beatty","Another celeb who came out in 2016 was singer Ryan Beatty. The 20-year-old became famous thanks to his stellar YouTube videos that showed off his vocal talent and charming good looks. Beatty then began to break out into the public sphere and could be one of the next great male solo artists. A few months ago, Beatty used social media (fittingly enough, since that\u2019s where he achieved fame) to tell his fans that he was gay. His Instagram post included the words \"raging homosexual\" and \"gay power.\" Beatty stated that it took him two decades to come to terms with his sexuality, but now he is \"comfortable enough to say it\" and \"can finally breathe.\" The singer also took to the Twitterverse and Tweeted: \"i\u2019m so happy i\u2019m gay\" and he also thanked his friends and family for their support. The announcement came right before the release of his single, \"Passion.\"","8 Rayvon Owen","Some of you may remember Rayvon Owen from American Idol\u2019s 14th season, on which he was the third runner-up. The 24-year-old singer was nearly guaranteed success in the music world after his American Idol performances, but people were not expecting the star to come out, especially in the way that he did. Owen released a music video for his song \"Can\u2019t Fight It\" earlier this year, and in this video, he explores the concept of his sexuality and how he had to come to terms with it. In \"Can\u2019t Fight It,\" Owen can be seen going through a nightclub, and the sexy vibe lets us know that something\u2019s up. By the end of the music video, Owen has found a guy that suits his fancy. He takes the man\u2019s hand, kisses him, and thus reveals that he is now an openly gay singer. Plus, the other guy in the video was played by Shane Bitney Crone, a pivotal advocate and public figure in the LGBTQ community.","7 Gloria Vanderbilt","Famed and respected news journalist for CNN, Anderson Cooper, has been out as a gay man since 2012, but earlier this year he was thrown for a loop when his own mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, dropped some bombshell information. Vanderbilt spoke during a joint interview alongside Cooper and revealed that when she was a teenager, she had a lesbian relationship with one of her classmates. It was a piece of information that had been unknown to Cooper for his entire life, and the way the journalist reacted was downright adorable, as he shrugged his shoulders at his mom and said, \"What? This is news to me.\" Mother and son shared a cute giggle together and Cooper seemed grateful to know that his own mother had experimented with her sexuality. The whole thing was quite touching, and in fact, Vanderbilt wrote a book with her son which was recently published entitled The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A Mother and Son On Life, Love, and Loss.","6 Nur Warsame","Nur Warsame is an imam in Australia, and for those of you who don\u2019t know an imam is an Islamic worship or mosque leader in the Muslim faith. Warsame came out at the start of the summer in 2016 and became the first imam in Australia to openly identify as gay. Naturally, Warsame has dealt with an outpouring or both support and hate. There have been a number of mosques in Australia that will not accept Warsame through its doors, while other Muslim leaders have spoken out against Warsame and said that his acceptance of his sexuality is wrong. On the other hand, there have been other leaders and people in the public who have commended Warsame for his actions. Warsame was previously married to a woman and he also has a young daughter. He is now an advocate for other Muslims who may be struggling with their own sexuality.'"],"targetTitle":"15 LGBTQ Celebrities You Didn\u2019t Know Came Out In 2016","targetDescription":"The LGBTQ community is growing, both in terms of members who identify as LGBTQ or straight supporters who want to help the cause.

Working and spending each day with your partner can be challenging at the best of times, but we never predicted that Kit Harington's girlfriend would have such thoughts. Despite bagging one of the most sought-after hunks on the small screen, Rose Leslie has pledged to never work with her love again.","The 29-year-old redhead had the pleasure of acting as Ygritte alongside her scraggly-haired beau \u2013 who has captured the hearts of many a teenage fangirl \u2013 during her stint in hit television series, Game Of Thrones. Whilst the majority of human kind would be more than happy to spend every living hour with Harington, she's decided she has better things to do.","As much as she loves her boyfriend, Leslie wants to achieve her own success away from the gossip-mongers who feed off her high-profile relationship, which means working on individual projects and carving out a career on her own accord.","Leslie told the Evening Standard: \"I think we leave it at that. We had such a fabulous time working together on Thrones.","\"I think it's important to do your own projects that mean a lot to you individually, rather than be associated with someone else. I'm a big believer in doing your own thing,\" she added.","It's not as if the lovebirds really had the choice of working together on GoTagain, as both of their on-screen alter egos were killed off. Ygritte kicked the bucket after being shot by a child with a bow and arrow, and died in Jon Snow's (Harington) arms, whilst poor Snowy was left for dead after being stabbed multiple times. Grim viewing, to say the least. It was during her 17 episodes on the show that she became Snow's love interest, both on and off screen.","Insisting she wouldn't like to see her character brought back from the dead, she continued: \"I'm now a little pile of ash. The writers are being incredibly loyal to the books and the way it's developed Jon Snow needs to be on his own and take charge of his own life.

{"postId":"837890623080386560","postText":["After learning she didn't have long to live, she composed a dating profile for the man she'd leave behind"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["I have been trying to write this for a while, but the morphine and lack of juicy cheeseburgers (what has it been now, five weeks without real food?) have drained my energy and interfered with whatever prose prowess remains. Additionally, the intermittent micronaps that keep whisking me away midsentence are clearly not propelling my work forward as quickly as I would like. But they are, admittedly, a bit of trippy fun.","Still, I have to stick with it, because I\u2019m facing a deadline, in this case, a pressing one. I need to say this (and say it right) while I have a) your attention, and b) a pulse.","I have been married to the most extraordinary man for 26 years. I was planning on at least another 26 together.","Want to hear a sick joke? A husband and wife walk into the emergency room in the late evening on Sept. 5, 2015. A few hours and tests later, the doctor clarifies that the unusual pain the wife is feeling on her right side isn\u2019t the no-biggie appendicitis they suspected but rather ovarian cancer.","As the couple head home in the early morning of Sept. 6, somehow through the foggy shock of it all, they make the connection that today, the day they learned what had been festering, is also the day they would have officially kicked off their empty-nestering. The youngest of their three children had just left for college.","So many plans instantly went poof.","No trip with my husband and parents to South Africa. No reason, now, to apply for the Harvard Loeb Fellowship. No dream tour of Asia with my mother. No writers\u2019 residencies at those wonderful schools in India, Vancouver, Jakarta.","No wonder the word cancer and cancel look so similar.","This is when we entered what I came to think of as Plan \"Be,\" existing only in the present. As for the future, allow me to introduce you to the gentleman of this article, Jason Brian Rosenthal.","He is an easy man to fall in love with. I did it in one day.","Let me explain: My father\u2019s best friend since summer camp, \"Uncle\" John, had known Jason and me separately our whole lives, but Jason and I had never met. I went to college out east and took my first job in California. When I moved back home to Chicago, John \u2014 who thought Jason and I were perfect for each other \u2014 set us up on a blind date.","It was 1989. We were only 24. I had precisely zero expectations about this going anywhere. But when he knocked on the door of my little frame house, I thought, \"Uh-oh, there is something highly likable about this person.\"","By the end of dinner, I knew I wanted to marry him.","Jason? He knew a year later.","I have never been on Tinder, Bumble or eHarmony, but I\u2019m going to create a general profile for Jason right here, based on my experience of coexisting in the same house with him for, like, 9,490 days.","First, the basics: He is 5-foot-10, 160 pounds, with salt-and-pepper hair and hazel eyes.","The following list of attributes is in no particular order because everything feels important to me in some way.","He is a sharp dresser. Our young adult sons, Justin and Miles, often borrow his clothes. Those who know him \u2014 or just happen to glance down at the gap between his dress slacks and dress shoes \u2014 know that he has a flair for fabulous socks. He is fit and enjoys keeping in shape.","If our home could speak, it would add that Jason is uncannily handy. On the subject of food \u2014 man, can he cook. After a long day, there is no sweeter joy than seeing him walk in the door, plop a grocery bag down on the counter, and woo me with olives and some yummy cheese he has procured before he gets to work on the evening\u2019s meal.","Jason loves listening to live music; it\u2019s our favorite thing to do together. I should also add that our 19-year-old daughter, Paris, would rather go to a concert with him than anyone else.","When I was working on my first memoir, I kept circling sections my editor wanted me to expand upon. She would say, \"I\u2019d like to see more of this character.\"","Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.","Of course, I would agree \u2014 he was indeed a captivating character. But it was funny because she could have just said: \"Jason. Let\u2019s add more about Jason.\"","He is an absolutely wonderful father. Ask anyone. See that guy on the corner? Go ahead and ask him; he\u2019ll tell you. Jason is compassionate \u2014 and he can flip a pancake.","Jason paints. I love his artwork. I would call him an artist except for the law degree that keeps him at his downtown office most days from 9 to 5. Or at least it did before I got sick.","If you\u2019re looking for a dreamy, let\u2019s-go-for-it travel companion, Jason is your man. He also has an affinity for tiny things: taster spoons, little jars, a mini-sculpture of a couple sitting on a bench, which he presented to me as a reminder of how our family began.","Here is the kind of man Jason is: He showed up at our first pregnancy ultrasound with flowers. This is a man who, because he is always up early, surprises me every Sunday morning by making some kind of oddball smiley face out of items near the coffeepot: a spoon, a mug, a banana.","This is a man who emerges from the minimart or gas station and says, \"Give me your palm.\" And, voila\u0300, a colorful gumball appears. (He knows I love all the flavors but white.)","My guess is you know enough about him now. So let\u2019s swipe right.","Wait. Did I mention that he is incredibly handsome? I\u2019m going to miss looking at that face of his.","If he sounds like a prince and our relationship seems like a fairy tale, it\u2019s not too far off, except for all of the regular stuff that comes from two and a half decades of playing house together. And the part about me getting cancer. Blech.","In my most recent memoir (written entirely before my diagnosis), I invited readers to send in suggestions for matching tattoos, the idea being that author and reader would be bonded by ink.","I was totally serious about this and encouraged submitters to be serious as well. Hundreds poured in. A few weeks after publication in August, I heard from a 62-year-old librarian in Milwaukee named Paulette.","She suggested the word \"more.\" This was based on an essay in the book where I mention that \"more\" was my first spoken word (true). And now it may very well be my last (time shall tell).","In September, Paulette drove down to meet me at a Chicago tattoo parlor. She got hers (her very first) on her left wrist. I got mine on the underside of my left forearm, in my daughter\u2019s handwriting. This was my second tattoo; the first is a small, lowercase \"j\" that has been on my ankle for 25 years.

When Canadian car buyers enter their postal code and information at EasyAuto123.com , many are shocked at the results they find.

The truth is people say it\u2018s possible to spend as low as $147 \/month with $0 down on their car payment2 and some say they were eligible for lower rates due to new government programs. When we heard about these claims, we decided to investigate for ourselves.","We sent out our very own Tim Palmer to test these online comparison services and see if they lived up to the hype.

Here\u2019s what they have in common","Every night for 20 years, Gino Rodriguez knelt beside his three daughters\u2019 beds and whispered an incantation. As rats the size of footballs skittered along the floor of the basement apartment on the South Side of Chicago, he repeated the same five words into each girl\u2019s ear as she slept: \"I can and I will.\" The message was always the same, and the audience was always asleep.","\"You talk to the subconscious. You don\u2019t talk to the conscious,\" Rodriguez says. \"That\u2019s the one that really listens.\"","The girls slept \"hot-dog style,\" cocooned in tightly wrapped sheets to keep out the vermin. They occasionally woke up during their father\u2019s nightly pep talks, rolled their eyes and then went back to sleep. But each morning, they did a series of jumping jacks, looked in the mirror and said, \"Today is going to be a great day. I can and I will.\"","Video by Diane Tsai for TIME","Not all days were great\u2014the family moved from the rat-infested apartment only after a woman was murdered in front of their home. But the three daughters of Puerto Rican parents were kept safe, spending most of their time in school or at the boxing gym where their father refereed. They learned how to block a punch and throw a right hook. They bickered over clothes and went to dance class and dressed up for quincean\u0303eras.","And one by one, they proved their father right: they could and they did. Ivelisse Rodriguez Simon graduated from Harvard Business School and is now a partner at a private-equity firm. Rebecca Rodriguez is the medical director of one of the best family-health clinics in the country. And Gina Rodriguez won a Best Actress Golden Globe for her starring role on Jane the Virgin.","\"We lived the idea of the American Dream,\" Gina says. \"And they made an environment where that was possible.\"","The Rodriguez Family","Left and Right: Courtesy of the Rodriguez Family","This is a story about nine American families with children, like the Rodriguez kids, who all went on to extraordinary success in different fields. The Emanuel brothers conquered medicine, politics and Hollywood. The Wojcicki sisters became scientists, CEOs and tech entrepreneurs. The Simmons brothers are a painter, a rapper and a media mogul; the Antonoffs are now a rock star and a fashion designer. The Srinivasans include a judge, a public-health official and an entrepreneur, and the Gay siblings write books and run companies and design bridges. The Dungey sisters grew into an actor and a television executive. One Lin sibling designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; the other has written 12 books.","Each of these families is different in thousands of ways, from their ethnicities to their incomes to their sleepover policies. But we set out to find the ways they are the same.","In selecting candidates to study, we ignored siblings who do the same work in the same industry (like Venus and Serena Williams) and families that come from a great fortune or legacy (like the Trumps or the Kennedys). We looked for families in which all the siblings did well. And we defined success by leadership, service or achievement, not just fame or money alone. Of course, genetics plays a role for every family, but we focused on upbringing and sibling dynamics instead.","Some of the consistencies are fairly predictable. While none of these siblings grew up rich, they were privileged in many other ways. They had involved parents and lots of opportunities, and most saw college as achievable, even inevitable. They weren\u2019t abused or neglected, and none grew up in abject want. They didn\u2019t have an unfair head start, but they were spared some of the most difficult obstacles faced by less fortunate kids.","But other commonalities are more specific, and more telling. Of the nine families, eight had a parent who was an immigrant or an educator, and five had a parent who was both. Many parents were involved in political activism of some kind. Most recall a conflict-heavy family life, but that conflict was rarely between the parents. Many had a strong awareness of mortality as children. And most said they grew up with much more freedom than their friends did.","We talked to mayors and poets and judges and rappers, Jews from Chicago and Indians from Kansas and Haitians from Nebraska. We talked to siblings together and alone, and we talked to parents where we could. Here are six striking qualities they shared.","Immigrant Drive","As Gino Rodriguez was boxing with his daughters in Chicago, Saroja Srinivasan, a Hindu who is vegetarian, was mastering the art of the hamburger. She and her husband T.P. Srinivasan settled in Lawrence, Kans., with their three small children in the early 1970s, when T.P. joined the math department at the University of Kansas. Everyone they knew was back in India.","\"We made a conscious decision that we are different enough, so we should do everything we can to make [the kids] feel part of their community,\" Saroja recalls. That meant cooking hot dogs and pizza as well as dosas and pakoras, watching the Kansas Jayhawks in a living room adorned with Indian devotional art and arranging presents under the family shrine to celebrate \"Krishmas,\" their version of Christmas.","Just like their neighbors, the three Srinivasan children\u2014Sri, Srija and \u00adSrinija\u2014played basketball and went shopping and rode dirt bikes. But they didn\u2019t have chores in the same way their friends did. In the Srinivasan household, less was required\u2014but more was expected.","There was no one person responsible for the trash or dishes. \"It was more like, \u2018Look around. What\u2019s Mom doing? Does she need help?\u2019\" recalls Srinija, the youngest. \"Put things away. Pay attention.\"","Also, nobody got an allowance. Instead, a drawer in the living-room table contained petty cash for anyone to use. \"On the one hand, it meant great permissiveness that is way better than an allowance,\" says Srinija. \"On the other hand, responsibility for every choice.\" Her older sister Srija put it this way: \"If I took $20, that meant Sri and Srinija couldn\u2019t go to the movies.\"","The Srinivasan Family","Left and Right: Courtesy of the Srinivasan Family","The three kids, now adults, say they grew up understanding that the family was more important than the individual, a realization made especially poignant by the fact that their parents had left their own families behind to immigrate to the U.S.","For the Srinivasans, that sacrifice paid off. Sri would grow up to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit; his name was floated earlier this year as a candidate for the Supreme Court. Srija is the interim deputy chief for the San Mateo County health system, responsible for public-health efforts affecting more than 700,000 Californians. And Srinija is an entrepreneur who was one of the first employees at Yahoo and now sits on the board of Stanford University.","In addition to Puerto Rico and India, the parents of these extraordinary siblings arrived from Israel, Haiti, Poland and China. For their children, the standards were unstated yet fundamental, as invisible and necessary as oxygen.","The Gay siblings, a Haitian-American trio, grew up in Nebraska. Roxane Gay is a best-selling author and New York Times opinion writer, Joel Gay is one of the youngest black CEOs ever to helm a publicly traded company (Energy Recovery), and Michael Gay Jr. is a civil engineer. Their upbringing was stricter than their friends\u2019: the kids weren\u2019t allowed to have sleepovers, they couldn\u2019t go to a friend\u2019s home unless their mother Nicole had met the parents, and one bad grade could lead to the confiscation of beloved toys. None of that was up for discussion. \"Parenting is not a democracy,\" Nicole says.","The Gay Family","Left: Courtesy of the Gay Family; Right: Cindy Hegger Photography","Awareness of the im\u00admigrant experience, compounded by the fact that the Gays were often the only black family on their block, led to tough rules and high standards. \"Success and performance was not a choice. That was an expectation,\" Michael Gay Sr. says. \"Good grades in school, that was not something to make a big fit about.\" No one received a gold star from \"General Gay and his attache\u0301, Nicole,\" as Joel calls them.","Being from Haiti in particular meant that there was a distinct honor to uphold. \"They were very proud of our history, that we were the first black nation in the western hemisphere,\" says Roxane. Adds Joel: \"The more impoverished the country from whence you come, the more emboldened one\u2019s work ethic is.\" He says his parents, and the awareness of their sacrifice, created \"an extreme intolerance for underperformance within oneself.\"","Parent-Teachers","On another university campus, far from the Srinivasans in Kansas, Esther Wojcicki was having a pool party. Her husband Stan was chair of the physics department at Stanford, and they regularly hosted barbecues for students and their families. Their daughters Susan, Janet and Anne would interrogate the guests about theoretical physics when they weren\u2019t busy passing hors d\u2019oeuvres or throwing each other in the pool.","Susan is now the CEO of YouTube, Janet is a professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the Uni\u00adversity of California, San Francisco, and Anne is a co-founder and the CEO of genetics company 23andMe. When they show up for breakfast in their childhood home on Stanford\u2019s campus, each wears a shirt that belongs to one of the others. (\"I just buy three of everything,\" says Anne, universally acknowledged as the best shopper of the bunch.) They immediately start mocking Anne for bringing her own kale to breakfast, mimicking Janet\u2019s high school cheerleading routine (Anne knows it by heart) and passing around a video of Anne dancing in a hula skirt on a family vacation. \"When you have three girls together, it was already a party,\" Janet says.","Growing up surrounded by their dad\u2019s physics buddies had its drawbacks. On their school vacations, the girls were usually dragged to physics conferences, where they would torment the world-\u00adfamous scientists. They threw paper airplanes during presentations, hurled small objects off hotel balconies and even came up with an elaborate fashion-consulting prank to trick academics into changing their ugly ties.","But the academic environment also instilled a comfort with complex ideas and a confidence in asking questions. \"Because we grew up with a lot of strong academics, I think one of the skills we have is not being intimidated,\" says Susan. \"It\u2019s never like, \u2018Oh, this person is so important, I can\u2019t challenge him.\u2019\"","The Wojcicki Family","Left: Courtesy of the Wojcicki Family; Right: Cody Pickens for TIME","Esther had begun her daughters\u2019 ed\u00aducation long before they were peppering Stanford physicists with questions about nuclear particles. After working as a teacher and playground supervisor in the 1960s, she began to suspect that early-childhood education was more crucial than anyone then thought. \"My theory was that the most important years were 0 to 5,\" she says. \"It was a gut feeling. So I made everything into a game.\" She did arts and crafts projects with her toddler daughters, took them to the library every week and taught them how to read, count and swim before they even set foot in a classroom.","Of course, developmental experts have now proved Esther right: the first few years of a child\u2019s life are among the most important for learning and brain development. And between Stan\u2019s academic universe and Esther\u2019s educational parenting, another commonality emerges: seven of the nine families had a parent who was a teacher.","Not all taught at the university level, though three families had at least one professor as a parent. The nine families also included parents who were elementary-school teachers, a preschool painting instructor, a doctor who taught medical students, a former French teacher and a school administrator who taught a night course on black history.","It may be that the job itself was less important than the educational mind-set. Parents in these families instinctively under\u00adstood the importance of at-home instruction decades before researchers established the merits of early education. Their children recalled early supplementary lessons, books read aloud, regular \u00adlibrary trips and even at-home worksheets to give them an early boost in school.","This clearly helped the Dungey sisters. ABC Entertainment Group president Channing Dungey is the first black president of a major television network, and her sister Merrin Dungey is a well-known actor, with major roles on Once Upon a Time and Alias. (She will appear on Conviction this fall.) Their mother had been an elementary-school teacher before Channing was born, and she applied her classroom skills to raising her two daughters in Sacramento. \"She would draw lines of faces, like three happy faces and one sad face, three triangles and one square, and then there\u2019s my little crayon marks marking the one that was wrong,\" recalls Channing, who learned to read when she was 2 years old. \"We never went to preschool, because we didn\u2019t have to,\" Merrin adds.","The Dungey Family","Left and Right: Courtesy of the Dungey Family","For the Srinivasans, having a parent who was an educator created an unspoken expectation of academic achievement that was almost as powerful as familial love. \"You probably have somewhere in the back of your mind that you don\u2019t want to disappoint your teachers in the same way you don\u2019t want to disappoint your parents,\" says Sri. \"There was just no other way to think.\"","Political Activism","On most nights, the three Emanuel boys would adjourn their ritual fistfight and flop on their mother\u2019s bed to hear a story. But sometimes she didn\u2019t come home: Marsha Emanuel was occasionally arrested as she demonstrated against segregation in 1960s Chicago. On those nights, the boys bickered over the top bunk while Marsha waited behind bars.","The Emanuels would go on to become the stuff of legend and are often called the Jewish Kennedys: bioethicist Zeke is a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania, a former Obama Administration official and one of the main architects of the Affordable Care Act; Rahm is the mayor of Chicago and a former chief of staff to President Obama; and Ari created William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood.","Between their mother\u2019s civil rights work, their pediatrician father\u2019s campaign against lead paint and their grandfather\u2019s union loyalties, the three rowdy youngsters couldn\u2019t escape political awareness even if they tried. \"If we did not go with her to a particular protest, that protest was brought home,\" Rahm recalls, sitting in the briefing room of the Chicago mayor\u2019s office. \"Just eating dinner was a test of current events.\" (The brothers also have a much younger, adopted sister, Shoshana.)","Video by Diane Tsai for TIME","That political engagement created a sense that the world was malleable and that the boys, through their actions, could be the ones to shape it. \"You could, by protesting or coming up with ideas, actually change the world. I think that\u2019s a very important message,\" says Zeke. \"It\u2019s not that it will change necessarily, but the world can change, and that you have a responsibility to try to make a change.\"","Political activism was a common theme for the parents in these families. Many of them were outspoken in their demands for reform in cities, schools and housing complexes, and never just for the benefit of their own children. While none of the parents held high political office, their involvement ranged from demonstrating for civil rights to union organizing to demanding that cities build new parks or that universities treat low-wage workers fairly. When they weren\u2019t pushing for reform, they were mediating heated political debates at home.","The Emanuel Family","Left: Courtesy of the Emanuel Family; Right: Brooke Collins\u2014City of Chicago","Daniel Simmons Sr. also found himself arrested during civil rights demonstrations. He worked as a New York City school-attendance superintendent by day and taught a college course on black history by night. His young sons remember waving goodbye as he boarded a bus from Queens to see Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington in 1963. They stood with him on picket lines and visited his class on radical politics, and they were watching when he lay down in front of a bulldozer to protest a segregated construction site. Now adults, they say their father\u2019s activism showed them how to get involved in the world outside themselves.","\"He had his own moral compass. He knew what was right and what was fair, and he demanded that kind of justice,\" says Russell Simmons of his father. \"It stuck with me. It stuck by all my brothers as well. It\u2019s part of our makeup.\"","ControlLed Chaos","Another thing the Simmons brothers had in common with the Emanuels: they knew how to throw a punch. Growing up in heroin-ridden Hollis, Queens, in the 1970s, Danny and Russell once survived a street fight against 12 other guys. Occasionally, they\u2019d bring the fighting home. \"One time Danny took a comb and ran it through my hair, and it hurt real bad,\" says the youngest brother, Joseph, known as Rev Run. \"I think he was high.\"","Their father didn\u2019t try to shield his sons from all violence. \"He respected what you learned in the culture in the street,\" says Russell. \"So he never really hid us from the stuff that was right on our corner.\" That exposure also created motivation. \"Seeing tragedy always pushes you to move past it,\" says Danny, the oldest, who beat heroin addiction decades ago.","Video by Diane Tsai for TIME","Not all kids from tough neighbor\u00adhoods make it out. But Russell is now a multimillionaire entrepreneur, a co-founder of Def Jam Recordings and the chairman and CEO of Rush Communications. Danny is a painter and author who co-created Def Poetry Jam on HBO with Russell and oversees the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation. And Rev Run was one-third of the hip-hop trio Run-D.M.C. in the 1980s and \u201990s and is now an ordained minister and reality-\u00adTV star.","The Simmons brothers grew up closer to raw, systemic violence than most families in this story. But even outside Hollis, some of the families (especially those with boys) recalled a household dynamic that resembled a fight club. With a few notable exceptions, most described a sibling dynamic that was wildly competitive at best and physically violent at worst. They grew up in controlled chaos: heavy on conflict, light on manners and indifferent to standards of appropriate behavior.","Few recalled major rifts between their parents. But many of these siblings said they regularly fought with their brothers and sisters over everything from clothing to board games to who had to sit in the middle seat on long car trips. Zeke Emanuel puts it this way: \"If there wasn\u2019t blood, it was a good night.\"","Mealtime debates could get so vicious, they horrified outsiders. Joel Gay recalls that his wife was on the verge of tears when she first had dinner with his family. \"She said, \u2018I have never seen anything like that. Why are you screaming at each other?\u2019\" he remembers. \"If you don\u2019t under\u00adstand Haitian culture, you can think we\u2019re actually fighting.\"","The Simmons Family","Left: Courtesy of the Simmons Family; Right: Anthony Behar\u2014Sipa Press\/AP","Some of the rowdy behavior sounds like normal, run-of-the-mill mischief. Roxane and Joel Gay pushed their baby brother Michael down the stairs in a laundry basket. Susan and Janet Wojcicki loved to trick a young Anne into approaching strangers and calling them \"fat.\" Gina Rodriguez once put glue in her sister Rebecca\u2019s milk.","They committed all the venial sins of American teenagers, and some of the cardinal ones as well. Across the nine families, there were incidents of teenage parenthood, smoking pot, underage drinking, cutting school, bar fights, shoplifting and drag racing. At least two had parties when their parents weren\u2019t home. Esther Wojcicki says she found out about her daughters\u2019 secret house party only when a student came to school wearing clothes pilfered from her own closet. (Her daughters dispute that particular anecdote.)","For some of these siblings, growing up in a constant state of trial-by-\u00adcombat made them tougher. For others, the bad behavior was a symptom of their willingness to make mistakes, an anti-\u00adperfectionism that hardened into resilience. It wasn\u2019t just that they fought; it was that they fought and then moved on. \"We were called a lot of bad names, and we had to withstand that and continue to go on,\" says Zeke Emanuel. \"That breeds a certain kind of toughness.\"","And though few openly admit it, sibling rivalry can motivate achievement, says New York University psychologist Ben Dattner: \"Winning the Nobel Prize is a more civilized way of beating the crap out of your brother.\"","LESSONS IN MORTALITY","Jack and Rachel Antonoff can\u2019t describe their childhood without discussing the third Antonoff: their younger sister Sarah, who died of a brain tumor when she was 13.","Jack is a Grammy-winning musician who is the lead singer of Bleachers and lead guitarist of fun., now on hiatus. Rachel is a New York City\u2013based fashion de\u00adsigner. They\u2019re unlike many of the other eight families: their parents aren\u2019t immigrants or educators, nobody in their family cared much about politics, and they didn\u2019t break rules, because there weren\u2019t any rules to break. Instead, since their sister\u2019s death more than a decade ago, the Antonoffs say they\u2019re motivated by a constant awareness of their own mortality.","\"When you hear about a movie coming out that you\u2019re excited to see, do you not think every time, Oh, I hope I\u2019m still alive?\" Rachel asks, sitting in the Los Angeles studio where Jack is recording his latest album. Jack nods, digging into a cupcake in honor of his 32nd birthday. \"I have to get my gallbladder out, and I don\u2019t want to do it until this record is done in case I die on the table,\" he says. \"Everything backs up to the amount of work I do before I die. That creates a work ethic. There\u2019s an urgency.\"","The Antonoff Family","Left: Courtesy of the Antonoff Family; Right: Amy Lombard","Posttraumatic growth is a tricky concept. For many kids and even adults, a loss of this magnitude may cause permanent devastation, not motivation. And yet while the Antonoffs experienced a loss significantly more shattering than most, many of the other eight families also experienced a brush with untimely death. The woman who was shot in the head in front of the Rodriguezes\u2019 home was their cousin. The Simmons brothers saw friends and neighbors killed by drugs, AIDS and gang violence. Rahm Emanuel nearly died as a teenager when a deep cut in his finger developed into a bone infection. (He ended up losing half his finger.)","Such experiences can fuel ambition. After spending weeks in the hospital battling that life-threatening infection, Rahm says, he transformed from a slacker student into a go-getter. \"I made sure that given how close I came to dying, that I was never, ever going to not get the most out of everything I was doing,\" he says. \"I was a changed person.\"","It can also help a family get their priorities straight. Jack and Rachel\u2019s mother Shira Antonoff said Sarah\u2019s death drowned out all the petty judgments and expectations of their suburban New Jersey community. She let her kids skip school, she didn\u2019t insist they finish college, and she took Jack to get his lip pierced at age 15, to the shock and dismay of other mothers in the grocery store.","\"The core was, We\u2019ve had a sick kid, we\u2019ve had a kid who\u2019s died, so let\u2019s get real about what\u2019s important here,\" Shira says. \"You\u2019ve got to find a path in life that you\u2019re really happy with.\"","a free-range childhood","Like many of the other siblings in this story, Tan and Maya Lin grew up on a university campus, were raised by immigrant parents and bickered constantly over board games. They were also allowed to do practically anything they wanted. You could say it was the opposite of helicopter parenting.","Their father Henry Huan Lin had been forced to take calligraphy classes while growing up in China, an experience he loathed so much that it informed his parenting philosophy. \"He promised that when he had kids, they would never have to do anything they didn\u2019t want to do,\" Maya says.","And so the Lin parents, who fled Mao and ultimately became professors at Ohio University, didn\u2019t monitor their children\u2019s homework or force them to join sports teams or push them to learn the piano. \"We were given all sorts of freedom to do whatever we wanted,\" recalls Tan, now a poet and the author of a dozen books. Maya, an artist and architect who designed the Vietnam Veterans \u00adMemorial, puts it this way: \"They were the anti\u2013dragon parents.\"","The Lin Family","Left and Right: Courtesy of the Lin Family","The Lin siblings spent most of their time outside, or writing poems, or throwing clay in the university ceramics studio. They went to a high school with an open-module system, which meant that sometimes they went to class only two days a week. \"I\u2019ve only ever chafed when there are rules,\" Maya says.","Few of the siblings in this story had parents who closely monitored their movements, and many said they were raised with significantly more freedom than their friends. By the standards of today\u2019s helicopter parents, they ran wild. The Dungey sisters rode all over Sacramento on their bikes alone. The Antonoffs were allowed to skip school whenever they wanted. Six-year-old Zeke Emanuel regularly escorted 4-year-old Rahm home from nursery school on a Chicago city bus.","\"She was a supporter of us, but she didn\u2019t tell us what to do, and she allowed us to play and develop our own ideas,\" says Zeke of his mother. \"She didn\u2019t even worry too much whether they were safe or not.\"","Esther Wojcicki taught her daughters to swim as soon as they could walk, specifically so that she wouldn\u2019t have to watch them when they played near the backyard pool. \"I empowered them early, because I wanted to make sure they could take care of themselves,\" she says. \"They could read early, so they could read signs. They could do math early, so they could handle money.\"","Even by the comparatively lax stan\u00addards of the 1970s, the Wojcicki girls had more freedom than most. Five-year-old Susan was often left to babysit 4-year-old Janet and infant Anne, and local mothers raised their eyebrows when the girls rode their bikes alone to the dime store a mile away.","But Esther has a theory. \"The more you do for your kids, the less they do for themselves, and the less empowered they feel,\" she says.","Thousands of extraordinary families flourish across America, and the new generation of hyperaware parents may raise thousands more. But none of the parents in this story set out to raise successful children. Instead, the six commonalities of our nine families combined to create drive, grit and social consciousness that propelled all the siblings on their own chosen paths.","\"You cannot reach anybody\u2019s goal. You\u2019ve got to reach your own goal,\" says Gino Rodriguez. \"You cannot reach a goal unless you set that goal for yourself.\" That\u2019s why I can and I will are five words without an object, a push without direction.

Albuquerque is celebrating the one year anniversary of the city\u2019s successful \"There\u2019s a Better Way\" program. (Albuquerque Mayor's Office)","Republican Mayor Richard Berry was driving around Albuquerque last year when he saw a man on a street corner holding a sign that read: \"Want a Job. Anything Helps.\"","Throughout his administration, as part of a push to connect the homeless population to services, Berry had taken to driving through the city to talk to panhandlers about their lives. His city\u2019s poorest residents told him they didn\u2019t want to be on the streets begging for money, but they didn\u2019t know where else to go.","Seeing that sign gave Berry an idea. Instead of asking them, many of whom feel dispirited, to go out looking for work, the city could bring the work to them.","Next month will be the first anniversary of Albuquerque\u2019s There\u2019s a Better Way program, which hires panhandlers for day jobs beautifying the city. In partnership with a local nonprofit that serves the homeless population, a van is dispatched around the city to pick up panhandlers who are interested in working. The job pays $9 an hour, which is above minimum wage, and provides a lunch. At the end of the shift, the participants are offered overnight shelter as needed.","In less than a year since its start, the program has given out 932 jobs clearing 69,601 pounds of litter and weeds from 196 city blocks. And more than 100 people have been connected to permanent employment.","\"You can just see the spiral they\u2019ve been on to end up on the corner. Sometimes it takes a little catalyst in their lives to stop the downward spiral, to let them catch their breath, and it\u2019s remarkable,\" Berry said in an interview. \"They\u2019ve had the dignity of work for a day; someone believed in them today.\"","Panhandlers are hired to beautify the city. (City of Albuquerque Mayor\u2019s Office)","Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A Berry\u2019s effort is a shift from the movement across the country to criminalize panhandling. A recent National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty report found a noticeable increase, with 24 percent of cities banning it altogether and 76 percent banning it in particular areas.","There is a persisting stigma that people begging for money are either drug addicts or too lazy to work and are looking for an easy handout.","But that\u2019s not necessarily the reality. Panhandling is not especially lucrative, but for some people it can seem as if it\u2019s the only option. When they\u2019ve been approached in Albuquerque with the offer of work, most have been eager for the opportunity to earn money, Berry said. They just needed a lift. One man told him no one had said a kind word to him in 25 years.","Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin\u2019s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city\u2019s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level. Kellie Tillerson, director of Employment Services at St. Martin\u2019s Hospitality Center, the organization that facilitates the city\u2019s program, said the way to dispel people of the negative associations with panhandlers is for them to do what the mayor did and engage on a human level.","\"Genuinely ask why they are in the predicament they are,\" Tillerson said. \"Many have medical conditions, they don\u2019t have the proper identification \u2014 you can\u2019t get a job without one. They don\u2019t have a Social Security card. Those little things we take for granted prohibit people from getting a job. Don\u2019t assume they are lazy.\"","The There\u2019s a Better Way van employs about 10 workers a day but could easily take more. When the van fills, people have begged to get a spot next time, she said. That\u2019s why the city has increased funding for the program to expand it from two to four days a week. And it inspired St. Martin\u2019s to start its own day labor program, connecting the jobless to employers in the area who could offer side jobs.","Tillerson said a lot of the people who get picked up by the van were not aware of all the services available to them. One man who recently got out of prison returned to St. Martin\u2019s the day after taking one of the city\u2019s jobs. She said it enrolled him in the day-labor program, told him about behavioral health services and are helping him get an ID.","\"He now has a support system he didn\u2019t know he needed and definitely didn\u2019t know existed,\" she said. \"It\u2019s life-changing for them. He was one that said, \u2018I would much rather earn my money than have someone hand it to me.\u2019 \"","Dozens of cities around the country have reached out to Berry wanting to copy the program. It\u2019s a testament, he said, to the work mayors do regardless of political party.","He was the first Republican mayor elected in Albuquerque in 30 years, and he\u2019s proactively tackling homelessness.","The program hasn\u2019t weeded out all panhandling in the city, and supporters say that\u2019s not really the point. It\u2019s connecting people who would otherwise not seek help to needed services. And it\u2019s showing them when they are at their lowest that they have real value, and that others are willing to show them kindness to help them have a better life.","\"It\u2019s helping hundreds of people,\" Berry said, \"and our city is more beautiful than ever.\""],"targetTitle":"This Republican mayor has an incredibly simple idea to help the homeless.

{"postId":"379654200898363392","postText":["Is this deadly drug becoming a problem in American schools?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["By Julia Rubin","\"What have I become?\" 23-year-old Andrew Jones asked his mom shortly before he died. \"What's happened to me?\" A star high school athlete who went on to play Division I football for Missouri State University, Andrew was an honors student whom friends described as outgoing, charismatic, and loyal. He was also a heroin addict.","Never even a recreational drug user, Andrew had been the first to discourage friends at his Catholic high school from smoking pot. But his story is frighteningly typical of the current heroin epidemic among suburban American youth. It's an issue made all the more timely by the recent heroin-related death of Glee star Cory Monteith, best known and beloved for playing squeaky-clean high school football star Finn Hudson.","What Cory and Andrew expose is that heroin isn't at all what it used to be. Not only is the drug much more powerful than before (purity can be as high as 90 percent) but it's also no longer limited to the dirty-needle, back-alley experience so many of us picture. Now it's as easy as purchasing a pill, because that's what heroin has become: a powder-filled capsule known as a button, designed to be broken open and snorted, that can be purchased for just $10. And it regularly is\u2014on varsity sports teams, on Ivy League campuses, and in safe suburban neighborhoods.","During his sophomore year of college, Andrew fell ill from a virus that left him with pancreas damage. Soon after that, he broke his hand. Add in routine wisdom teeth surgery, and Andrew was swimming in prescription painkillers. He became addicted. \"He would steal them, he would buy them, he would find them wherever he could,\" remembers his friend, 26-year-old Missouri native Katie Gerstenkorn. \"He stole painkillers from me, actually.\"","When Andrew was given a capsule of heroin at a party, he was instantly hooked. According to Dan Duncan, associate executive director at St. Louis's National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse (NCADA), most heroin users start with pain pills as Andrew did. It's no wonder: In an interview with 60 Minutes last year, National Institute on Drug Abuse director Dr. Nora Volkow dropped the eye-opening statistic that in a country of 312 million people, 210 million prescriptions for opiate medications were written in 2011 alone. But pain pills are expensive\u2014legally and on the black market\u2014pushing those dependent on them to seek out a cheaper, more easily accessible alternative with a similar kind of high: heroin.","Andrew went to his parents for help. \"He couldn't get away from the drug,\" says his mom, Pam. \"It's a hunger, it's a thirst. You throw all your morals out the window.\" Before long, he was caught stealing money from his roommates so he could buy more. After a stint in rehab, an overdose, and another stint in rehab, it looked like he was finally starting to get a handle on his addiction. Like Cory Monteith, Andrew was doing his best to clean up\u2014and everyone in his life believed he could do it. Until the overdose that killed him.","In 2008 Duncan and his NCADA staff started getting an influx of calls about heroin to their help line. \"It wasn't just that we were getting calls about heroin\u2014we were getting calls about heroin and teens specifically,\" he says. \"It became clear that this was a problem in some of the best high schools in the area. Public, private, most of them.\" By 2010, the year Andrew died, the number of calls about heroin had exploded. \"The thing that was most startling was the average age of the deaths from heroin overdoses,\" says St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch. \"Historically the age for most heroin deaths has been in the 40-to-45 range. But now the average age is between eighteen and 25.\"","For some, heroin abuse starts even earlier. At fourteen, Emily* was a high school freshman who had just made the varsity cheerleading squad. By fifteen, she was a regular heroin user. Despite her habit, Emily was able to maintain a facade at school, getting good grades and staying out of trouble. \"It was like I was leading a double life,\" she says. \"I thought, Maybe this is my little secret, and it's not as bad as everyone says it is.\"","At first, she did it only on weekends with a friend of a friend's older brother. He would provide the drug for free but quickly began pressuring her to have sex with him. Eventually she caved. \"I slept with him because I felt like he was giving something to me, so I had to give something to him,\" she admits. \"Looking back on it, my self-esteem was so low, and that's why I was doing all these things.\" Her supplier was 30 years old.","Emily started skipping school, and then didn't try out for cheerleading the next year. Doing heroin became part of her daily routine. When a friend wanted to try it for her sixteenth birthday, Emily realized heroin wasn't her little secret anymore\u2014it was something other kids at her school were doing too.","Over the course of two years, she entered treatment six times, overdosed on heroin twice, and ran away from home. Emily was thrown out of a hotel and a homeless shelter after that. She returned home and attended twelve-step meetings, but continued to use. Finally a switch flipped. \"I was willing to go to any length to get high, and then it became clear that I needed to go to any length to get sober.

","It also means painting your nails cute colors, feeling the grass beneath your soles, and enjoying the cool breeze on your toes.","But it also means that you might become more aware of the less cute aspects of your feet...","After years of wear and tear, being stuffed in shoes, and holding up your whole self, everyone\u2019s feet develop rough patches and bumps. This is normal and natural, but it\u2019s not always pleasant.","While calluses typically only look unpleasant and feel rough to the touch, corns \u2014 which are hard, rounded types of calluses \u2014 can be painful when pressure is applied, such as when walking or wearing a shoe.","It can also make you self-conscious if you\u2019re walking around barefoot or in shoes that leave your feet mostly exposed.","And since there\u2019s a lot of evidence that shows going barefoot is really good for your overall health, you\u2019ll definitely want to show off your tootsies this summer.","But if you have corns, calluses, or other rough, hard skin on your feet? Never fear. There are simple, inexpensive, and all-natural ways to smooth your feet and get them soft and ready to show off, and you can do them all right at home.","And of course, this isn\u2019t just for feet, so if you have corns or calluses elsewhere, like on your hands, you can try these remedies there, too.","Read on to learn how to make your feet summer-ready, and then break out some nail polish and wiggle your toes!","What Is A Callus?","A callus is a thick, tough area of skin that forms in response to repeated and regular friction or pressure. Your body builds up a callus to protect your skin.","Most people have calluses on their hands and feet caused by walking, holding a pen, or other activity.","Calluses might be unsightly, but they\u2019re typically harmless and painless.","What Are Corns?","A corn is actually a type of callus. It\u2019s a round bump of hard, dead skin and is usually found on the thin skin of your body, like the tops of your fingers and toes.","Like a callus, corns form where the skin regularly rubs against something, like where the knuckles of your toes run against the top of your shoes.","Unlike a callus, corns are often painful due to being a hard, ball-like shape that digs in, rather than a broader surface.","So, if you have issues with corns and calluses, what can you do?","Remedy #1: Apple Cider Vinegar And Castor Oil","In a bowl or basin of hot, soapy water, add 1 cup apple cider vinegar and soak your feet.","This will soften calluses enough to file down with a pumice stone. For corns, rub a dab of castor oil on each one after each soak.","Do this daily, and your feet will be soft and smooth in about 10 days.","A word about filing down calluses: Be gentle. It will take longer, but rubbing hard with a pumice stone will actually just make the callus worse.","Remedy #2: Vitamin E Or Vitamin A","While they\u2019re meant to be taken internally, you can also topically use the gel inside of vitamin capsules by breaking them open and squeezing a bit out.","Rubbing the oil inside a vitamin E or vitamin A capsule is a great treatment for corns.","Rub the contents of a capsule on a corn before going to bed, then cover with a clean cotton sock.","Do this every night until the corn disappears.","Remedy #3: Lemon Peel","Slice off a piece of lemon peel the width of the toe with the corn on it.","Press it pith-side down on the corn and secure with a bandage. Keep everything in place with a clean cotton sock and wear overnight.","Repeat every night until the corn is gone.","Remedy #4: Onion And White Vinegar","Like the lemon peel, a piece of onion soaked for about a day in white vinegar, secured to the foot and left on overnight, also breaks down corns.","But be forewarned that the smell will be much stronger!","Just like the lemon peel, the vinegar-soaked onion piece should be attached with a bandage, covered with a sock, and left on overnight.","Remedy #5: Bread And Apple Cider Vinegar","Half a slice of stale bread soaked in apple cider vinegar is a great way to get rid of a callus that takes up a large area, like across the heel or ball of your foot.","Attach the soaked piece of bread to the foot with some plastic wrap to make sure it doesn\u2019t leak, and then cover with a sock.","The callus will be softened and ready to file, or gone completely by morning.","Remedy #6: Castor Oil","This remedy can be done during the day and worn under socks and shoes as you go about your business. It\u2019s also great for corns on small, hard-to-bandage places.","Take a non-medicated corn pad and place around the corn. Dab a few drops of castor oil onto the corn, and then cover with some adhesive tape to keep everything in place.","If you\u2019re wearing socks, wear old ones in case the oil leaks.","Remedy #7: Aspirin","Crush about five uncoated aspirin tablets into powder, and mix with equal parts apple cider vinegar and water to form a paste.","Rub the paste generously onto a corn or callus, and wrap with a bandage to hold in place.","Leave the paste on for at least 10 minutes, then rub the corn or callus with a pumice stone, and it should come off."],"targetTitle":"Wrap Your Feet In Bread And Saran Wrap To Naturally Remove Yucky Corns And Calluses","targetDescription":"Summertime means sandals \u2014 at least, when you absolutely\u00a0have to wear shoes at all!

Guess who\u2019s winning?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Tim Connor stands by a sign his neighbor purchased to thwart commuters from cutting through their quiet residential street in Takoma Park, Md. (Evelyn Hockstein\/For The Washington Post)","When the traffic on Timothy Connor\u2019s quiet Maryland street suddenly jumped by several hundred cars an hour, he knew who was partly to blame: the disembodied female voice he could hear through the occasional open window saying, \"Continue on Elm Avenue . . . .\"","The marked detour around a months-long road repair was several blocks away. But plenty of drivers were finding a shortcut past Connor\u2019s Takoma Park house, slaloming around dog walkers and curbside basketball hoops, thanks to Waze and other navigation apps.","\"I could see them looking down at their phones,\" said Connor, a water engineer at a federal agency. \"We had traffic jams, people were honking. It was pretty harrowing.\"","And so Connor borrowed a tactic he read about from the car wars of Southern California and other traffic-weary regions: He became a Waze impostor. Every rush hour, he went on the Google-owned social-media app and posted false reports of a wreck, speed trap or other blockage on his street, hoping to deflect some of the flow.","He continued his guerrilla counterattack for two weeks before the app booted him off, apparently detecting a saboteur in its ranks. That made Connor a casualty in the social-media skirmishes erupting across the country as neighborhoods try to contend with suddenly savvy drivers finding their way on routes that were once all but secret.","Waze is a navigation app that uses user-collected data to calculate the quickest and safest routes to user's destinations. Here's what you need to know about the app. (Jhaan Elker\/The Washington Post)","[A warning left on a nanny\u2019s car. License plates stolen. And a Pentagon official in big trouble]","\"It used to be that only locals knew all the cut-through routes, but Google Maps and Waze are letting everyone know,\" said Bates Mattison, a city councilman in the Atlanta suburb of Brookhaven, Ga. \"In some extreme cases, we have to address it to preserve the sanctity of a residential neighborhood.\"","When population growth began to overwhelm a set of major intersections in his district, there was an increase of 45,000 cars a day on some residential streets, as app-armed commuters fought their way to nearby Interstate 85. In response, the city is posting signs to restrict left or right turns at key intersections.","The apps didn\u2019t create the traffic, Mattison said, but they gave drivers options they wouldn\u2019t have known about otherwise.","Waze, with 50 million users worldwide, provides navigation guidance by combining its map database with data it collects in real time from every logged-on driver. Average speed, backups and fleeting hazards such as a car pulled over to change a flat appear almost instantly on the app\u2019s cartoonish interface. When the first Waze-enabled car finds its way to a promising shortcut, thousands can follow.","In Portland, Ore., for example, when drivers trying to avoid local construction began flooding a street that had been redesigned as a \"greenway\" bike route, city officials had to put up barrels on some stretches to filter out the vehicular through-traffic. It worked.","\"The apps reacted pretty quickly to that,\" said Jonathan Maus, publisher of Bikeportland.org.","In California, where navigation apps are as common to drivers as sunglasses, several communities are contending with overwhelmed local streets that residents blame at least in part on the programs. In the Los Angeles region, Waze\u2019s biggest U.S. market, a City Council person representing Sherman Oaks is considering a motion asking the programs to exclude some small residential streets from their algorithms.","It was here that Connor learned that some Waze warriors had launched concerted campaigns to fool the app. Neighbors filed false reports of blockages, sometimes with multiple users reporting the same issue to boost their credibility. But Waze was way ahead of them.","[A Marine fights to prove he\u2019s innocent of sexual misconduct. Then a lost cellphone is found.]","It\u2019s not possible to fool the system for long, according to Waze officials. For one thing, the system knows if you\u2019re not actually in motion. More important, it constantly self-corrects, based on data from other drivers.","\"The nature of crowdsourcing is that if you put in a fake accident, the next 10 people are going to report that it\u2019s not there,\" said Julie Mossler, Waze\u2019s head of communications. The company will suspend users they suspect of \"tampering with the map,\" she said.","Waze\u2019s mission is to distribute traffic more efficiently across the grid of public streets, Mossler said, not to create traffic jams.","\"That said, the traffic has to go somewhere,\" she said. Although the app will continue to route drivers down any legal street, Waze programmers are working to build in alerts about school zones and other slow-speed zones, Mossler said.","Traffic engineers say the side street flare-ups are a downside to the otherwise positive effect that navigation apps can have on vehicle flow.","They have proved to be a powerful force in moving cars past bottlenecks, and in many jurisdictions, including Maryland and the District, officials have begun working directly with Waze to glean information about potholes, backups and other real-time data.","The cut-through disputes \"are an unintended consequence of this great technology that is supposed to help people avoid sitting in traffic,\" said Paul Silberman, a traffic engineer with Sabra, Wang & Associates in Columbia, Md.","Those who live on side streets have been complaining for years about becoming through routes, but now it\u2019s happening at Internet speed.","\"These great shortcuts used to spread by word of mouth, but now they just spread like wildfire,\" Silberman said.","[Three workers once died rebuilding this bridge. Now a new makeover is under way.]","In Takoma Park, Connor complained to the city\u2019s public works and police departments, but nothing stemmed the flow. He put out two plastic watch-for-children figures, but one was hit by a car and the other was stolen.","Connor and his neighbors put up \"No Through Traffic\" signs. And their city councilman, Tim Male, tried to get Google Maps to take note of the official detour, by calling the company and flagging it through the apps\u2019 feedback feature.","But still they came. One afternoon, Connor counted a vehicle every two seconds on a street with a single lane available between parked cars. One morning, neighbors awoke to a cacophony of honks and went out to find a backup dozens of cars deep, two drivers in the middle about to come to blows.","Soon after, Connor went rogue. He experimented with Waze, confirmed it was sending drivers down his street and began filing his false reports.","\"It didn\u2019t do much and within two weeks they stopped showing up on the map all together,\" Connor said. \"They were on to me.\"","The traffic flow began to wane when the road construction ended, Connor said, but remains three or four times higher than before it began. For some drivers, their app-inspired shortcut became a permanent route."],"targetTitle":"Traffic-weary homeowners and Waze are at war, again.

What that data showed was that 7 of the top 10 and 12 of the top 20 cities most inclined to binge are in the state of Wisconsin.","Now, as someone who still answers \"Wisconsin\" to the question \"Where are you from?\" I am familiar with the stereotypes of camouflage-coated ice fisherman slamming Millers on frigid January afternoons (or mornings), but this analysis went somewhat deeper than that.

Regardless, having nearly 27 percent of the adults in your town claim they drink to excess as they do in Appleton, is not a stat that will likely go up on any welcome signs you\u2019d see at the city limits.

{"postId":"5335sr","postText":["Does Sparkling Water Have a Downside?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Plain seltzer or sparkling water\u2019s lack of sugar, calories, added colors or artificial flavors and its relatively low acidity makes it a generally healthy choice compared to most beverage options on the market, including most sodas, juices and sports drinks. But check the product label to avoid added sweeteners or sodium or other additives.","Seltzer is water that has had pressurized carbon dioxide added to give it bubbles. Sparkling water is the umbrella term for carbonated water, including naturally carbonated sparkling mineral water and artificially carbonated seltzer and club soda. Studies have not shown ill health effects from drinking seltzer or other plain sparkling waters.","2006 study found an association between drinking colas and low bone mineral density. But the association was not seen in those who drank other carbonated beverages.","Colas, with their low pH (a measure of acidity), also have the potential to erode tooth enamel. But a study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Dental Association found that the pH of plain sparkling water, about 5, is not low enough to erode enamel.","Carbonation does not in itself lead to dental erosion, said Dr. John Ruby, an adjunct professor of pediatric dentistry at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, who co-authored the paper. \"It\u2019s when they add citric acid or phosphoric acid that\u2019s in your classic soft drinks that the pH can drop below the critical pH of 4, where you then can have dental erosion as an outcome. For example, Coca-Cola has a pH of about 2.4,\" making it potentially over 100 times more erosive than sparkling water (because pH is on a logarithmic scale).","Bottled seltzers that have been flavored with citric acid, the acid found naturally in citrus fruits like lemons and limes, may be acidic enough to damage enamel. But you can get flavor in a less acidic form by adding a slice of lemon or lime (or other fruits, vegetables or herbs, such as cucumber, mint or basil) to plain sparkling water.","According to a spokesman from the American Dental Association, the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water. In-home sparkling water makers, such as SodaStream, have gained popularity in recent years because they save money and have environmental benefits, but an additional advantage of making your own sparkling water from the tap may be the fluoride, which the ADA emphasizes is essential for maintaining long-term oral health.","An additional health note: Club soda, which contains added sodium to mimic the taste of mineral water, is not the same as seltzer. The amount of sodium can be small and varies by brand, but it can add up if consuming many servings. Too much sodium can increase blood pressure, and current sodium levels among most Americans are already considered too high."],"targetTitle":"Does Sparkling Water Have a Downside?","targetDescription":"A reader asks: Are there any health drawbacks to drinking seltzer?","targetKeywords":"Citrus Fruits,Fluorides,Salt,Soft Drinks,Teeth and Dentistry,Water,Ask Well,Eat,Featured","targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/82813fd3272b859fc67d9687c5498ea7e529c5cc.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/0dd7636a2121dc396cc8cb276dbd08ca62d838d5.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/1d6492d7cc03bd7103bebed3a4cecb232b84bb5a.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/359f69a052ac23f7e66cea2a7d654f254e31734e.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/e40a3b42e7638ea68d868062d9967c16d1e161de.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/abadd39ea66f96bd4879ea5495fadc0eacb2bf9a.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/be568edc1c9e2e8f9731a61052cd6af16731b072.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/08b6eaaf92d9e53c2f0176c451ae9d369f7c3810.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/345f80c79074b6ca3adf10ca8617396ae28c2675.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/e1d1fb6b4175cc30ba262d9fe2a960e43b9a19e5.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/6142502063207c06ab03b9d5f2b33b6bcabdae66.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhBQAFAIAAAMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAAFAAUAAAIEhI+pWAA7","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/d4e0001e621a2109557260bd5b92032ceb71bdb6.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/e7eeb888d82bf487c8ee9362fa1e2e0ccc283652.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/348b7c5c2c61776424e2646a6987361b4ebe2522.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/cd0dddbd0c5963423cc7957bc89042974157bb87.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/f094bb4f9ba7375d1c20110a92aa506e26d7d134\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/5248933ab22e6b5cb67724350d4d457d94ffc520.png","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/b2fe7a0fb9e827d7c053ff3a674920a00504613c.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/245c0c8be8e63bf7368544aad153019f0148f45f.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/7e97452fdc45d6fcea8aa8adb68a37995f673815.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/08c27b6a67553cce8b1b3b595e979c7089622c49.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/b4ecbdc0da373a4983e8404d792a15e82d7d3e18.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/856dfc5eff885af955055ebc17a4b279aa013c2a.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/f04f6a7b36308c2737f9b1c5f5e9b65010292b29.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/a8067cce482dae1ffb15715936ddcb42e56d4def.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/1d5dc6192f9b2e93bcc9b36c9194f553c0367ce4.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/8f0759e170238d40a8c7d02497d8b4ce58ded875.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/30f852a8ba204af44353ce51566dfb678d37e342.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC\/89462d236dcaf9c59212de3fc3246a6bb414d022.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/7IdyC","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"No.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["the greatest potential health drawback of consuming bottled sparkling water is missing out on the benefit of fluoride when you drink it instead of fluoridated tap water"],"spoilerPositions":[[[6,63],[6,231]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":136}

{"postId":"824674767202557952","postText":["How this 27-year-old made $1 million last year:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In December 2012, when Michelle Schroeder-Gardner graduated with an MBA, she had $38,000 in student loan debt.","She got a job as a financial analyst earning $50,000 a year (plus bonuses of about $12,500 annually), but she set a goal of paying off her debt within six months.","Though it took her one extra month, paying off a huge amount of debt in a short period of time set her on a path of financial over-achievement.","Since then, she has increased her income each year.","In 2013, excluding her salary from her full-time job, which she quit that year, she earned $117,000.","In 2014, that increased to $164,000.","In 2015, her earnings jumped to $321,000.","And last year, she made just shy of $1 million   $979,000, to be exact.","Plus, the 27-year-old is a digital nomad. She and her husband live in an RV, chasing 70-degree weather (they were in Arizona when we spoke in late January) and enjoying the views of a slew of national parks including Colorado National Monument, Mesa Verde, Rocky Mountain, Arches, Moab, and others.","Her ticket out of debt and into financial freedom has been her blog, Making Sense of Cents, where she offers tips on saving and making money   and publishes income reports.","Michelle Schroeder-Gardner of the Making Sense of Cents blog and her husband, Wesley Gardner (Courtesy of Michelle Schroeder-Gardner)","It also doesn't hurt that she is naturally frugal. Even though I make $100,000 a month, I'll still wear my favorite shirt even if it has a hole in it, she says.","But the biggest reason for her success may be her internal drive.","I've always been super competitive, she says. I would always win at a board game or jump rope the most, little things like that, and people would often joke, Michelle's going to be president one day, or Michelle's going to be a millionaire one day, because I was always so competitive, determined, and independent. Her friends and family also thought she would be successful because she always helped others with their problems.","Growing up, I was always super determined, so I don't think anyone was surprised with how successful my blog was, she says. It was always expected of me   that I'd do something pretty out of the norm.","Here's how she paid off her debt and grew her income so quickly.","How did you pay off your student loans so quickly?","Six months before I graduated, I received a letter stating how much I would owe every month when I graduated. It was going to be $500 a month or so. I don't remember the number, but it was a number I felt was way too high for my income. I decided I didn't want it hanging over my head for the rest of my life, so I figured I would try to pay it off as quickly as I could so I didn't have to worry about it 10 years from now. I figured a little bit of pain now would be worthwhile later.","So in addition to being a financial analyst, I also did a bunch of side jobs. Altogether, I was working 100 hours a week. My side jobs consisted of taking surveys, mystery shopping, doing staff writing, doing research phone calls for companies and other things.","As soon as I earned any extra money, I put it toward my student loan debt so it wouldn't be sitting in my bank account and I wouldn't be thinking of other ways to spend it.","What were your expenses during this time?","My boyfriend at the time (now my husband) and I had bought a house when we were 20, and our mortgage was less than $1,000, but I had other regular expenses like transportation, groceries, etc. We also had combined our finances, so it helped that we shared our bills.","When did the blog start coming into the picture?","I had actually started my blog in August 2011, before I graduated with my finance MBA. I got the idea one day when I was reading Cosmo and they had an article featuring the personal finance site Daily Worth. I started reading that website and I became super-interested in personal finance blogs.","I started my blog as a hobby. I didn't start it thinking I'd make an income from it. Six months later, I made my first $100 from my blog when a blogger friend who was already profiting from her blog connected me with an advertiser. I didn't even know blogs could make money.","Until then, my blog had genuinely just been fun for me. But once I realized I could make money, it boosted my motivation. I sought out deals and wanted to see if companies wanted to sponsor my blog. Also, companies would approach me. When my blog had been just a hobby, they would approach me, but I would ignore all those emails. Once I realized I could make money from my blog, I took them more seriously and gave them my rates. At that time, I charged $100 for a sponsored post on my blog or $150 for an advertisement on my sidebar.  I also made a little bit on Google Adsense and affiliate income, where I was promoting other companies' products, and if one of my readers bought through me, the company would pay me.","My advertisers were mainly financial companies like coupon websites and cell phone apps and other services that helped people save money. At that time, it wasn't so much banks, but I do have bank advertisers now and I charge them much more than that of course.","I also started looking for opportunities writing for other bloggers and immersing myself into the blogging community.","How much did you earn from the blog to begin with?","In the beginning, in May of 2012, I earned $500. And by December 2012, I was up to $5,700 that month. The month I paid off my student loans, July of 2013, I earned $11,000 that month.","How exactly does the blog bring in money?","Now, I'm making money in much different ways from just a few years ago. Before I was making money from sponsored posts and by writing for other blogs, and now the majority is through affiliate marketing   $50,000 a month is from that, and that's the bulk of my income. There are 15-20 companies I actively promote on my social media and blog platform.","The other big revenue stream is my affiliate marketing course, in which I teach other bloggers how to create affiliate income. In November 2016, that accounted for $38,000 of my income. I created that because I had so many bloggers email me asking them to teach them how to increase their affiliate marketing earnings. Now it's more a form of passive income, since I already created the source and people just purchase it and all the instructions and lessons are already done.","My third biggest source of income from my blog is advertising. In those instances, maybe I partner with a bank and they ask me to advertise a certain service or product that they are currently selling. Or I participate in a Twitter chat with the company, or they do some kind of advertisement on my social media platforms.","Why did your income roughly triple from 2015 to 2016?","In 2015, I decided to stop doing all my freelancing. I stopped doing virtual assisting and decided to focus entirely on my blogging business. I was nervous to get rid of all my clients, but I realized I truly loved blogging myself and not blogging for others.","By focusing on my business, I was finally able to find ways to diversify my income, improve my blog, increase my traffic, and come up with extra ideas for my blog, such as the course, which now accounts for a big chunk of my income   20%-30%.","I also was able to focus on affiliate marketing and improving my traffic, which directly relates to making more money blogging as well. It only took me a few months after I dropped all those clients to start seeing the jump in my income.","I was making $12,000-$15,000 monthly when I decided I was going to focus just on my own business, then I made a jump to the $20,000-$30,000 range, and it just kept going to $40,000, then $50,000, to where I am now at $100,000.","How has your changing income changed your lifestyle?","As a full-time blogger I have a flexible schedule and am my own boss and now travel full-time. My husband, who used to be a new car salesman, quit his day job at the same time I quit mine in October 2013 when I was making $10,000 a month from the blog   and now works on the blog too. At the time, we were making more from our day jobs put together than from the blog, but we knew we could live off our blog if we did it full-time.","The main lifestyle change is that we live in an RV, are location-independent and work wherever we can. We sold our house in Missouri in July 2015 and now we work from wherever.","Why did you start living in an RV?","My husband has always wanted to live in an RV, and he spent a long time convincing me to live in an RV. There's always a joke in the RV community that there's always one person who wants to do it and then the other person has to spend years convincing the other person to do it.  That's pretty much how it was.","But I stepped into an RV one day   we just decided to look at one   and I loved being in it. So we decided to give RVing a shot. It was just going to be a weekend thing to see family or do short weekend or week trips, but we came to love it and never went home. We would be gone for a month or two at a time, so we just decided to turn the RV thing into a full-time venture and haven't looked back since.","How big was your house? ","We had a finished basement, and so if you count that, 2,500 square feet. If you don't, it was 1,200 square feet with three bedrooms.","How big is the RV?","It's 400 square feet if you include all the slides being out.","Did you have to get rid of a lot of stuff?","Yes, the Salvation Army came and took a bunch of stuff, and we rented a dumpster to collect broken appliances and junk and we had neighbors come and just take whatever they wanted for free. We kept clothing and photo albums.","How does living in an RV make your finances different from other people's?","It doesn't really change. Our RV cost more than our house, but RVing can be as cheap or expensive as you want it to be   just like with a normal home. There are cheap RVs, and there are RVs worth millions of dollars. It's comparable to living in a home, but I have a different view all the time. There are free places to stay, but we mainly choose private campgrounds or state parks that cost money.","We usually stay in one place for a month. We like to follow the weather, so we like to stay in a forever 70-degree weather area, and we like to follow activities we like such as riding our bikes outside and going for a hike, so 70-degree weather is what we're looking for all year long.","How has all this newfound wealth changed you?","I'm not as stressed about money as I was just a few years ago. But I'm just as frugal as before. It's not below me to use a coupon. I just don't like to be wasteful. If there's a way to save money, I'm not going to waste time to find ways to save money, but if a money saver is there, I'll go for it.","How has your wealth changed your relationships?","It really hasn't changed them too much. We're often told that people are surprised we're the same and that you would expect people making $100,000 a month to not be as nice or down to earth. But many of our friends still call us down-to-earth.","How was money handled when you were growing up and what habits or attitudes did you carry into adulthood? ","My mom wasn't super good with money, but my dad was better, so I learned what to do from him. He taught me how to live within my budget and also how to use a credit card correctly. A lot of people think credit cards are the root of all evil, but you can use them to build your credit score and you can earn rewards points with them.","I'm still very frugal. I don't pay for any form of TV, I don't have cable, Netflix, Hulu or anything like that. We haven't spent any money on TV since February 2015 to save money and also to not spend as much time watching TV. I feel like there's plenty of things to watch on local channels. If I had any more channels, I'd be in front of the TV all day long.","How much time do you spend on your blog?","Between 40 and 60 hours a week. I work longer hours when I'm trying to get far ahead in my blog content. I currently do three blog posts a week.","Do you have help?","I do have an editor who edits my site and a tech person to make sure my site is always up and live and no one is hacking it.","What do you do with your extra income? ","We invest a lot in Vanguard funds and are saving for retirement one day. By next year, we should have plenty of money to retire early if we chose too. But I still love blogging, so I don't see that ending anytime soon.","For the next few years, we plan on RVing here and in Canada, and then afterward sailing full-time and go to other countries. I'd have to find ways to manage my internet access. But we do know many bloggers who blog full-time and sail, so it's not impossible."],"targetTitle":"How This 27-Year-Old Made $1 Million Last Year","targetDescription":"Four years ago, Michelle Schroeder-Gardner was almost $40,000 in debt.

There are many tools in our toolbox to make this all possible, and today we're going to talk about one more: the FIFO method of sorting your groceries.","FIFO stands for first in, first out. It's a method used in accounting, and, wait for it, at the grocery store. When the supermarket gets fresh milk in stock, for example, they place the older stuff in front and the newer stuff behind it. This ensures that the consumer will purchase the older product first, before it spoils and they have to throw it out. It's a simple concept, but an effective one. Here's what you need to do with that information: use this method at home.","Putting away the groceries can sometimes feel like the worst part of this essential kitchen chore, so it's understandable if you just shove the groceries into the fridge without a second thought. We get it, but stop. Instead, move all the perishable older goods to the front and place the newer groceries behind them. This small step will ensure that you use up last week's groceries before digging in to the newer stuff.","Start today and see the difference.

But the beloved British children\u2019s book author was also known for the distinctive language he used to create the vivid, often dark, worlds in which the characters lived.","To honor the centenary of his birth this month, the Oxford English Dictionary has updated its latest edition today (Sept. 12) with six new words connected to Dahl\u2019s writing, and revisions to six other phrases popularized by Dahl\u2019s evocative stories. In May, the Oxford University Press also published a Roald Dahl Dictionary complete with 8,000 words coined or popularized by the author.","There was linguistic method to Dahl\u2019s mad use of language. \"He was using very linguistic principles,\" says Vineeta Gupta, head of children\u2019s dictionaries at Oxford University Press. Dahl invented words based on old words, rhymes, malapropisms, and spoonerisms (swapping the first letters of words around, such as \"catasterous disastrophe\" from The BFG). Dahl also played with sound (\"sizzle-pan\" to refer to a frying pan in The BFG, for example).","Here are the new Dahlisms added to the OED, and the revised phrases, with notes on their origins.","New entries","Dahlesque The characteristics of Dahl\u2019s work\u2014in the OED\u2019s words, \"eccentric plots, villainous or loathsome adult characters, and gruesome or black humour\"\u2014now have their own adjective. The term was first used in 1983 by the literary magazine Books Ireland.","Golden ticket These refer to the tickets hidden in chocolate bars that granted access to Willy Wonka\u2019s chocolate factory in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964). The first golden ticket, however, was awarded to 18th century painter William Hogarth, giving him admission to the Vauxhall Gardens in London, in recognition of his paintings of the venue.","Human bean This is a mispronunciation of \"human being,\" uttered by the giant in The BFG (1982): \"We is having an interesting babblement about the taste of the human bean. The human bean is not a vegetable.\" The first instance of the phrase is over a century older, having been used in an issue of the British satirical magazine Punch in 1842.","Oompa Loompa The diminutive factory workers who played music and danced in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory were made more famous by the 1971 film adaption of the book, starring Gene Wilder. Gupta called the phrase \"typical Dahlesque,\" reflecting how the author played with sound to convey meaning.","Scrumdiddlyumptious \"Extremely scrumptious","excellent, splendid","(esp. of food) delicious.\" Although the word was first found in The American Thesaurus of Slang in 1942, Dahl\u2019s giant\u2019s use of it planted it firmly in the minds of every child who read The BFG: \"Every human bean is diddly and different.

{"postId":"426590828782694400","postText":["The most unexpected country that rocks at making olive oil"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country. Concrete boxes are replaced with olive groves, and the words \"traffic jam\" tend to mean that a group of goats have convened, gathering and blocking the road. Needless to say, I greatly enjoy the small villages of the Peloponnese. So when George Papageorgiou, the owner of Esti Olive Oil, asked me if I wanted to go to Kalamata to see how they harvest the olives and turn them into olive oil, I jumped at the chance. To me this was kind of like winning the lottery. I was going to the Peloponnese and getting a chance to enjoy some \"liquid gold.\"","Being Greek, I grew up eating olive oil. I know others might disagree with me, but I will take a good quality olive oil over butter any day! I love using it to make popcorn. I drizzle it on fresh tomatoes and slices of bread. I use it to fry fish and as an ingredient in cakes. Before there were rules for the amount of liquid you could carrying on a plane, my mother and I would bring half-gallon containers of olive oil back from our trips to Greece.","The best olive oils come from Greece. I say this with objectivity as a chef, and would like to think that this overrides any bias that my Greek heritage holds. In Greece it is said that the best of Greek olive oils come from the Peloponnese. For years I have wished that Greeks would be more like the Italians. The Italians do a fantastic job of exporting and promoting their products to other countries. With the booming introduction of Greek yogurt into the U.S., I'm hoping that Greek olive oil will soon follow suit. George Papageorgiou is trying to make that happen.","The Esti olive grove in Kalamata is located in a beautiful sunlit valley. The grove of mature olive trees look as if they belong in Greek mythology. The olives must be harvested at a specific time during the ripening process. Like Goldilocks searching amongst the belongings of the three bears, George is in constant search for the olives that are \"just right.\" If the olives are too green the olive oil produced will taste bitter. If the olives are too black, the quality of the olive oil will be lost. It's a constant balancing act.","As we headed into the olive grove, numerous fine mesh nets were being laid down to gather and catch all the olives. Workers set up ladders to reach the tall branches. The lower hanging branches were gently being shaken, taking care not to wound the trees. I began to collect olives in my little basket. As my hands turned a reddish-brown, I reminisced about the days I used to spend as a child, collecting olives with my yiayia.","We took the gathered olives back to the production plant where George had them ground into paste using large millstones. \"This,\" he explained \"is the traditional method used for making olive oil.\" After grinding, the paste then gets slowly stirred in a separate container for 20 to 40 minutes. This is a process known as malaxation. With malaxation the slow churning action allows the small droplets of oil that were released in the milling process to aggregate, forming large droplets of oil which facilitates mechanical extraction. I was a bit overwhelmed during the whole process. I looked around the manufacturing facility, much like a child the first time they visit Disneyland. I snapped pictures. I wanted to see what was behind every door. I asked George if the oil we had witnessed being made was virgin or extra virgin. I had always assumed that the grading of \"extra virgin\" denoted a different process or different stage in the olive's ripeness. George shook his head. This was not correct. In fact, all olive oil produced by physical (mechanical) means is virgin. The differentiation of \"extra virgin\" is the virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical and organoleptic criteria. In layman's terms it is the virgin olive oil that has low free acidity and no quality defects.","The final room we visited that day was lined with shiny steel tanks, much like a winery. The storage of the olive oil in steel tanks helps to preserve it and keep it from oxidizing. It's the final resting place for the olive oil before it is bottled.","In Greek, the word theoxenia comes from mythology and relates to hospitality; how hosts treat guests or even strangers. It's an important part of Greek culture. This was something George clearly keeps in mind. Before leaving the facility that day, George sent me home with a box filled with bottles of olive oil: virgin, extra virgin, organic extra virgin. That night, and many nights since, I have enjoyed his olive oils. In each bite I can taste the olive grove and its bright sun-kissed fruit. I can't help but think that everyone, even the French, might fall in love with olive oil if they had a chance to taste the Greek rendition."],"targetTitle":"Making Olive Oil in the Peloponnese","targetDescription":"Even though the Peloponnese is only an hour's drive away from Athens, it's as if you're entering another world, or at least another country.

{"postId":"839832823301357569","postText":["Why 2017 is the year to visit Kathmandu"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["With the two year anniversary of the Nepal earthquake approaching, the capital is back on its feet. Now's the time to go, says Martin Symington","Why go now?","There\u2019s a compelling reason for visiting in 2017. Every rupee spent in hotels and restaurants, shops, taxis or temples, is helping Kathmandu back on to its feet. Nearly two years after the earthquake which devastated swathes of Nepal and severely damaged the capital, Kathmandu is bouncing back to its alluring self with astonishing verve. Rebuilding and restoration is proceeding apace while tourists are returning to bathe in the Himalayan city\u2019s sensory overload: temples and squares; prayer flags and sputtering scooters; merchants yelling behind marigold-garlanded stalls amid wafts of incense, spices and holy cow dung.","Get your bearings","The old city, known as Durbar Square, lies at the centre of Kathmandu. To its north, frenetic Thamel is a maze of hotels, restaurants, trekking agencies and shops. To the south, the Bagmati River borders peaceful Patan district with its own Durbar Square and expatriate communities. Beyond the former Royal Palace to the east are the smarter shopping centres and embassies.","Local tempos (minibuses) and buses are best avoided \u2013 they're crowded, slow and not the safest. However, taxis are cheap and plentiful and rickshaws can be a useful way of travelling short distances.","Take a view","Puff your way up the 400-step stone staircase to the Buddhist stupa of Swayambhunath (1), known as \u2018Monkey Temple\u2019 on account of the hundreds of \u2018holy\u2019 monkeys who will be your chattering, food-begging companions. If the day is clear, the whole of Kathmandu valley unfurls at your feet. You will see from here how localised the earthquake damage was; isolated pockets have collapsed like cards while large areas remained more or less unscathed. ","Take a hike","Nowhere is the localised nature of the earthquake damage more apparent that in the area known as Durbar Square, a riot of ancient palaces, temples and royal monuments which comprise the UNESCO-listed historic heart of Kathmandu.","Start at the northern, Thamel end check post (2) where tourists pay an entrance fee of 1000Rs (about \u00a37.70) fee for free run of the whole area. Join throngs of pilgrims at Shiva-dedicated Mahendreshwar Mandir (3) with its chiming bells and flickering candles. Follow the flow down to Jagannath Mandir (4), a Hindu temple which attracts gawping fascination on account of its athletic and imaginative erotic carvings which seems to suggest that the earth has always moved in these parts.","If it\u2019s between 10am and noon, keep an eye out \u2013 the Kumari Devi, or living \u2018child-goddess\u2019 might put in an appearance at her window above the courtyard of her magnificently carved sacred home, the Kumari Dar (5). However, now that you are down at the south end of the historic region, the heartrending extend of the earthquake damage becomes unavoidable. Cordoned off for safety is the red brick old Royal Palace, (6) whose walls are now cracked, while the adjacent Basantapur Tower (7) somehow remain precariously erect. Exit via \u2018Freak Street\u2019 (official name Jochne) (8), the legendary 1960s hippy hangout (though its glory days are now over).","Lunch on the run","Climb six flights of stairs to the rooftop Kasthamandap Cafe\u0301 (9) at 23 Maru (00 977 1 6219177, no web) for an open-air coffee and snack under a sun umbrella. There are commanding views over Durbar Square.","Window shopping","The Thamel district, north of Durbar Square, survived the earthquake more or less intact and remains the backpacker hub (a successor to Freak Street). It\u2019s a carnival of noisy alleys and tiny squares, packed with hundreds of trekking agencies and shops hawking everything from tourist tat to genuine Tibetan antiques. One good bet for quality thanka paintings and woven rugs, is Amrita Craft (10) on Chhetrapait.","An aperitif","Owner Prakash will probably be around to welcome you in person to Zibro (11) on Chaksibari Marg (00 977 984 1059449, no web), his laid-back rooftop bar where young Nepalis shoot the breeze with holidaying Indians and European travellers. The music is on multi-cultural message too, with songs from little known local bands playing Nepali folk-rock fusion in the background. It\u2019s a great place to make new friends over a glass of local craft beer Khumbu Kolsch.","Dine with the locals","At Bhojan Griha (12), on Dilli Bazaar in the eastern district of Kathmandu, traditional \u2018Newari\u2019 dishes are served to guests in a 19th-century mansion, restored with painstaking attention to detail. Dishes include buffalo meat or vegetable-filled momo dumplings, and duck with peanuts and spiced lentils. The restaurant says that all produce is organic and no plastic is used. Mains around \u00a36-8.","Take a ride","For the ride of your life, board a small propeller plane for a dawn \u2018Mountain Flight\u2019 along the crest of the Himalayas. You\u2019ll pass up close and personal many of the world\u2019s highest peaks, including Mount Everest. Flights are in the early mornings when conditions are generally clearest, but good views are weather-dependent and weather-related cancellations are frequent.  An hour-long flight with Buddha Air costs US$192 (\u00a3158).","Sunday morning: out to brunch","La Dolce Vita (13), at Chaksibhari Marg (00 977 1 4700612, no web), doesn\u2019t have the best coffee in Kathmandu, but what it lacks in a caffeine fix it makes up for with delicious Italian pastries, pasta and gnocchi, sprinkled with grated yak\u2019s cheese. Sit on the sunny terrace watching the street dramas of chaotic Thamel below. Open from 11am, meals around \u00a38-10.","A walk in the park","It says a lot that Swapna Bagaicha (14) on Kaiser Mahal, Tridevi Marg, is also known as the Garden of Dreams. A botanical park and serene retreat from the frenetic city, it\u2019s just a few minutes\u2019 walk from central Thamel. Sadly, the park took a hard hit in the earthquake, damaging some of the neo-classical pavilions, statues, ponds and fountains. Nevertheless, the plants are still lovingly tended and the Rs 200 (\u00a31.50) entrance fee is being put to good restorative use.","Cultural afternoon","The historic Buddhist city of Patan \u2013 effectively a suburb of Kathmandu \u2013 is a 20-minute taxi ride across the tea-coloured Bagmati River. Patan is a repository of temples, palaces and stupas strewn around its own Durbar Square. Sadly, several of these took hits in the earthquake. The fac\u0327ade of the Kwa Bahal (15), also known as the Golden Temple, is one almost untouched highlight; the four giant, prayer flag-festooned Ashoka Stupas (16) are another. And then there\u2019s the fact it\u2019s guarded by scores of \u2018holy tortoises\u2019.","The icing on the cake","Treat yourself to a massage by a Seeing Hands blind masseur whose fingers are attuned to muscle and tissue in ways that the sighted will never match. At the same time, support this commendable organisation which provides employment and independence for Nepal\u2019s blind men and women. A range of therapies are offered in a clinical setting, in its premises off Jyatha Road, Thamel (17).","Getting there","Qatar Airways flies to Kathmandu via Doha from Heathrow, Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh, from \u00a3685 return. Other options include Etihad via Abu Dhabi and Jet Airways via Delhi or Mumbai.   ","Staying there","Hotel Shangri-La (18) is, as the name suggests, as swanky as Kathmandu gets. It\u2019s an inviting, low-rise modern hotel with traditional flourishes in a lush garden with cool pool. Doubles from \u00a3105, B&B.","Something of a Thamel institution \u2013 everyone from Jeremy Irons to Ricky Martin have stayed here \u2013 the Kathmandu Guest House (19) is a bit rough round the edges these days, but still a good mid-range choice \u2013 it\u2019s located in a former palace.

Both our iPhone and Android apps have had multiple releases, and we\u2019re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this live thread, and notable changes to the site are listed in r\/changelog.","We\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on \/new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.","As it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we tested adding affiliate tags to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off","we announced Promoted User Posts","and we announced tests we\u2019ll be running on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r\/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.","Yesterday, we previewed new moderator mail to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.","We\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.","Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else."],"targetTitle":"Click to hear about some of the things that have been keeping us busy...","targetDescription":"I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

There\u2019s only one way to stop it happening"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["I hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces hate to be an alarmist, but Donald Trump could be on course to be elected president of the United States \u2013 and the decisive moment may well come on Monday night. That\u2019s when he faces Hillary Clinton in what is expected to be one of the most watched events in television history. The TV debates are perhaps the last chance for her to persuade the American people that this man is unqualified for, and unworthy of, the presidency and poses a genuine threat to the republic.","If that sounds like panic, then I\u2019m not the only one. Sweaty-palmed nausea has become a leading symptom among those who tremble at the prospect of a Trump presidency. A new Slate podcast is called Time to Panic . Number cruncher Nate Silver, who gives Trump a 40% probability of winning, triggered another round of liberal angst this week when he tweeted that he had \"Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial about something as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as primaries, Brexit.\"","Never seen otherwise smart people in so much denial as they are about Trump\u2019s chances. Same mistake as Brexit Nate Silver","The source of the alarm is not so much the national polls, where Clinton is a few points ahead, but surveys from those battleground states where the presidency will be decided. In the last week, polls have put Trump in front in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and, most neuralgic of all, Florida.","So low are expectations for his performance on Monday \u2013 where it is assumed that his opponent, a seasoned debater, will wipe the floor with him \u2013 that if Trump manages to speak in vaguely coherent sentences and not deliver a misogynist insult to Clinton\u2019s face, his advocates will declare that he looked \"presidential\" and anoint him the winner. If he can somehow persuade wavering voters that he is not so ridiculous as to merit automatic disqualification, he will have cleared a crucial hurdle.","And for all her experience, Clinton heads towards this first, and therefore most important, debate facing some serious obstacles. She\u2019s been advised that she mustn\u2019t interrupt too much or talk over Trump: apparently voters react badly to seeing a woman act that way. According to a New York Times report well sourced from inside Hillary\u2019s debate preparation team, \"she does not want to be seen as pushy and play into gender stereotypes\". This was not something Barack Obama, or husband Bill, ever had to worry about.","Activists in Berlin dismantle what they called a Wall of Hate showing Donald Trump in front of the Brandenburg Gate on 23 September.","But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies? One reporter following Trump has taken to logging the falsehoods he tells each day: no small task.","Take two areas where you\u2019d assume that to be caught in untruth would be terminal for a presidential candidate. Trump has been exposed for serial lying over 9\/11 , falsely claiming to have lost hundreds of friends that day; to have seen thousands of Muslims cheering the fall of the twin towers; and to have helped in the rescue effort. He even milked cash from a 9\/11 relief fund.","This week he was found to have raided $258,000 from the charitable foundation that bears his name to settle assorted legal problems. Earlier he dipped into that same charity box, filled by others\u2019 donations, to pay for a larger than life $10,000 painting \u2013 of himself. He lies about 9\/11. He lies about charity. But on he strides.","But Trump himself presents her with an unprecedented conundrum. How does she take on a candidate who lies and lies and lies?\u2019","So where can Hillary begin? If she calls him a liar, he\u2019ll hit back over her use of a private email server, calling her Crooked Hillary, knowing that some 60% of Americans believe she\u2019s dishonest. The risk is that he\u2019ll use her experience and expertise against her, casting her as the boring know-it-all against the freewheeling, entertaining guy who relies on good old gut instinct.","If that sounds familiar, that\u2019s because it\u2019s a show we\u2019ve already seen. In 2000 Al Gore was clearly the more accomplished, ready-for-office candidate. But he came across as impatient and pompous against the looser, backslapping George W Bush. Never mind that one was a visionary on the issue of climate change while the other would lead the US into the catastrophic invasion of Iraq. On the night, Bush came across better on TV.","Which brings us to a core problem facing Hillary Clinton. Polls show there are millions of voters, especially young ones, who agree in big numbers that Trump is a racist and a sexist, unqualified for America\u2019s highest office \u2013 but who are refusing to back Clinton. One survey of 18- to 34-year-olds recorded dire numbers for Trump, but still found only 31% supporting Clinton, with 29% preferring libertarian Gary Johnson and 15% the Green candidate Jill Stein. If those numbers are replicated on election day, Trump will win.","This too stirs queasy memories of 2000. In that year, a small but significant bloc on the left voted for Ralph Nader instead of Gore. More than 90,000 voted for Nader in Florida, a state Gore was eventually deemed to have lost by just 537 votes. Had even a tiny fraction of those Naderites decided to hold their nose and choose Gore instead, there would have been no Bush presidency \u2013 and no Iraq war.","I know this is a sore, and contested, point among those who chose Nader, who to this day blame Gore for not doing enough to appeal to the left (forgetting perhaps that he also had to appeal to centrist voters in order to win the election). But the basic case is surely clear. In a two-party system like America\u2019s, if you want to stop Trump, then a vote for Johnson or Stein will not do it. Only a vote for Clinton can prevent a white nationalist bigot becoming the next US president.","You might think this is all so obvious that it barely needs stating. But 2000 can seem like ancient history to those who don\u2019t remember it. And here, younger voters are not to blame. Older liberals haven\u2019t seared the Bush calamity into the minds of the next generation. They never turned 2000 into a cautionary tale of the cost of third-party indulgence. As the New Republic put it this week, \"Liberals have failed to teach millennials about the horror of George W Bush.\" (Republicans, meanwhile, bang on about the supposedly dismal presidency of Jimmy Carter to this day, just as British Conservatives invoked the 1979 \"winter of discontent\" for over three decades. It is the centre-left that is oddly reticent about exploiting its opponents\u2019 history of failure.)","So now, even though the hour is late, this is the case Democrats must make. That this is an exceptional election because Donald Trump represents an exceptional menace, to America and to the world. It is indeed a referendum on Trump and the only way to vote no in that referendum is to vote Clinton. She may not be the candidate of your dreams, but she\u2019s all that stands between you and an American nightmare.","You don\u2019t have to love her. You don\u2019t even have to like her. You\u2019re not saying she\u2019s flawless (though the current Democratic platform is its most progressive in 30 years, thanks in part to the challenge of Bernie Sanders). As Joe Biden puts it, \"Don\u2019t compare her to the Almighty. Compare her to the alternative.\" And the alternative is President Trump."],"targetTitle":"President Trump?

{"postId":"4xpiml","postText":["The Secret Reason Apple Might Be Killing the iPhone headphone jack"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Apple is expected to unveil its next iPhone in a few weeks. And, as is usual pattern, more and more credible leaks have come out about what will presumably be called the iPhone 7","Bloomberg probably has the most accurate reporting thus far (thanks to its hiring of Apple reporter Mark Gurman) in a report that basically confirms what has leaked out about the iPhone over the next few months. The big news is that the form factor will remain largely the same, there will be a dual-lens camera system for the larger iPhone, and the home button will provide haptic feedback rather than depress like a physical button. Oh yeah, and the headphone jack ? It's dead. Dunzo","Let's all take a moment of silence for the headphone jack.","Not to downplay the new stuff (though I have thoughts on that, just wait), it's worth noting that this follows my playbook for bulletproof iPhone predictions to a tee.","In case you need a reminder, this is what we can always expect from a new iPhone:","It will be Apple's fastest iPhone ever.","It will have Apple's most advanced optics.","There will be at least one extra feature you can't get on any other iPhone.","It will come in rose gold.","And now, I guess we can add, \"it won't have a headphone jack.\"","Still, I'm sure I'm not the only person who looks at the leaks of the next iPhone and says, \"Huh. OK.\"","\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 If we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.","This isn't to say I won't still buy the next iPhone \u2014 I'm TOTALLY going to buy the new iPhone in September \u2014 but if we're being honest, this probably won't be the most exciting iPhone release we've seen.","Personally, I think that's OK. I'm not completely sure how I feel about Apple potentially shifting the design upgrade from every two years to every three \u2014 new colors aside, that makes it really hard to show off that you've got the latest and greatest phone \u2014 but now that we're nearly a decade into the modern smartphone era, it might not be realistic to expect new designs every other year.","Regardless of what other whiz-bang goodness Apple introduces this year \u2014 and I'm sure there will be at least one feature that will make even the most jaded amongst us salivate \u2014 the reality is that this will absolutely be the iPhone remembered as \"the one where Apple dropped the headphone jack.\"","That's it. Pack it up.","Waterproof casing, wireless charging, better battery life and more powerful optics could all be things we see. And these would be amazing upgrades \u2014 old design or not \u2014 but the real headline is that this is the first iPhone without a headphone jack.","I can say with absolute certainty that every major review of the device is going to focus substantially on this fact.","And thinking about it, I have to wonder: Is Apple making such an enormous and potentially unpopular change this year so that next year's iPhone \u2014 you know, the one that might have an all-glass display and an ultra-sharp AMOLED screen \u2014 won't suffer? That's the phone that might ditch the home button altogether. It's also the phone that will coincidentally be released the same year as the 10th anniversary of the original iPhone.","And Apple loves to celebrate anniversaries.","\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 A 20th Anniversary Edition Macintosh from 1997. Fun fact: This was one of the first product designs from Jony Ive. Image: Christie's auction house","Downplaying the iPhone 7 so the NEXT iPhone can thrive","Maybe I'm reading too much into the tea leaves, but it strikes me that Apple could be deliberately cutting the headphone jack this year \u2014 a year that is already going to be less exciting by virtue of no major redesign \u2014 in order to protect the next iPhone from the inevitable backlash over the headphone jack's removal.","\ue600 \ue601 \ue602 \ue605 The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port.","Yes, yes, I've been telling everyone to accept that the headphone jack is dead since January . A frequent point of discussion on our podcast, MashTalk , has been about the headphone jack and where all of us are in facing reality. Even Tech Editor Pete Pachal has come around to see the light. The jack is dead.","And there will be backlash. The backlash will be angrier than when Apple changed from the 30-pin connector to the Lightning port (making all of those old dock accessories obsolete) and the rallying cry from pundits is already louder than it was when Apple decided to not include a floppy drive on the original iMac.","I feel very certain that, backlash aside, the ultimate fallout of a headphone jack-free iPhone will be minimal. People will grumble. Adapters will be annoying and we'll all bitch and moan about how Bluetooth just isn't good enough. But we'll survive and within a year, most of us will be used to using either Lightning headphones, dongles or snazzy wireless options. We'll have moved on.","Which of course, means that the buzz around the 2017 iPhone will be all positive. New design, new screen and some other snazzy feature. But that missing headphone jack? So last year's problem.","And that's why, the more I think about it, the more I feel like the iPhone 7 has to be a little bit boring so that we can get really hyped about the next big iPhone, and it needs to drop the headphone jack now, so the 10th anniversary iPhone doesn't carry that particular scarlet letter.","Despite the inevitable death of the headphone jack, I'm still going to buy the iPhone 7. But I mostly just want to get this release over with so I can start looking forward to the iPhone 8. So, I suspect, does Apple."],"targetTitle":"The secret reason Apple might be killing the iPhone 7 headphone jack","targetDescription":"GIPHY is your top source for the best & newest GIFs & Animated Stickers online.

{"postId":"4p1r2p","postText":["Here\u2019s what happens when schools let transgender students use the bathroom they want"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["At least once a day, Pam Retzlaff answered a call from parents concerned about her decision to allow a transgender student at Edgar Road Elementary School to use a bathroom different from his biological gender.","\"It was hard in the beginning, very hard,\" she said. \"You can imagine my first open house. I had more parents in my office than ever before.\"","It was new territory for Retzlaff, then principal of the school in Webster Groves, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb, but it was never a question of whether she would or wouldn\u2019t open the bathroom.","And as time passed, the calls slowly began to subside, going from once a day, to once a week, to once a month. ","That was more than two years ago \u2013 a blip in the schoolwide effort to help the soon-to-be third-grader transition as seamlessly as possible from female to male \u2013 yet still no cohesive policy exists nationwide on the issue of bathroom access for transgender students. ","Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting transgender rights, or this month\u2019s deadly mass shooting at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.","Opponents of policies that accommodate the bathroom needs of transgender students have argued that it\u2019s an issue of safety for non-transgender students.","In reality, however, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students face the greater risk of harassment and assault, especially transgender students, and supporters say the bathroom discussion should be focused on protecting their safety. ","According to FBI statistics, more than 20 percent of reported hate crimes were attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 second only to race, and more than attacks based on religious bias.","Although some state attorneys general and legislators have taken the federal government to court over its directive instructing all public school districts to allow transgender students to use restrooms that match their gender identity, school districts in those very states have quietly dealt with the issue with relative ease. ","And students, rather than state officials or school administrators, are often at the forefront in pushing for the change.","Eliza Byard, executive director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, a New York-based organization that supports LGBT-inclusive policies for teachers and students, said school leaders and students live with the issue and understand it better than elected officials do.","\"If they were listening to local authorities,\" she said, \"they\u2019d get out of the way.\"","Atherton High School in Louisville, Kentucky, has had a policy in place for two years that allows transgender students to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity, and Principal Thomas Aberli says there have been no problems. ","\"The most recent federal guidelines are aligned with what we\u2019ve been doing for the past two years,\" Aberli said in an interview.","Despite some concerns that permitting transgender students to use the appropriate bathroom might threaten the safety and privacy of other students, Aberli said that hasn\u2019t happened at Atherton.","\"We have several transgender students now,\" he said. \"It\u2019s just kind of a non-issue.\"","In March, Springfield Central High School in Massachusetts converted two single-user faculty bathrooms into two gender-neutral bathrooms, one each for faculty and students. Principal Thaddeus Tokarz said transgender students aren\u2019t required to use it, though some choose to do so.","\"I believe we make it a point to have them use the bathroom they feel most comfortable with,\" Tokarz said.","In Camas, Wash., across the Columbia River from Portland, Ore., Liberty Middle School Principal Marilyn Boerke said she was prepared for an onslaught of complaints from parents in the conservative district when the school adopted its policy in 2014, \"but it just didn\u2019t happen.\" ","The 770-student school allows its five or so transgender students to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Only two parents objected, Boerke said.","In response, Boerke told those parents that if their children were uncomfortable sharing a restroom with a trans student, they could opt to use another. ","\"Part of that could be how our community at Liberty is really all about family,\" she said. \"We just don\u2019t accept that kind of intolerance.\"","But the backlash is only beginning elsewhere.","In Texas, Lt. Gov Dan Patrick has demanded the resignation of Kent Scribner, Fort Worth\u2019s school superintendent, over the district\u2019s transgender-inclusive bathroom policy. Patrick also argued for its repeal, calling it \"social engineering.\"","Texas is leading a multistate lawsuit in federal court against the Obama administration\u2019s policy. ","Last month, the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Justice Department told schools across the country that Title IX of a 1972 federal education law protects transgender students from discrimination based on sex, including the use of bathrooms, locker rooms and showering facilities.","The department reminded schools that those that did not comply with Title IX requirements risked losing federal funds. ","In a Virginia case, a federal court agreed with the federal government and sided with a transgender student who challenged his school\u2019s policy that forces him to a bathroom that does not match his gender identity. ","Nevertheless, Texas and 10 other states sued the Obama administration last month, with Mississippi, Kentucky and Kansas later joining the effort.","This month, the Kansas Board of Education voted unanimously to oppose the Obama administration\u2019s policy, though the board will allow school districts to continue policies that accommodate transgender students.","According to the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network\u2019s 2013 School Climate Survey, transgender and gender-nonconforming students faced more hostility than lesbian, gay or bisexual students did.","Four in 10 said they felt unsafe at school because of their gender expression. About half reported being verbally harassed, and about 1 in 5 reported being physically assaulted.","The majority of students surveyed said they didn\u2019t report the harassment or assault to school officials because of doubt the staff would do anything about it or fear that it could make things worse.","Some schools that have accommodated transgender students say the move has improved the learning environment.","\"This was probably the best decision we made as a school all year,\" said Kevin Biggs, principal of Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.","Although he said students were always able to use the most appropriate bathroom for their needs, Biggs said a student visited him in November and explained that some transgender students didn\u2019t feel comfortable using the bathrooms that were available. ","The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February. Students can still choose what works best for them.","\"Those little things make a huge difference in a student\u2019s day","they\u2019re distractions that can keep students from learning to their highest possible potential,\" Biggs said. \"We wanted to make that possible.\" ","Student Alonzo Hernandez, 16, helped kick-start the process of creating a multi-stalled gender-neutral bathroom at the Santee Education Complex, a high school in Los Angeles, where he is a junior. ","Hernandez is in transition from female to male, and his effort was driven, in part, by his own discomfort in using the school\u2019s existing bathrooms. He\u2019d sometimes avoid going to the bathroom the whole day to avoid harassment.","\"There\u2019d be times when I would personally wait in the stall to make sure everyone in the bathroom was cleared out so I could come out of the stall,\" he said in an interview.","The concerns weren\u2019t unfounded. Jose Lara, dean of students and faculty adviser for the Los Angeles school\u2019s gay-straight alliance, said the discussion generated a small but vocal protest.","\"There were some protesters sending hate message to the students, telling them they are perverts, going to burn in hell, targeting the principal, saying he\u2019s a pedophile,\" Lara said.","But ultimately, students, teachers and parents embraced the plan.","\"The students wanted to have a voice, and they wanted to make a change, and they made a change,\" Lara said."],"targetTitle":"Here\u2019s what happens when schools let transgender students use the bathroom they want","targetDescription":"Even before controversy erupted earlier this year over new state laws limiting trangender rights, many schools across the country had taken proactive steps to make the school environment safer and more welcoming to transgender students.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/politics-government\/national-politics\/cnmky5-milokey\/alternates\/LANDSCAPE_200\/milokey","http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/nation-world\/national\/w57nco-key1\/alternates\/LANDSCAPE_200\/key1","http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/static\/images\/newsobserver\/logo-lg.png","http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/news\/nation-world\/national\/jrzctv-Transgender.png\/ALTERNATES\/LANDSCAPE_1140\/Transgender.png","http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/static\/images\/newsobserver\/logo-sm.png","http:\/\/ece-logger.nandomedia.com:8083\/analysis-logger\/Logger?rt=1&ctxId=10895&contextPath=7041-10601-10892-10895-&pubId=15&cat=&meta=read-story&objId=84797527&type=article&title=Here%e2%80%99s+what+happens+when+schools+let+transgender+students+use+the+bathroom+they+want&url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.newsobserver.com%2fnews%2fnation-world%2fnational%2farticle84797527.html","http:\/\/googleads.g.doubleclick.net\/pagead\/viewthroughconversion\/968074018\/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0","http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/politics-government\/national-politics\/px20ir-Sequence\/alternates\/LANDSCAPE_200\/Sequence"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/nation-world\/national\/article84797527.html","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Nothing.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["The school created two \"all-gender,\" single-stall restrooms in February.

One thing is sure, though: While Donald Trump has thus far appeared to accomplish the impossible, even he has limits.","The reality is that Trump\u2014like policymakers and politicians past, present and future\u2014is operating within the confines of the Overton Window of Political Possibility.","The Overton Window: When You Think About It, It\u2019s So True...","This theory, named for the late Joseph P. Overton of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, is a way to explain how opinions about public policies shift over time and the constraints within which policymakers operate. The Overton Window is the spectrum of ideas that are politically palatable to voters. Although there is no limit to the number of policy ideas available, elected officials are limited to only actively supporting ideas within this window.","For example, consider federal welfare policy. Even though there are loads of ideas about how to address poverty in the United States, politicians support and debate only a select few, such as the minimum wage, earned income tax credit, Medicaid, etc. These are within the Overton Window. Other ideas, such as a guaranteed basic income, even though they may be debated in other countries and supported by economists on both the left and the right, are never seriously considered by politicians because they lie outside the window.","Trump\u2019s Public Policy, Explained","With this in mind, now consider Trump\u2019s recent about-face after he said the victims of the recent Orlando shooting should have been permitted to carry guns into the Pulse nightclub. About a week after making the statement, Trump appeared to backtrack and said he meant nightclub employees and guards should have been armed, not patrons.","This wasn\u2019t just a flip-flop or mere pandering \u2014 it\u2019s more likely that Trump\u2019s movement on the issue is evidence he realized his initial stance was a step outside the Overton Window. While many of his supporters are no doubt staunch believers in the Second Amendment, even the NRA\u2014which endorsed him\u2014said, \"No one thinks that people should go into a nightclub drinking and carrying firearms.\"","Using the Overton Window Theory to Your Advantage","It is important to remember that politicians rarely move the window; more often than not, they only support policies that are deemed acceptable by their constituents. When Trump said Orlando nightclub patrons should have been armed, the backlash showed him that position was outside the window, so he stepped his stance back to one more acceptable to voters.","The lesson in all this is that politicians, as Friedrich Hayek once wrote, are like corks bobbing in the sea. They only go where the current leads them, and it is us \u2014 you, me and our neighbors \u2014 who determine the direction of the current.

You can\u2019t have a \"mass shooting\" without some political ladder-climber coming down hard on the rights of law-abiding Americans. And this time it is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She published this in The Boston Globe today.","The Massachusetts assault weapons ban mirrors the federal ban Congress allowed to expire in 2004. It prohibits the sale of specific weapons like the Colt AR-15 and AK-47 and explicitly bans \"copies or duplicates\" of those weapons. But gun manufacturers have taken it upon themselves to define what a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" weapon is. They market \"state compliant\" copycat versions of their assault weapons to Massachusetts buyers. They sell guns without a flash suppressor or folding or telescoping stock, for example, small tweaks that do nothing to limit the lethalness of the weapon. That will end now. On Wednesday, we are sending a directive to all gun manufacturers and dealers that makes clear that the sale of these copycat assault weapons is illegal in Massachusetts. With this directive, we will ensure we get the full protection intended when lawmakers enacted our assault weapons ban, not the watered-down version of those protections offered by gun manufacturers. The directive specifically outlines two tests to determine what constitutes a \"copy\" or \"duplicate\" of a prohibited weapon. If a gun\u2019s operating system is essentially the same as that of a banned weapon, or if the gun has components that are interchangeable with those of a banned weapon, it\u2019s a \"copy\" or \"duplicate,\" and it is illegal. Assault weapons prohibited under our laws cannot be altered in any way to make their sale or possession legal in Massachusetts.","Yes, you\u2019ve read correctly. Every black rifle, and all of the variants, compliant versions, and anything that any of these yokels think might be used for an \"assault\" is now strictly illegal.","What about all of those guns currently in the law-abiding hands of law-abiding gun owners?","We recognize that most residents who purchased these guns in the past believed they were doing so legally, so this directive will not apply to possession of guns purchased before Wednesday. In the dozen years since the federal assault weapons ban lapsed, only seven states have instituted their own assault weapons ban. Many of those bans have been challenged (unsuccessfully) by the gun industry, and we anticipate our directive may be too. But our job is to enforce state laws and to keep people safe. This directive does both.","Right. Because the criminals who are shooting up campuses and theaters and police protests\u2013they\u2019re all easily stopped by enacting a simple bit of legislation. I could tell you just how many mass murders were thwarted when the perpetrator ran up against a law like this, but I wouldn\u2019t want to let the wind out of the AG\u2019s sail.","In the face of utter inaction by Congress, states have a duty to enact and enforce laws that protect people from gun violence. If Washington won\u2019t use its power to get these guns off our streets, we will. Not only do we have the legal authority to do so, we have a moral obligation to do so.","Wait\u2013to get the guns off the street? I thought she\u2019d just said it was legal to own them if you\u2019d bought them before Wednesday. Now she\u2019s got a moral obligation to get them \"off our streets.\"","If I were in Massachusetts, I\u2019d be feeling a bit paranoid right now.","What does the state consider an \"assault weapon\"?","\"Assault weapon\", shall have the same meaning as a semiautomatic assault weapon as defined in the federal Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, 18 U.S.C. section 921(a)(30) as appearing in such section on September 13, 1994, and shall include, but not be limited to, any of the weapons, or copies or duplicates of the weapons, of any caliber, known as: (i) Avtomat Kalashnikov (AK) (all models); (ii) Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil; (iii) Beretta Ar70 (SC-70); (iv) Colt AR-15; (v) Fabrique National FN\/FAL, FN\/LAR and FNC; (vi) SWD M-10, M-11, M-11\/9 and M-12; (vi) Steyr AUG; (vii) INTRATEC TEC-9, TEC-DC9 and TEC-22; and (viii) revolving cylinder shotguns, such as, or similar to, the Street Sweeper and Striker 12; provided, however, that the term assault weapon shall not include: (i) any of the weapons, or replicas or duplicates of such weapons, specified in appendix A to 18 U.S.C. section 922 as appearing in such appendix on September 13, 1994, as such weapons were manufactured on October 1, 1993; (ii) any weapon that is operated by manual bolt, pump, lever or slide action; (iii) any weapon that has been rendered permanently inoperable or otherwise rendered permanently unable to be designated a semiautomatic assault weapon; (iv) any weapon that was manufactured prior to the year 1899; (v) any weapon that is an antique or relic, theatrical prop or other weapon that is not capable of firing a projectile and which is not intended for use as a functional weapon and cannot be readily modified through a combination of available parts into an operable assault weapon; (vi) any semiautomatic rifle that cannot accept a detachable magazine that holds more than five rounds of ammunition; or (vii) any semiautomatic shotgun that cannot hold more than five rounds of ammunition in a fixed or detachable magazine.","Time for some crafty legal eagles to start dismantling this gibberish."],"targetTitle":"BREAKING: This State Just Banned the Sale of ALL Semi-Auto Rifles, Effective Immediately","targetDescription":"Well, we all knew it was coming.

Now computer simulations suggest this could have been possible if the ruler had sex about once a day for 32 years.","Ismai\u0308l, who reigned from 1672 to 1727, was the first great sultan of the Moroccan Alaouite dynasty, the current royal house of the kingdom. He was Sharifian \u2014 that is, he claimed descent from Muhammad, the founder of Islam.","Ismai\u0308l's rule was the longest in Moroccan history, and toward its end he controlled the country with an army of more than 150,000 men. Ismai\u0308l was infamously ruthless \u2014 his reign is said to have begun with the display of 400 heads at the city of Fez, most of them from enemy chiefs, and over the next 55 years it is estimated he killed more than 30,000 people, not including those in battle.","Any suspicion of adultery against Ismai\u0308l was severely punished. The women were either strangled by the sultan himself, or their breasts were cut off, or their teeth torn out. Men who merely looked at one of his wives or concubines were punished by death.","According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Ismai\u0308l fathered 888 children, the greatest number of progeny for anyone throughout history that can be verified. Based on reports by Dominique Busnot, a French diplomat who frequently traveled to Morocco, the sultan may actually have had 1,171 children from four wives and 500 concubines by 1704. At that time, Ismai\u0308l was 57 and had ruled for 32 years.","Some researchers claimed it was unlikely Ismai\u0308l could have fathered that many offspring, noting that women are only fertile for a small window each month, that sperm usually do not fertilize eggs, and that infertility often afflicts women, especially in the developing world. However, other scientists argued women are more fertile than those doubting Ismai\u0308l had said.","To solve this question, scientists developed computer simulations to see how many times Ismai\u0308l had to have sex each day to have 1,171 children in 32 years. They found the sultan could have set this record.","\"We were as conservative as possible with our calculations, and Moulay could still achieve this outcome,\" study lead author Elisabeth Oberzaucher, an anthropologist at the University of Vienna, told Live Science.","The simulations were based on a variety of models of conception. For instance, one set of simulations assumed the menstrual cycles of women do not synchronize, while another suggested they could. Other factors included how good Ismail's sperm were at fertilizing women's eggs as he aged and how women often may look more sexually attractive when they are most fertile during their menstrual cycles.","The simulations suggest Ismai\u0308l needed to have sex an average of 0.83 to 1.43 times per day in order to father 1,171 children in 32 years. Moreover, the sultan did not need a harem of four wives and 500 concubines to sire that many offspring \u2014 the researchers suggest he needed a harem of only 65 to 110 women.","Although the models of conception the researchers employed ultimately all found that Ismai\u0308l could have actually had all these children, \"the results from them were all quite different from each other,\" Oberzaucher said. \"This really emphasizes to us how important it is to choose the right model for studies of reproduction \u2014 you really want to know what kind of women you actually are doing your calculations with, thinking about where women are in their life cycles and the sexual habits of women.\"","Oberzaucher and her colleague Karl Grammer detailed their findings Feb. 14 in the journal PLOS ONE."],"targetTitle":"'Bloodthirsty' Moroccan Ruler Really Could Have Fathered 1,000 Kids, Computer Simulation Shows","targetDescription":"Sultan Moulay Isma\u00efl of Morocco, \"The Bloodthirsty,\" reputedly sired hundreds of children and perhaps more than a 1,000.

If you love pot and natural medicine, she\u2019s someone you want to know.","Unfortunately, despite the abundance of healing Dr. Jenkins gives back to the world, she went through great loss to get where she is today. \"My oldest daughter Kiona was diagnosed with two different types of brain tumors in 2002 when she was eight years old, and I questioned whether chemotherapy and radiation was the right course of action for treatment for her,\" explains Dr. Jenkins. \"I was informed that the State of California knows what\u2019s better for my daughter than I do and that if I did anything different than conventional treatment, then I\u2019d be acting outside of medical advice and that I would be a threat to her. Unfortunately, I was forced to accept, but while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation, I started researching and studying for my doctorate, and figuring out other holistic alternatives.\"","Kiona passed away in January 2006, 12 days shy of her twelfth birthday. Dr. Jenkins now practices in her honor, going back to her roots and using ancestral healing techniques.","\"My family is from the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians, so we have Native American lineage and my grandfather is a native healer,\" she explains. \"I just went back to my native roots and just researched.\" Along with her work as a healer, Dr. Jenkins strives to create room for minorities in the cannabis industry that is too often dominated by white men due to financial advantages and their inherent privilege.","\"There\u2019s a privilege that is associated with being a white male in this country, you don\u2019t have that same type of fear that other minority groups or other people do and you\u2019re more in a position to take a risk in jumping into this industry,\" explains Dr. Jenkins, who has also been a part of the Minority Business Council for three years.","Her advice to women and other minorities looking to break through? \"Be fearless and strong in your conviction. Know what you stand for and know what you are trying to accomplish and don\u2019t let anything get in your way. Surround yourself with other like-minded people who can be your support system and your tribe and then educate yourself, because education is going to be what\u2019s going to help you persevere. Because people are going to challenge you all the time. But if you can come back with those challenges with hard evidence and experience, and really speak to the level of professionalism that this industry is going to command, you\u2019ll be taken seriously.\"","2. Rachel K. Gillette, Attorney","An unfortunate aspect of the cannabis industry is that due to lingering federal laws and constantly evolving local ones, if you work with weed, you'll likely need a lawyer at some point. That\u2019s where Rachel Gillette comes in","an attorney who has been working with the regulated cannabis industry since 2010. Her areas of practice include corporate licensing compliance, tax law for marijuana businesses, and pretty much anything related to the operations of cannabis businesses regulated by the state of Colorado.","\"I\u2019ve always been an advocate for the legalization of marijuana,\" says Gillette. \"So in 2010, when I saw the state of Colorado was going to be regulating, being the first state in the nation to do so, I decided to quit my job and to start my own practice which focused on the representation of these newly-formed business enterprises.\" At the time, Gillette was taking a major risk since few larger firms were ready to take on cannabis clients. However, Gillette\u2019s instincts and boldness paid off and she staked her claim in what is now a booming industry.","Gillette says her favorite part the job is that marijuana law is constantly evolving \"We\u2019re doing something that has never been done before, so there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to blaze the trail, so to speak, no pun intended,\" she explains. Not to mention, working to help victims of America\u2019s War On Drugs: \"We\u2019ve had 40 years of a failed drug war, our fathers, our brothers, our children are incarcerated at alarming rates unfortunately for minority populations, and disproportional rates for minority populations, and as women, we shouldn\u2019t stand for that anymore.\"","3. Lynne Lyman, California State Director for the Drug Policy Alliance","While California cannabis users celebrate their state\u2019s recent marijuana legalization accomplishment, (nice Hollyweed sign), Lynne Lyman\u2019s work is just getting started. She's the California state director of the non-profit organization Drug Policy Alliance, \"the leading organization advancing drug policies grounded in science, compassion, health, and human rights.\"","\"We always say November 8th wasn\u2019t the end, it was the beginning,\" she explains. \"That\u2019s true with most laws","often policymakers forget to think about the implementation piece and sometimes that\u2019s the most important piece, because if you pass a law and it doesn\u2019t get implemented, then it\u2019s as if it didn\u2019t pass.\"","Along with working to fund cannabis research, Lyman\u2019s biggest passion is making marijuana and marijuana-advocacy communities more inclusive, especially by creating space for those were were a vital part of the weed industry before it was sanctioned by mainstream society.","\"You\u2019re walking in today to this whole nice legal world where everybody can wear a name tag that says they\u2019re with some cannabis association, whereas five years ago even, people were still doing federal time for having a dispensary,\" Lyman explains. \"The advice I give to all of the people who come into the cannabis industry is understand the history. There\u2019s the sense that people are just waltzing in as if it\u2019s just any other industry. I want to discourage that and remind that a lot of people have died, people have been incarcerated, they\u2019ve had their families destroyed. Making sure you\u2019re a good neighbor, and you\u2019re working with the community that you are based in.\"","Lyman says that while we see often see white men as the faces of legal weed businesses, that doesn't mean they're the ones who laid the groundwork for legalization in the first place. \"One thing that has been true historically in the cannabis movement is that it\u2019s been men\u2019s faces at the forefront and yet it\u2019s been a lot of women doing the behind-the-scenes work,\" explains Lyman. \"I\u2019m in room after room saying it cannot be all white men in the industry. You have to find a way to expand and let other people in. That\u2019s a policy priority for DPA.\"","4.

Maybe it's because the term reactor usually implies a manmade structure. But in this case, the reactor is a region of natural uranium within the Earth's crust, found in Okla, Gabon. Uranium is naturally radioactive, and the conditions in this rocky area happened to be just right to cook up some nuclear reactions.","The natural reactor must have annoyed nuclear scientists: The first nuclear reactor to produce electricity started up in 1951, and this only produced a trivial amount of energy. The pile of rock in the ground in Okla, on the other hand, created nuclear power around 2 billion years ago!","It was discovered in 1972, when some French scientists took uranium ore from the mine in Gabon to test its uranium content. Typically, uranium ore is made up of three types (isotopes) of uranium, each one with a different number of neutrons: Uranium 238, which is the most abundant, uranium 234, which is the rarest, and uranium 235, which nuclear scientists are most interested in because it can sustain nuclear chain reactions.","One would expect to find that the uranium ore is composed of 0.720% uranium 235, since that is the percentage found in other rock samples from the Earth's crust, the Moon and even meteorites. However, these French scientists found something fishy: The uranium sample only contained 0.717% of uranium 235. What might seem to be a minor discrepancy of 0.003% is very significant with regards to uranium.","That meant that, back at the mine, around 200 kilograms (around 440 pounds) of uranium 235 appeared to be missing. It hadn't been lost or stolen. Instead, this missing 0.003% had undergone nuclear fission and split into other atoms. This conclusion may very well have furrowed some brows since there are three very specific conditions that a reactor needs to churn out energy continuously. And as even scientists had struggled to create a nuclear reactor, it seemed unlikely that nature just happened to create one purely by accident.","Unlikely, but not impossible, because that is exactly what happened.","The conditions that the natural reactor happened to fulfill are as follows.","The first was owning a good percentage of Uranium 235 to fuel the reaction. While 0.720% might seem small, it's perfect for nuclear fission, and when the ore samples from Okla are compared to other samples from all over the world, it is likely that this was the percentage over 2 billion years ago when the reactor started.","The second condition is a source of neutrons. Uranium 235 decays naturally into thorium and releases a neutron in the process. This neutron can then whoosh towards another Uranium 235 atom and start the fission process. Nuclear fission is when an atom breaks apart into smaller atoms, usually releasing energy in the process. This neutron fuses with a Uranium 235, and together they combine to form Uranium 236, which is unstable. The Uranium 236 is then overwhelmed with instability and splits, creating a variety of smaller, stable atoms and some neutrons. These neutrons can then happily shoot towards other atoms and continue the chain reaction.","The nuclear reactor had a supply of a regulating substance as well: a flow of natural groundwater. As the atoms started to split, they released neutrons as well as energy. The water would slow down the neutrons, but the energy would heat up the water. After a time, the water would get so hot that it would start to boil off. Eventually, enough of the water would have boiled away until there wasn't enough left in the reactor to slow down the neutrons. The neutrons started shooting off into the ground without reacting with anything, and the reaction would stop. Then, the natural flow of groundwater would trickle in until there was enough water to start the whole process again. This watery cycle probably continued for hundreds of thousands of years.","Sadly, all good days are numbered, even for a happy natural reactor: The levels of uranium 235 got used up and the level was too low to sustain any more meaningful reactions. The reactor eventually slowed to a stop, leaving only a few traces behind that it ever existed \u2013 including the enigma of the \"missing uranium.\"","Featured Image: Danilo Russo\/Flickr","Source: Naturally Occurring Nuclear Fission"],"targetTitle":"Is There Really A 2 Billion-Year-Old Nuclear Reactor In Africa?","targetDescription":"An ancient\u00a0nuclear reactor that was churning away\u00a02 billion years ago sounds like a fabricated myth.

By transferring our minds into machines we could live forever, unmoored from the feebleness of our physical bodies. The concepts of death and bereavement as we know them now would cease to exist.","Currently the idea lives within whitepapers and sci-fi movies, and the only thing (most) researchers agree on is that it won't be possible for a really long time. But while we're far from achieving that pinnacle of immorality, technology in the here-and-now has already started giving us a sliver of eternal life while shaping how we grieve our loved ones if and when they die.","The Silicon Valley-startup Eterni.me aims to let people preserve their \"most important thoughts, stories, and memories\" in an artificially intelligent system that could ultimately communicate conversationally with others once its creator is gone. Such an avatar could both soothe the bereaved and allow future generations to know much more about their great-great-grandparents.","Since the company had a splashy launch two years ago it has progressed with crypt-like quietness. Their site is mostly unchanged, save for the counter of people signed up for early access that rises each day. But now it says it plans to launch revamped version of its app to a test group in early 2017. The app will connect to a person's Facebook account (with other social integration planned) and launch micro-conversations based on their daily activities. Ultimately that process will build the AI's understanding of its subject, and be able to function like a smarter, more personalized version of the chatbots you can already interact with today.","\"We chose this approach because we would like to help people solve the 'blank page syndrome' we have often seen when somebody tries to write in their diary,\" explains Eterni.me founder Marius Ursache. \"We want to encourage people to start curating their digital legacy and we will do that by triggering conversations based on previously collected data of what they did, felt, or experienced.\"","Though Eterni.me's new app will be collecting all this information, the neural network backbone won't be able to turn that mass of unruly data into engaging conversations yet.","\"The artificial intelligence that we need requires a lot of effort and time \u2014 it may take years,\" Ursache says. \"A lot of the people who expressed interest in Eterni.me don't have this time. This forces us to use more or less the the approach of the cryonics initiatives \u2014 preservation first, technology second.\"","Meanwhile, a semblance of the company's vision has already come to \"life.\"","Earlier this year, entrepreneur Eugenia Kudya created an AI-powered chatbot in honor of her friend Roman Mazurenko, who died tragically in 2015. Kudya and other mourners could \"speak\" with Roman by talking to the bot or asking it questions \u2014 its responses would be based on the thousands of texts messages and photos she had fed the neural network controlling its artificial intelligence.","While the Roman bot couldn't narrate stories in the same way that Eterni.me envisions, it wrote in his voice. Talking to the bot helped Kudya grieve and made her feel more connected to her friend.","Inspired by the personal conversations that other people had with Roman's bot, she's now working on Replika, a new product that, like Eterni.me, will collect a person's stories and memories and learn to mimic their conversational mannerisms by texting with them. The bot would first ask you about the past and eventually prod you about your daily life. Your friends could talk to your Replika, too, asking it personal questions or using it to schedule plans with the real you.","\"It's all about making people a little bit more open about themselves ... a little more vulnerable,\" Kudya says. \"Now even the first Replikas we have on the app can tell you a lot about the person that trained it.\"","The goal of the platform, she explains, isn't to let everyone create their own \"Roman\" that will live on after they die, but to give everyone a kind of \"friend\" that is there every day to talk to, to make you \"more connected with your friends and yourself.\"","But intention or not, a person's Replika bot would be able to keep responding like you and telling your stories after you died in the same way that Eterni.me's avatars could.","Over 100,000 people have reserved their Replika \"name\" and 17,000 applied for early testing of the app, but only 1,200 were given access to the beta version. Kudya was vague about when she thinks the technology will actually be good enough for the general public.","The natural progression of Eterni.me or Replika's ideas would be to combine the AI with realistic digital 3D avatars (something Eterni.me eventually plans to do to, but has back-burnered while it works on the first part of its mission). Facebook is researching how to create life-like virtual reality avatars as are a host of different startups, including one called XXarray that explicitly envisions helping people create a digital legacy.","Long-time VR researcher Jacki Morie coined the phrase \"the ultimate selfie\" to describe how she predicts that current technologies could eventually combine to create digital avatars that would not only would look like us, but move like us, and learn from us, too.","She imagines that in the not-so-distant future, when using an avatar in VR is fairly common practice, people will be able to train a digital surrogate that could live on after they're gone.","\"You'll be scanned and have this 3D construct that can then walk around in virtual worlds and it will retain the things that you did within an AI,\" she says. \"This kind of avatar could become a repository for our experiences and our memories.\"","While the idea of talking to a dead relative through a digitized ghost may seem creepy \u2014 edging into bizarre \"uncanny valley\" territory \u2014 experts say that, on principle, it's actually a completely natural progression of the way that people have always grieved.","Heather Servaty-Seib, a grief researcher and Purdue professor says that it's in line with the \"continuing bonds\" theory of bereavement. Death changes the form of your relationship with someone, not the fact that you have one.","Many already talk to the dead through a smartphone screen instead of at a graveyard. (Or through a phone booth, like in Otsuchi, Japan where tsunami survivors \"call\" their lost loved ones.) Facebook allows people to \"memorialize\" the pages of the deceased and those pages often become a public and wide-reaching digital wake where friends and family share photos, memories, or their messages to the dead.","AfterTalk prompts the bereaved to write letters to their loved ones that can either be private or shared with a therapist or family member. DeadSocial allows users to set up a curated Facebook-page of sorts where their love ones can commune once they've passed. They can even choose to schedule personal messages that will send from beyond the grave.","If people have always found ways now to talk to the dead, could it be problematic if they start talking back?","Both Servaty-Seib and grief therapist Dr. Bob Neymeyer agree that new ways to communicate with the dead could be healthy for many patients. Still, there are some potential pratfalls related to how we mourn. It could be damaging to children, who generally don't fully grasp the concept of death, Servaty-Seib says. Or it could be addictive to people already prone to focusing too much on the dead, deemphasizing other relationships and not moving forward, says Neymeyer. He's had patients who have listened to the dead's voicemail over and over or spent days on end at their grave.","\"Now imagine if someone had an extensive, almost inexhaustible archive of conversation available with the deceased,\" he says.","Beyond the psychological implications, palliative care doctor Mark Taubert says that he doesn't think that it will be technically feasible for the tech to answer the kinds of burning questions people will have for their digitized loved ones.","\"I often find that the questions a grieving friend or relative may have for the deceased are often quite difficult to answer, for example, 'Did you ever forgive me for what I did in ....?'\" he says. How could an artificially intelligent system taught simply to mimic your style and echo your memories tackle that difficult question in any real way?","Digital legacy tools like Eterni.me or DeathLogic don't just serve the people left behind. They are very, very much about the person who is dying or thinking about their own eventual death.","These services offer a way for us to build monuments to ourselves.

Historically, white women have had the highest breast cancer incidence rates among women aged 40 years and older, and they still do with about 127 cases per 100,000 compared with 118 cases per 100,000 black women. However, incidence rates are now converging among white and African-American women, particularly among those aged 50 years to 59 years. \"Although the incidence haven't declined, we have made strides in the effort to improve the survival rate. Death rates have declined by 34 percent since 1990. However, not all ethnic groups are enjoying this improved survival,\" Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told HealthDay . Breast cancer death rates have dropped by 34 percent since 1990 in all racial\/ethnic groups except American Indians\/Alaska Natives, while African-American women continue to have the poorest breast cancer survival of any racial\/ethnic group. In June, a JAMA study showed that black women are less likely to survive a breast cancer diagnosis within five years because they undergo fewer screenings, have poorer health at the time of diagnosis and have more advanced disease by the time the cancer is found. Authors of of the ACS report also noted that reproductive history and obesity are more strongly linked to ER-positive breast cancer, the form of the disease more common among white women, while lower socioeconomic status has been linked to raised risk for ER-negative breast cancer, which is more common among African Americans."],"targetTitle":"Breast Cancer Rates On The Rise In Black Women, And More Health News This Week","targetDescription":"An estimated 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer and 39,620 breast cancer deaths are expected to occur among U.S. women in 2013.

An international trip, he tells USA TODAY.","Let friends in your social network know what you are reading about","Pokemon trainers flocked from around the Bay Area to attend San Francisco's Pokemon Go Crawl where they met fellow trainers and talked Pokemon over discounted themed drinks.","Nick Johnson is the first person to announce he has collected every Poke\u0301mon in the popular mobile game Poke\u0301mon Go. That is, all 142 virtual monsters that users have confirmed seeing in the wild of North America.","So now what?","Off on an international trip to catch the Poke\u0301mon elsewhere in the world \u2014 underwritten by an international travel company.","Marriott Rewards has offered to sponsor Johnson to go to Europe, Japan and Australia to catch the regionally based Poke\u0301mon and finish his collection, he told USA TODAY Friday. A Marriott spokesman confirmed the trip.","\u200bUsing GPS and augmented reality, the game developed by Niantic Labs invites players to catch the colorful Poke\u0301mon monsters best known from Nintendo games and trading cards of the 1990s. In the game, the monsters appear on real-life sidewalks and park benches when a player has the app open \u2014 a scenario that's encouraged a mass public-walking binge by millions.","\"I feel great,\" Johnson said. \"I was getting a lot of rest and exercise and meeting new people. I\u2019m a lot healthier \u2014 I think I lost about 8-10 pounds.\"","Launched in early July , the hardcore users are now looking for the rare Poke\u0301mon.","Mr. Mime , Farfetch'd and Kangaskhan are reportedly only available in the wild in Europe, Asia and Australiasia, respectively. However, it is rumored these Pokemon can be hatched from rare eggs in North America that users can pick up at PokeStops.","\"I\u2019ve talked to dozens and dozens of people who have hatched 100's of eggs and no one can hatch or catch them (in North America) as far as I know,\" Johnson said.","The Brooklyn-based tech worker announced this week he had nabbed the 142 local monsters on Reddit with a screenshot of his Pokedex, and later confirmed this feat to Business Insider","He owes his new fame to plain old shoe leather.","Central Park . Many times they would get to know fellow Poke\u0301mon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when Poke\u0301mon tend to spawn. After getting off at work around 6:00 pm at Applico, a platform innovation company , Johnson would meet up with his girlfriend, have dinner and then together head down to Poke\u0301mon hotspots such as Grand Army Plaza in. Many times they would get to know fellow Poke\u0301mon trainers (players) searching in the park and then they would wait for the top or the bottom of the hour when Poke\u0301mon tend to spawn.","If she decided to leave before him, he said she would give him her phone to help her collect more monsters and he usually found himself heading home around 12 a.m. or 1 p.m., the normal time he goes to sleep.","Johnson's iPhone Health App stated he has walked an average of 8 miles per day since the game was released on July 6th.","Johnson said that he had a couple of nights, when he got around the 135 Poke\u0301mon mark, that kept him out till 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. This trainer's solution: heavy doses of black tea in the morning.","Even so, he said he doesn't feel like the game affected his professional life, stating that Poke\u0301mon Go is a gaming platform and he works for a platform innovation company, so he felt like the game translated back into the work he did everyday. He's even recently co-authored a book about the platform business model.","He said his passion for platforms like these are a big part of what motivated him to play the game as much as he did. Beside growing up playing the Poke\u0301mon games, of course.","But staying out till 5 a.m. isn't what Johnson considers to be the most drastic measure he took for Poke\u0301mon, citing a story of trying to catch a Porygon. He said when he noticed there was one close-by, he went to search for it, but the Poke\u0301mon Go radar was down so he had to order an Uber drive to drive him around until he eventually found it.","\"That is above and beyond anything else I did to catch one,\" Johnson said. \"I was close to the end so it was extra motivation.\"","As for other fellow trainers hoping to catch them all, his first piece of advice is to talk to trainers for tips on where to find certain Poke\u0301mon.","\"I probably wouldn\u2019t be here, having caught them all, if I hadn't got those great tips like the Dratinis in Jersey City,\" Johnson said.","Secondly, always make sure you walk in a straight line when trying to hatch an egg because the game uses a distance displacement calculation so walking in circles or zigzags won't do you any good.","\"I learned that the hard way,\" Johnson said.","For now, he's playing casually as something fun to do with his girlfriend and friends but is pouring his energy back into Applico. At least for now until he takes his international Poke\u0301mon catching trip.","\"My childhood dreams of being a Poke\u0301mon master have come true.\""],"targetTitle":"We found out what happens after you catch every Pok\u00e9mon","targetDescription":"Nick Johnson has caught every Pok\u00e9mon in Pok\u00e9mon Go that is available in the U.S. So now what?

(Hint: It ain\u2019t good.)"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In the age of stickiest-of-ickiest-and-rising THC percentages, it appears the United States government still supplies researchers with low grade brick weed you probably smoked in high school. Actually, it's worse than the weed you smoked in high school. ","According to reports from PBS and the Washington Post, all marijuana used in research must be supplied by the federal government, and the pot that the government has been handing out looks like trash. ","Government marijuana looks nothing like the real stuff. See for yourself. https:\/\/t.co\/UKNSYwqPWQ pic.twitter.com\/IbQv8p5NWu","\u2014 Washington Post (@washingtonpost) March 13, 2017","Though it's relatively simple to grow, the quality of cannabis you can purchase (legally or illegally) in the United States can vary greatly. Lighting, air quality, humidity and pests can all play a massive role in the end product, so growing weed may be pretty easy, but growing great weed can be pretty taxing. ","As the Post points out, when researchers are testing the effects of marijuana, they need to test the real thing that people are actually growing, buying and consuming. But the cannabis being supplied to researchers currently is far from something you'd typically buy in a dispensary in Denver. Or getting from an illegal delivery service in New York City. ","And while weed comes in plenty of colors, shapes, densities and sizes, the pot analyzed by PBS and the Post looks extremely yellow and filled with stems.","Sue Sisley, a researcher with MAPS studying the medical effects of marijuana on U.S. veterans suffering from PTSD told PBS the weed supplied to them for the study doesn't even smell like weed.","'It doesn\u2019t resemble cannabis. It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis.'","\"It doesn\u2019t resemble cannabis. It doesn\u2019t smell like cannabis,\" she said.","Not only is the weed bad, but Sisley claims it was moldy as well. So the government clearly doesn't have it together when it comes to growing pot.","All of the cannabis provided for medical research comes from a 12-acre farm located at the University of Mississippi. The farm is run by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), and is the only facility licensed by the DEA to grow pot for research, since marijuana remains a schedule 1 drug to the DEA. (It's classified in a category with heroin and ecstasy, which also makes a lot of sense.)","Rick Doblin, MAPS\u2019 director, blasted NIDA's capabilities by telling PBS, \"They\u2019re in no way capable of assuming the rights and responsibilities for handling a drug that we\u2019re hoping to be approved by the FDA as prescription medicine. \"","When confronted about the mold and potency, NIDA and the University of Mississippi told PBS that neither test the samples for mold before they're shipped.","Sisely had the samples provided by the government tested by an independent lab in Colorado as a part of typical protocol. There they found high levels of total yeast and mold in some samples, as well as potency that didn't match what they had ordered. One sample was supposed to contain 13 percent THC \u2014 it reportedly had just 8 percent. ","Shockingly, 13 percent THC is the highest percentage NIDA offers. In Colorado you can walk into a dispensary and buy weed that is easily 20 percent, sometimes upwards of 30 percent. ","NIDA blamed the mold problem on the lab, saying they didn't handle it properly when they left it in a refrigerator for two days instead of freezing it. MAPS fired back, saying the weed with elevated total yeast and mold counts \"were found in samples that never left the freezer before testing,\" according to PBS.","While it was determined the mold variety in the cannabis was not harmful to adults, it's clear that the United States needs to form better quality control and standards testing for cannabis, be it medical, recreational or for research. Regardless of how you feel about marijuana, the effects of the plant deserve to be properly researched, and right now, it appears they aren't. ","Though there way may be hope on the horizon: The DEA announced in the summer that it would start to allow other bulk growers the ability to provide cannabis for medical research, though none have yet been approved.

(Photo by Jose Luis Villegas\/the Sacramento Bee via AP)","Lester Holt, anchor of \"NBC Nightly News\" will moderate Monday's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Previous moderators have advised this year's questioners to be as invisible as possible, but scrutiny is inevitable.","Before the lights go on, here are five things to know about Holt:","Holt is a registered Republican","Donald Trump has spent the weeks leading up to the general election debates predicting unfair treatment by the moderators. He says the media using criticism of Matt Lauer's performance during a candidates forum this month to pressure the moderators into attack mode.","\"They're hitting Matt Lauer, and that's sort of indicative of what they're \u2014 they're trying to game the system,\" Trump told Fox News last weekend. \"They want \u2014 and this, I think, is terrible \u2014 they want the hosts to go after Trump. And that's what they're doing by gaming the system.\"","Conspiratorial as Trump's theory is, it can't be disproven. But the shot he took at Holt can be.","\"Lester is a Democrat,\" Trump told Bill O'Reilly last week. \"It\u2019s a phony system. They are all Democrats. It\u2019s a very unfair system.\"","These are the people who will be lobbing questions at Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton when they go head-to-head at the 2016 presidential debates. The first debate is slated for September 26. (Sarah Parnass\/The Washington Post)","Time magazine checked the voter rolls in New York, and it turns out Holt is actually a registered Republican. Trump still might find things to complain about Monday night, but a case for partisan bias against him will be tough to make.","Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992","Holt, whose grandparents immigrated to the United Stats from Jamaica, is the first black moderator of a general election presidential debate since Carole Simpson in 1992. Gwen Ifill moderated vice-presidential debates in 2004 and 2008, and Bernard Shaw moderated the VP debate in 2000, but it has been 24 years since a black journalist moderated a debate between the major-party nominees for president.","Holt, whom NBC declined to make available for interviews before the debate, does not talk about his race often. He did say this to the Chicago Tribune in 1995, when the paper profiled the then-anchor of WBBM-TV's nightly newscast: \"Everyone knows I'm black. I am who I am. This is the person that Lester Sr. and June Holt raised, and I make no apology for it. At the same time, I'm never going to pull a race card to get what I want. You can't have it both ways.\"","Dominic Carter, a fellow black TV journalist who moderated one of Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign debates in 2006, said Holt's selection is significant, but viewers should not expect his background to influence his questioning.","\"We are journalists first,\" Carter said. \"That's a huge distinction. We're not there to advocate on issues relating to African Americans. We're there advocating and asking questions on behalf of the American people. You don't want people to put you in the box of the black guy doing the debate. So you have to be over and above in terms of fairness and professionalism.\"","He's not really into the Twitter","Holt, 57, has not tweeted in almost a month. He was fairly active while in Rio de Janeiro during NBC's coverage of the Olympics, sharing images like these:","Scratching item off list of things I've never done before a newscast. Beach volleyball. Tonight @NBCNightlyNews pic.twitter.com\/CRmpnCcpNU \u2014 Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 7, 2016","Joining on stage for some Brazilian Jazz in Rio tonight. #BoyFromIpanema pic.twitter.com\/xJ5MoYGtPZ \u2014 Lester Holt (@LesterHoltNBC) August 13, 2016","In general, however, it is not unusual for Holt to go several days or even a week between tweets. His relative disinterest in social media stands in contrast to Trump's obsession.","He moderated a Democratic primary debate","Holt got to practice his moderating skills at a Democratic debate in January, though he split questioning duties that night with Andrea Mitchell.","He was not involved in any major clashes during the debate but showed a willingness to ask tough questions, such as when he asked Clinton about the \"reset button\" with Russia during her tenure as secretary of state.","\"Secretary Clinton, you famously handed Russia's foreign minister a reset button in 2009,\" Holt said. \"Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea, fomented a war in Ukraine, provided weapons that downed an airliner and launched operations, as we just did discuss, to support Assad in Syria. As president, would you hand Vladimir Putin a reset button?\"","Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree","Apparently the secret to becoming a big-time political anchor is not graduating from college. \"Meet the Press\" anchor Chuck Todd never finished his studies at George Washington University. (He told me he plans to do so before his kids go to college.) The late ABC anchor Peter Jennings never even went to college, dropping out of high school.","Holt left California State University-Sacramento after two years to work at a radio station in San Francisco. The Sacramento Bee told the story last year:","Lester Holt Sr. was concerned in 1979 when he learned that his son was planning to drop out of California State University, Sacramento, to work at a San Francisco radio station. But he wasn\u2019t as worried as his wife, June. \"She predicted poverty and failure,\" he said with a laugh. But the Rancho Cordova couple gave their blessing, firm in the belief that Lester Jr. would go far with hard work, talent and a likeable personality in his chosen field of broadcast journalism.","Things worked out okay. Since dropping out, Holt has received honorary doctorates from Cal State Sacramento and Pepperdine University."],"targetTitle":"5 things to know about presidential debate moderator Lester Holt","targetDescription":"He's not really into the Twitter.","targetKeywords":"Lester Holt, debate, moderator, Clinton, Trump, NBC","targetMedia":["http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=60&h=60&filter=nearest&fmt=png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=480&h=270&filter=nearest&fmt=png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/washingtonpost_black_32.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=138&h=92&filter=nearest&fmt=png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/jsp\/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:8:000000005010_2017:-1:000000000000","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wm_tb_prv_off.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wm_tb_nxt_on.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_960w\/2010-2019\/Wires\/Images\/2016-09-02\/AP\/Campaign_2016-Debate_Moderators-5d68b.jpg&w=480","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/blogs\/fact-checker\/files\/2016\/08\/Untitled.png&w=480","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/wp-eng-static.washingtonpost.com\/author_images\/borchersc.jpg?ts=1449144756528&w=180&h=180","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/push_notifications\/notification_denied_v1.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wayback-toolbar-logo.png","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_1484w\/2010-2019\/Wires\/Images\/2016-09-02\/AP\/Campaign_2016-Debate_Moderators-5d68b.jpg","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-stat\/politics\/testshadeflower45.png","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/sb.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819im_\/https:\/\/me.effectivemeasure.net\/em_image"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160926112819\/https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/the-fix\/wp\/2016\/09\/25\/5-things-to-know-about-presidential-debate-moderator-lester-holt\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"He's the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992, not really into the Twitter, moderated a Democratic primary debate, has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree, and a registered Republican.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["Holt is a registered Republican","Holt is the first black presidential debate moderator since 1992","He's not really into the Twitter","He moderated a Democratic primary debate","Holt has two honorary doctorates, but no bachelor's degree"],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,0],[3,31]],[[10,0],[10,64]],[[15,0],[15,32]],[[20,0],[20,40]],[[24,0],[24,58]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":188}

I'm one of those people who gets uncomfortable extremely easily, so I have sympathy for people that look similarly awkward when it comes up that I have obsessive compulsive disorder.","I also get the desire to not only sympathize, but to empathize by finding some way to relate to this very important, and often dominating, part of my life. Which is the only reason I can assume that I hear this (or some version of this) response so often: \"OMG same! I keep my closet perfectly color-coded!\"","Now, it's not always color-coding closets -- it could be anything from polishing silverware, to double-checking locks, to eating the same thing every day for breakfast. And yes, OCD symptoms present both in a variety of ways as well as varying degrees. But unless you are educated on the disorder, have seen a therapist, or have some sort of confirmation other than your own unfortunate desire to connect with me about this -- I'm going to be honest and let you know I really, really don't want to hear your superficial self-diagnosis.","Here's why: It's insensitive to diminish OCD to the one, slightly obsessive or compulsive behavior you have. It shows a serious lack of understanding of what OCD is and does, and is a subtle yet powerful way of saying \"Oh, we all have that! It's not that big of a deal.\"","Because even if color-coding your closet is an annoying habit -- and I'll give it to you, maybe even an \"obsession\" or \"compulsion\" -- your comment comparing this to actual, medically-diagnosed OCD comes off as an underhanded way of telling me that it's not only something that everyone has, but something that doesn't warrant psychiatric or therapeutic attention. For my disorder, it's a response that I would equate to saying that you understand someone's pain over the death of an parent because you once had a pet that died. Thanks for the effort, but no thanks for comparing my dead mother to your dead goldfish.","Now, I know this isn't your intention, and I try to keep this in mind as I grind my teeth and try to explain somehow, that no, that really is not the same thing. And don't get me wrong, I'm happy to explain it to you -- but I would much rather do so in response to a question or genuine interest, not a backhanded attempt at empathy.","My OCD has affected me for as long as I can remember -- and although it's now managed well enough where it's not necessarily something people notice on their own (a proud accomplishment, if I do say so myself), there have been times it has been debilitating: severe anxiety; bleeding knuckles from obsessive washing; rapid weight drops from stress-related appetite loss; intricate and obscenely repetitive bedtime routines.","I'm happy to explain this to you, to answer any and all questions -- anyone who knows me knows I'm not exactly a shy or private person.

If you download the open source version and host it yourself, Odoo can be free for everyone, though you\u2019ll have to support it yourself.","Odoo is designed as an ERP, but thanks to the software\u2019s add-on app layout, you can make it as large or small as your business requires. For inventory management, you\u2019ll probably want to take advantage of at least the warehouse management system and perhaps the purchase or point of sales system as well.","Since it\u2019s an ERP, all of your data will be combined in the backend, so purchases can flow into inventory and into your accounting, as well. Odoo online can be a great open source answer for a small business, while larger businesses can get a lot out of the full featured software.","ABC Inventory is the child of Almyta Control System. It\u2019s a free package for a single user, allowing you to manage multiple warehouses, serial numbers, warranties, and a host of other inventory related data. This free version is really designed to be run on one computer, though, as multiple workstations can\u2019t sync the same data.","As with almost all free options, you\u2019ll be supplying the support \u2014 though there are some forums to give you a hand if things get tough. ABC is geared specifically toward smaller companies that don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles that come with a bigger system.","Final thoughts","All of these systems can manage most small business inventory requirements, with many offering flexibility to move up as your company grows. Odoo may have the strongest position for an existing large company, but the low prices for its competitors mean that there are plenty of options within most budgets.","What other free inventory software solutions are out there?

{"postId":"4zvwfz","postText":["Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Look at a photo of a street scene from the '70s or early '80s, and a lot of things look pretty much the same as today. Most of the buildings are similar. People's clothes, on the whole, aren't all that different, give or take a few shoulder pads.","One thing stands out: all of the cars look super boxy, especially compared with the curving, rounded exteriors of virtually every car on the market today.","This underappreciated transformation is probably the most distinct design change to come to cars over the past half-century, and for most US cars, it happened within just a few years, starting in 1986. You can even pinpoint the exact year curves arrived for some models \u2014 like the Buick LeSabre, which had much harder edges along its hood, roof, and trunk in 1991 (left) than 1992 (right):","In the decades since, cars have just gotten curvier and curvier. Why the big shift?","It turns out it was largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes.","It all started with European luxury designs","By the 1980s, making curved cars wasn't an entirely novel idea \u2014 it had just largely gone out of fashion among US automakers. The streamliners of the 1930s, such as the Chrysler Airflow, had a sleek look designed to minimize wind resistance.","But the Airflow and other streamlined American models were commercial failures, outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Through the 1970s, almost every American-made car had hard, sharp edges, with few curves. They were uniformly designed as a series of three connected boxes: the hood, the cabin, and the trunk.","In Europe, though, fuel was always more expensive, and designers \u2014 especially in Germany \u2014 explored aerodynamic designs much earlier on, says Penny Sparke, author of A Century of Car Design. In the 1960s and '70s, luxury automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz were some of the first to reintroduce curved exteriors.","One of the earliest, most well-known examples is the Porsche 911, which was pretty curvy way back when it was introduced in 1963:","This aesthetic eventually became associated with these luxury cars, both in Europe and in the US, where they arrived as imports. And inevitably, writes historian David Gartman in Auto Opium: A Social History of American Automobile Design, \"American automakers began to copy the European aerodynamic aesthetic in the mid-1980s as a way of courting upscale consumers.\"","Ford, more than any other company, was responsible for bringing this design change to the mass market. Designer Uwe Bahnsen did it first in Europe with the 1982 Ford Sierra, which was far more curved than similar cars of its era:","Reviewers panned the look (nicknaming it the \"jelly mould\"), and the car did not sell well at first. Over time, though, buyers got used it \u2014 especially as other manufacturers eventually copied the style for their own cars.","In the US, Ford designer Jack Telnack \u2014 who'd worked on the company's European design team before taking over North American design in 1980 \u2014 was most directly responsible for the shift to curves. His 1983 Ford Thunderbird design was heavily shaped by wind tunnel testing, prioritizing aerodynamic lines. The look soon filtered down to the mass market with the 1986 Taurus:","It might look unremarkable today, but the design was positively futuristic at the time. The car was even used in the movie RoboCop, which was supposed to take place in the near future. The Taurus, writes Gartman, \"was definitely aiming at the upscale market of young, well-educated buyers to whom the BMW appealed.\"","The strategy worked. The Taurus was a huge hit, with massive sales that saved the struggling company \u2014 and inspired a wave of copycat American cars.","Automakers had to improve fuel economy","Part of the reason the curvy look proliferated so quickly and is still with us today is basic physics. Curved exteriors and more steeply pitched windshields make for less wind resistance, as air can flow more easily over them. This means less gas has to be burned to move the car the same distance at the same speed.","Right as the Taurus premiered, automakers were dealing with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time. Starting in 1978, the average fuel economy of each manufacturer's passenger car fleet sold in the US had to reach higher and higher levels, before plateauing in 1990 at 27.5 miles per gallon.","While automakers had already achieved some gains in efficiency with improved engines and other components, the new curved aesthetic made it much easier and cheaper to achieve further improvements. \"One Ford designer claimed that while it would cost $200 to $300 million to achieve a one-tenth-mile-per-gallon increase by engineering 'under the hood,' aero design achieved a three- to four-tenths m.p.g. increase for almost nothing,\" Gartman writes.","Automakers began relying more heavily on wind tunnels and aerodynamic calculations when designing their cars, and engineers started working more closely with designers. Within just a few years, virtually every car on the market suddenly looked like the once-futuristic Taurus. \"They all looked the same because they were all being shaped in the wind tunnel, and were designed for fuel economy,\" says Larry Edsall, the author of several books on car design history.","Technology made it easier to produce curves","A few key technological developments made these designs possible \u2014 and have since allowed automakers to make their cars curvier and curvier.","For decades, designers had made car models using clay, wood, or other physical materials. During the 1980s, they began using computer models.","\"It's much easier to make these sorts of shapes with computer drawings, rather than wood,\" Sparke says. \"They gave automakers the means to produce those very soft curves.\" Manufacturing technologies also made it easier and cheaper to produce curved shapes in aluminum than before.","As a result, since that initial shift in the 1990s, exteriors have only become curvier. You can get a good sense of how profound the change has been by looking at a newer car thought to be remarkably boxy: the Scion xB.","Sure, it has a big, blocky hatchback. But its edges are still way more rounded than the truly boxy cars of the '80s \u2014 and even the groundbreaking, futuristic 1986 Ford Taurus.","Verge Video: This is the driverless future Mercedes Benz thinks we'll have in the year 2030"],"targetTitle":"Why cars went from boxy in the '80s to curvy in the '90s","targetDescription":"The story behind the most underappreciated design shift in automotive history.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/cdn2.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53521487\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_2.18.56_PM.0.png","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3778782\/1280px-Sierra_3_door_-_an_early_one.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53529619\/_94928968_originalpic.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53525779\/zeldabreath.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn2.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53484121\/medicine1.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3779182\/1280px-2008_Scion_xB.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3778670\/1280px-1934ChryslerAirflow.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53527277\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53525779\/zeldabreath.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3779596\/GettyImages-537571797.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3778714\/1280px-Porsche_911E_ca_1969.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53519805\/shutterstock_554313283.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3778804\/1280px-1st_Ford_Taurus_GL_sedan.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/sNbPdMLpZzB6TfKl0voz4_hJU6A=\/33x0:700x371\/1080x600\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/46514026\/Screen_Shot_2015-06-10_at_5.50.34_PM.0.0.png","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53520017\/625496290.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3779228\/5892655822_2ccb375564_o.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53527277\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3779368\/GettyImages-783770.jpg","https:\/\/cdn2.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53532165\/arnold.0.png","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_asset\/file\/3779340\/GettyImages-103232313.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.vox.com\/2015\/6\/11\/8762373\/car-design-curves","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"better aerodynamics which leads to better fuel economy. duh.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["largely due to three interrelated factors: European style trends, a government-mandated push for fuel economy, and new technologies that allowed manufacturers to more easily design and create curved shapes."],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,20],[4,226]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":197}

The bad news is that it involves women pretending that they are men.","In a column in the Wall Street Journal, John Greathouse of Rincon Venture Partners outlined his belief that women will get more opportunities in tech if they \"create an online presence that obscures their gender.\" Bizarrely equating hiring practices in tech to blind orchestra auditions, Greathouse suggested that women do things like only use their first initial and eliminate photos on both Twitter and LinkedIn. Rather than call on tech companies to overcome the unconscious bias that can too easily be baked into hiring practices, Greathouse thinks women should solve the problem themselves by hiding who they really are.","\"[The column] made me really mad.\" said Angela Dalton , a managing director at Guggenheim. \"It\u2019s wrong on so many levels. It perpetuates the trap that women fall into that if I put my head down and just work, I will get noticed... Success is competency, yes, but it\u2019s also personality and warmth.\"","I sat down with Dalton as well as three other female investors for a panel discussion today at TAP , a tech conference in New York. The topic of our chat was the future of mobile investing, but with the industry abuzz with disbelief about the column, our conversation inevitably changed direction. [Greathouse did not respond to an email I sent him requesting comment. In a tweet, he apologized for the column.]","Heidi Roizen , an operating partner at DFJ, said that when she started in venture capital, she was routinely the only woman in the room. After becoming aware of the gender bias that pervades the tech industry, Roizen decided to give her two children gender-neutral names. That way when their applied to jobs later in life, the recruiter wouldn\u2019t know if they were male or female.","\"This is sad, but it is also true,\" said Roizen. \"Yes we did to change things, but we need to recognize the reality for what it is.\"","Nimi Katragadda , a principal at BoxGroup, agreed with Roizen that you can\u2019t ignore the problem, but said that hiding your identity entirely to overcome bias was \"asinine\u2019 advice.","\"Why should you hide your identity because the person on the other end of the table is backwards?\" she said. \"You are making the problem worse that way.\"","The fact that all the investors on stage for my panel were women was not an accident. In fact, the conference organizers were trying to combat the gender gap in tech by doing the exact opposite of what Greathouse suggested. After having a difficult time recruiting female speakers for last year\u2019s conference -- a problem that plagues most tech events -- the organizers intentionally set out with the goal of having more than 50% female speakers. Highlighting female voices was the conference\u2019s way of signaling to leaders in the room that diversity in leadership roles should be a priority.","\"We know that companies that have diverse teams do better,\" said Susanne Greenfield , a Director at Priceline Group. \"But there is this unconscious bias. People want to hire and promote people who are similar to them. You have to do something to fight that bias.\"","As a LinkedIn editor, I regularly work with thought leaders in tech who share their insights on our publishing platform. Rather than encourage female writers to mask their identity and experiences, I suggest they own it. In order to combat the misguided notion that the tech industry is only comprised of male leaders, women must share their expertise on social networks so that audiences hear a diverse set of perspectives. To get more women interested in pursuing careers in technology, current female leaders must continue to strive to be seen, rather than hide like Greathouse suggests."],"targetTitle":"This 'sad' advice a male VC just gave to women in tech couldn't be more wrong","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/P8f03\/ec47a337d1856ccf914269a1e6aeb01175d51483\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/P8f03\/a8013950eb57ddcde2b6fb016b645dcdd15065be.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/P8f03\/c37694c12704fb5f281fa6b0a45ee986a7d0f702.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/P8f03\/0e2b720788b240c7fcd0cae5ba9c0e4abab43976.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/P8f03","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"The advice is to obscure your gender in your online presence","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["pretending that they are men"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,161],[0,189]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":199}

{"postId":"4w5lgv","postText":["Is It Ethical to Kill Poachers?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Protecting the world\u2019s endangered species from poachers is dangerous business.","Over the past decade, more than 1,000 rangers have died in the line of duty, according to statistics released last week for World Ranger Day. Some deaths were caused by accidents or animals. Most, however, were murders committed by heavily armed poachers who enter national parks and other protected areas in search of species such as tigers, rhinos, and elephants.","At the same time, rangers have killed hundreds of poachers, often spurred by the shoot on sight policies that have become the norm in several parks. The numbers add up: Between 2011 and 2015, rangers at South Africa\u2019s Kruger National Park alone reportedly killed nearly 500 poachers.","While these rangers are undoubtedly heroes who all too often lay down their lives to protect the animals in their care, some organizations have begun to raise questions about the retaliatory bloodshed, asking if it is ethical or moral for rangers to kill suspected poachers without arrest or trial. The issue came to bear most recently last month after a guard in India\u2019s Kaziranga National Park, which has a shoot-to-kill policy, critically wounded a seven-year-old boy from a tribe that lives around the park.","\"We\u2019re pretty horrified by the situation,\" said Sophie Grig, senior campaigner at Survival International, a tribal rights organization that has criticized the recent Kaziranga shooting and shoot-to-kill policies in general. \"It seems to us a very worrying trend that is bad for both local people who get caught in the crossfire and for conservation.\"","Grig also wonders if shooting poachers even solves the larger problem. \"If you were arresting those people and then investigating them, you could trace back and work out who the kingpins are,\" she said. \"If you shoot them dead, you can\u2019t ask them any questions.\"","Annette Hu\u0308bschle, who recently authored a report on rhino poaching for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, echoed those sentiments. She said the \"current militarized approach\" is pushing people away from any chance they might have to participate in conservation. \"There should be a greater focus on investigating the transporters and buyers, prosecuting organized criminals such as kingpins and smugglers, \u2018follow the money\u2019 approaches, and seizing assets of criminals,\" she said.","Aside from legal strategies, the issue of whether or not poachers should be killed brings up several potential lines of ethical thought, said Anna Peterson, a professor in the department of religion at the University of Florida and the author of Being Animal: Beasts and Boundaries in Nature Ethics.","One way of thinking about it, she said, is to ask if individual sentient beings have value and if there is a difference in that value between a human life and that of a rhinoceros. She pointed to ethicist Tom Regan\u2019s test, which asked if you would throw a dog out of a lifeboat to save yourself. \"Essentially, Regan said you would always throw out the dog on the basis of complexity and what would be lost by a human\u2019s death rather than a dog\u2019s death,\" she said.","More broadly, Peterson said, you could ask if a species is rare and significant and if its ecosystem would suffer in its absence. This ecological perspective could come into play when discussing species such as rhinos, tigers, and elephants. \"We have that debate here about Florida panthers, which are both rare and important predators,\" she said.","Finally, Peterson looked at the question from the field of ethics known as war theory. \"The just war theory,\" she said, \"lays out a series of criteria, such as do you have a just cause and have you tried to fix this peacefully?\" If we consider preserving ecosystems to be a just cause, then killing could be justified. Similarly, so could looking at poaching as an economic issue, as it threatens tourism, or as a national security issue, an important consideration involving organized crime, smuggling, national borders, and related crimes such as drugs and weapons.","No one has easy answers. \"Rangers are doing difficult jobs in difficult circumstances,\" Grig said.

{"postId":"804825982809112581","postText":["How AI could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["It\u2019s an experience many shoppers have had: You\u2019re queued in line at the store prepared to make a purchase only to have your credit card declined for no apparent reason. A perfectly legitimate charge has been flagged as fraudulent, and the result is an agitated customer and a retailer with unsold merchandise.","MasterCard has now turned to artificial intelligence to better differentiate between real and mistaken fraud, hoping to tamp down on the former while allowing the latter to go through. It\u2019s the latest financial services company to see the potential for the burgeoning field of machine learning to improve security on its network and enhance the customer experience.","Financial institutions have for years collected data on customers\u2019 habits and routines, and used the information to pinpoint cards that may have been compromised. That\u2019s the reason your card may be declined if you make an unusually large purchase, shop at a store for the first time, or buy gas in a place far from home. The system is essentially deciding whether that behavior seems normal according to predetermined questions, then accepting or declining the purchase based on its decision.","\"The old method was using tests and thresholds and other sorts of rules. With a rules-based approach, you get a tremendous amount of false positives,\" said Todd Marlin, a principal in Ernst & Young\u2019s forensic technology and discovery services practice.","\"What we\u2019re seeing is sort of a gold rush into artificial intelligence,\" Marlin said.","Machine learning can help fraud-detection systems become smarter about what fraud actually looks like, both across the network and on an individual level. For example, the system might detect that you haven\u2019t shopped at a particular merchant in the past, but still accept the purchase because customers with a similar spending history shop there often. Or perhaps you travel to a certain state or country often enough that the system learns purchases there are likely to be legitimate.","Citing a survey from Javelin Advisory Services, MasterCard estimates that $118 billion in sales were declined due to falsely identified fraud in the United States in 2014 \u2014 well more than the $9 billion lost to actual instances of fraud. That\u2019s a large sum of money that retailers \u2014 and credit card purveyors like MasterCard \u2014 could be pocketing.","MasterCard\u2019s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card. The system then combines all of that information to yield a score indicating how likely the transaction is to be fraudulent. Each score builds on the one before it and informs the one after it such that the computer\u2019s algorithm gets better at detecting fraud without a programmer having to engineer every change. The company called it \"the first use of AI being implemented on a global scale directly on the MasterCard network.\"","\"For this to work we need all kinds of data coming in,\" said Ajay Bhalla, the president of enterprise risk and security at MasterCard. \"We\u2019ve been working on a strategy of getting more data points into the network.","\"We see this as a critical component of our future strategy,\" Bhalla added. \"We are embedding AI in everything we\u2019re looking at as a company.\"","For the last decade, Visa has deployed its Visa Advanced Authorization system to detect fraud. The volume of data and the speed at which it\u2019s processed have increased considerably over that time, said Mark Nelsen, the company\u2019s senior vice president of risk products and business intelligence. Visa parses through those large sets of data to discern what characteristics distinguish legitimate and fraudulent spending, and then uses those characteristics to assess the veracity of future purchases.","\"We can look at that transaction and, knowing what we\u2019ve seen in the past, we can predict if this is going to be good or bad,\" Nelsen said.","Digital payment platforms are also embracing machine learning, though fraud remains more difficult to detect in online or mobile commerce. PayPal has developed its own artificial intelligence software to combat fraud, allowing the company to move from a system that can analyze tens of data points to one that can analyze thousands. \"There\u2019s a magnitude of difference \u2014 you\u2019ll be able to analyze a lot more information and identify patterns that are a lot more sophisticated,\" PayPal\u2019s senior director of global risk and data sciences, Hui Wang, told American Banker.","But Visa, MasterCard and PayPal have the financial heft and risk appetite to explore artificial intelligence in ways that smaller and more regional players in the financial services industry do not, said Celent analyst Arin Ray. While most in the industry think AI holds promise, there remain questions about how it will impact regulatory compliance and that makes some hesitant to embrace the technology, according to a report Ray co-authored in August.","\"The concept of AI has been there for 50 years, but it really has had a rebirth of sorts in the last three or four years. The volume of data has grown exponentially in recent times, so there is definitely the need for tools to [analyze it],\" Ray said in an interview.","\"One [concern] is how this technology will impact their existing operations. Since it\u2019s still unproven technology, they don\u2019t want to take that risk if they have to make major changes to their existing infrastructure,\" he said."],"targetTitle":"How artificial intelligence could stop those awkward moments when your credit card is mistakenly declined","targetDescription":"More financial services companies are embracing the technology.","targetKeywords":"mastercard; visa; paypal; credit cards; fraud; credit card fraud; money fraud; credit card decline; artificial intelligence; artificial intelligence banks; financial services; banks; ","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["MasterCard\u2019s new Decision Intelligence software pulls in data, sometimes hundreds of pieces of data, about a specific transaction at the moment a customer swipes his or her credit card.

{"postId":"4ttv4g","postText":["8 things that will be more expensive next month"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["1. Cold-Weather Clothing \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates cold weather clothing expensive In July, the cold-weather months seem far away, but as we get into August and to the back-to-school and holiday season, stores start to put out fall merchandise. This means the prices on items like warm coats, long pants, boots and sweaters will be at their highest during this month. You might find back-to-school sales on some of these items, but you won\u2019t find any deep discounts like you can during other months. A great way to save money on clothing all year is to shop during the off-season. For example, look for discounts on cold-weather clothing during the spring and early summer months, and purchase your summer gear during August and September, according to Consumer Reports. Another tip to shopping in the off-season is to always keep your receipts. The discounts on off-season clothing can increase quickly and dramatically, and stores like Target, Sears and Kmart have price-match policies for anywhere from 14 to 30 days after purchase.","2. Back-to-School Supplies","\u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates back to school supplies expensive Not surprisingly, August is a big month for back-to-school shopping. Sales on school supplies are easy to find, but the prices might not be as low compared to other months. Since retailers know consumers are looking for sales on school supplies during August, it\u2019s not uncommon for them to stock up on lots of shiny new things that are more expensive than your traditional supplies. Shelves will be stocked with inexpensive \"loss leaders,\" like pencils and paper to get you in the door. But retailers count on you to also purchase full-priced items with high profit margins \u2014 like binders, graph paper and computer memory sticks, according to Time.com. It\u2019s an exciting time for kids, and it\u2019s easy to get tempted into buying all the new things. Consider keeping a stock of basic and inexpensive school supplies, like paper, pens, pencils and binders to get you through the first few weeks of school. Wait to buy the rest of your school supplies in September, which is typically the best month to score rock-bottom prices on this stuff.","3. Theme Park Tickets \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates theme park tickets expensive The summer season is an ideal time for a family to The summer season is an ideal time for a family to head to a popular theme park , but ticket prices are at their highest during these months. Typically, theme parks are the most crowded when kids are out of school, through late August, during the week of Thanksgiving, over the winter holidays and during spring break season. Because the demand is so high, these businesses charge the most they can for entrance to the park, according to Nasdaq.com. Not only does this put a major dent in your wallet, but it can also increase how much time you have to wait to go on a ride. So you\u2019re paying top-dollar to visit the park, but getting less value because you have to spend so much time waiting to see the attractions. Dave Shute, co-author of \"The Easy Guide to Your First Walt Disney World Visit\" recommended vising Disney World between the second week of Easter and the week before Memorial day, mid-to-late October, any week in November other than Thanksgiving, and during December up to a week before Christmas.","4. Patio Furniture \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates patio furniture expensive The last full month of summer might seem like a good time to buy new patio furniture, but retailers usually wait until September to really drop prices on these goods, according to DealNews. August is still a warm month, and customers will pay full price to lounge outdoors and soak up the sun. Since you can easily spend $400 to $2,000 or more on an outdoor furniture set, according to HowMuchIsIt.org, it\u2019s smart to wait until then, as retailers will be trying to quickly sell off the remaining goods. Keep in mind that popular stores like Sears and Home Depot might sell out of discounted outdoor furniture more quickly than a small retailer, so keep your eye out for deals starting at the end of August, according to personal finance advice website SmartAsset. But if you buy before Labor Day, you\u2019ll likely pay more than you would later, according to CBS News.","5. Televisions \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates televisions expensive Deals on televisions are usually scarce during the summer months, and prices are still high on HDTVs in August. Prices do start to drop in the fall, as the summer comes to a close and the holiday season starts to ramp up. If you need to purchase a new TV before the prime season, DealNews recommended looking for a name-brand 55-inch TV or larger for around $500, although you might be able to save around $100 by going for an off-brand. Also, college students who want to upgrade the TVs or LCDs in their rooms should wait until school has been in session for at least a few weeks to score better prices.","6. iPhones and iPads \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates iphones ipads expensive August is a terrible time to August is a terrible time to upgrade your Apple devices because the company usually unveils their upcoming models in September or October, reported DealNews. This means the price on an Apple device purchased in August will immediately begin to lose value in the coming weeks and months. If you\u2019re in the market for a new iPhone or iPad, either purchase it earlier in the summer or wait for deals on older models in the fall.","7. Bicycles \u00a9 Provided by Gobankingrates bicycles expensive August is plenty warm enough to still enjoy outdoor cycling, so it\u2019s typically a bad month to invest in a new bicycle. If you can wait, prices start to drop closer to the fall, with discounts starting in August and lasting through December, according to Consumer Reports. Just like car dealerships, bike shops need to make room for the new inventory toward the end of the year. So the best time to look for a rock-bottom deal is during the winter months, according to Bicycling.com. The site also recommended avoiding models that are more than a few years old, even if they are deeply discounted. Advances in cycling technology change so quickly that a \"great deal\" might actually just be an average one if you can get a far superior model for just a little bit more money."],"targetTitle":"8

{"postId":"4yjpbz","postText":["Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you\u2019d still be making about the same \u2014 a bit more than $22 per hour.","Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour. Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.)","Notice that I said \"men.\" Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall.","The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don\u2019t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.","Other measures of women\u2019s progress in the workforce \u2014 their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies \u2014 show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call \"five decades of remarkable but slowing change\" for American women.","Bailey and DiPrete\u2019s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have \u2014 and haven\u2019t \u2014 made over the past half-century. It isn\u2019t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality \u2014 explicit discrimination on pay, overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure.","Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn\u2019t occurred. But that premium itself isn\u2019t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average).","Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men \u2014 especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men \u2014 are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference \u2014 affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so \u2014 but they can only go so far.","The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by \"pre-market\" factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men \u2014 there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates \u2014 yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of \"occupational desegregation\" \u2014 women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa \u2014 has slowed.","There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn\u2019t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the \"motherhood penalty\" \u2014 the relative decline in wages for women when they have children \u2014 has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too \u2014 something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal.","Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off.","The Olympic tax","Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress.","But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error.","The Fed","Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed\u2019s meeting hasn\u2019t resolved the question.","The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May\u2019s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending \u2014 a key pillar of strength in recent months \u2014 is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed\u2019s task in two ways: Policymakers don\u2019t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates.","Number of the week","Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn\u2019t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers."],"targetTitle":"Why Women Are No Longer Catching Up To Men On Pay","targetDescription":"This is In Real Terms, a column analyzing the week in economic news.

She argues that Latinos and other immigrant groups, particularly Asians, are so liberal on issues including Obamacare, gun control and the role of government that they\u2019ll never vote in large numbers for Republicans.","Coulter refuses to acknowledge public opinion on the immigration issue, writing: \"The only ones opposed to our current immigration policies are the people.\" In fact, polls routinely show that a majority of Americans support immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented -- a more liberal stance than the one released this week by House Republicans, which would only create a pathway to legal residence.","To back her assertions, Coulter cites a study by Phyllis Schlafly, a fellow conservative pundit who has called on the Republicans to keep their party as white as possible.","Coulter violated the embargo on the study, writing that it was \"too important to wait.\" The study was not provided in the column, so it\u2019s not clear what new information it contained. Coulter writes that the study brings together several different previously released surveys by Pew, Gallup, Latino Decisions, and other pollsters showing that immigrants and Latinos tend to lean more liberal than the average U.S. citizen.","\"The people that Republicans ought to reach out to are white voters,\" Schlaflly said last year during an appearance on conservative radio show Focus Today. \"There is not any evidence at all that these Hispanics coming in from Mexico will vote Republican.","Actually, there is. Former President George W. Bush pulled 44 percent of the Latino vote in 2004. Avoiding the approach advocated by folks like Coulter or Schlafly, he spoke some Spanish, supported immigration reform and refrained from ranting against Latinos during interviews with the media.","Many observers have concluded that the Republican Party would perform better among Latinos if it moderated the intransigent stance on immigration adopted by hardliners like Coulter.

The men were demanding cab fare for the ride Loftis had just received.","\"I\u2019ll get your money,\" he told them, according to his own account given to police and recorded in an arrest warrant soon after.","Instead, the warrant said, Loftis retrieved a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, returned to the living room and fired off eight shots, striking both men.","He then went to get gas, cleaned his home with bleach and burned the two bodies, along with his clothes and towels, in the back yard, according to the document.","On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, On Monday, his lawyer argued that Loftis acted in self-defense and buried and burned the bodies in a state of panic, according to the Post and Courier . A prosecutor said the prosecution was moving forward in its case against Loftis.","Nonetheless, a judge in the case granted bail to the 39-year-old, who faces murder charges for fatally shooting the cab driver, 46-year-old Guma Oz Dubar, and the other man, 32-year-old James Cody Newland.","\"He\u2019s a human being,\" defense attorney Stephen Harris said, according to the Post and Courier. \"He freaked out and thought he was going to prison, so he tried to hide the bodies. Nobody knows how you\u2019re going to react when you kill two people.\"","Harris said what Loftis did after the shooting was \"heinous,\" according to the Post and Courier.","Berkeley County Deputy Solicitor Bryan Alfaro said the prosecution would continue pursuing the case, given Loftis\u2019s inconsistent accounts of whether the men forced their way into the home or whether he let them in \u2014 a crucial part of his defense, according to the Post and Courier, because of South Carolina\u2019s \"stand your ground\" law, which grants protection to homeowners who use deadly force against intruders.","Stand-your-ground laws have sparked national debate, especially in the years following the 2012 shooting death of an unarmed African American teenager in Florida. An attorney for George Zimmerman did not invoke it as part of his legal defense, although a member of the jury later told CNN that they had weighed Florida\u2019s stand-your-ground law before finding Zimmerman not guilty in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin.","Gun rights advocates say such laws codify the right to protect one\u2019s home, while opponents say they legalize the sometimes-deadly use of force.","On Monday, Alfaro, the deputy solicitor, depicted Loftis\u2019s actions in gruesome detail.","\"They were essentially just slow-cooked inside the grave site,\" he said.","Following the brutal events that early-March morning, Loftis did not call police.

So here is an at-a-glance look at what President Trump's executive order means.","Is this a step towards banning abortion in the US?","Not in itself. This particular executive order is relevant outside of US borders.","The policy requires non-governmental organisations receiving federal funding to agree to \"neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations\".","This particularly worries women's rights campaigners in developing countries, where funds or facilities are already limited.","Although this policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home.","His signing of this order as one of his first executive actions indicates he still sees the issue as a priority.","Is President Trump the first to introduce a ban on foreign funding?","Republicans and Democrats have been involved in a political tug-of-war over the issue for decades.","Republican President Ronald Reagan first created the Mexico City Policy in 1984, stopping funding for international groups which perform or provide information on abortions.","But Democrats later rescinded it under the Clinton administration.","It was reinstated when President George W Bush took over in 2001 and overturned again by President Barack Obama in 2009. And now it is back.","What has all this got to do with Mexico City?","The order's official name is the Mexico City Policy because President Reagan first implemented it at a United Nations population conference in Mexico City.","And why is it sometimes nicknamed the 'global gag law'?","Critics of the policy say organisations working around the world feel censored by it because they cannot offer women full advice on family planning.","If they flout the rules, they lose funding which, in some cases, could threaten certain projects or the whole organisation.","However, pro-life groups have welcomed the new administration's swift move.","\"President Trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of US pro-life organisation Susan Anthony List.","Is it unusual to have so many men at the table?","No. Like many governmental decisions, the rules on abortion are often determined by male officials.","Many on social media were quick to point out that the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling - seen as a landmark case for abortion rights in the US - was delivered by an all-male Supreme Court.","The Roe v Wade decision says abortion is legal until a foetus is viable, typically between 22 and 24 weeks.","What are Mr Trump's views on abortion?","The new US president has previously changed his mind on the issue. He has gone from being pro-choice in 1999 to being against abortion today, although he says he would allow exceptions such as in the case of rape or incest.","On the presidential campaign trail, he said he believed \"some form of punishment\" should be in place for women who have abortions, if the practice is banned.","But, after strong criticism, he released a statement saying that only the doctor or practitioner should be punished, not the woman.","In an interview with CBS News, Mr Trump said: \"The laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.\"","He refused to say whether he believed abortion was murder, but he later conceded that he could not disagree with the statement."],"targetTitle":"Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean?","targetDescription":"A look at why a photo of Mr Trump and a group of men making an abortion ruling has gone viral.","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["The photograph in question was taken on US President Donald Trump's first day in the Oval Office on Monday, when he signed a ban on federal money going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,0],[1,224]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":215}

Got something on your mind? Email the Funbag. Today, we\u2019re covering egg whites, sex, cats that do dishes, and more.","I took my family on a short road trip for spring break, and on the way home, my 2-year-old asked me to pull over so he could go take a crap. So I did. I pulled into the gas station, and then my wife brought the kid to the bathroom, and he announced that he was bluffing. He did NOT have to take a shit. So he got back in the car, and we drove for another 30 minutes, and then he announced, for a second time, that he had to go poop.","\"You\u2019re not lying this time, are you?\" I asked him. \"If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll never stop for you to poop again.\"","But he said he had really had to go, so I pull over, and it\u2019s the same thing. He was either lying or he got stage fright in the McDonald\u2019s can. So my wife puts him back in the car, and we get stuck in traffic on the Beltway just as we\u2019re getting home.","I think you know where this is going. Once again, the boy screamed out that he had to poop. I told him he could hold it until we got home. Then he started clutching at his tummy and crying out to pull over.","\"I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying this time,\" my wife said. But I swear to you, we were just a mile from home at that point. And the Beltway is one of those horrible roads that offers very little in the way of ideal places to pull over. Home was the only logical destination for him to go void his bowels. So I told him he had to hold on jussssst a minute longer. Begged him, really.","Sponsored","On the exit ramp, he suddenly stopped crying. And I knew why. I could hear him exhaling forcefully. Kids don\u2019t hide that sort of thing. We pulled into the driveway (not before hitting every light on the way there), and my wife rushed the boy into the house and into the bathroom. Green shit was CAKED on his legs. It was everywhere. Some of it fell out of his pants (how?) and landed on the front stoop. It was terrifying. Anyway, that\u2019s parenting in a nutshell for you. You take every precaution possible, and you still end up with green shit all over the place.","Now, your letters:","Dan:","I don\u2019t know if this is a good question, because I doubt there\u2019s any kind of satisfying answer to it. But why do no NFL teams seem to care that Jameis Winston maybe raped a girl? The mock drafts all have him going at no. 1 or 2 (most say no. 1). How the fuck?! Especially in light of the year the NFL has just had (and Goodell\u2019s publicity push for an end to violence towards women), would it be that crazy to suggest that NFL teams won\u2019t want to risk spending their first-round pick on someone who many people believe has a capacity for actual evil? Even if he never raped anyone, he has shown he\u2019s a liability, at best, with the crab-legs thing and the \"fuck her right in the pussy\" thing. How are Bucky Brooks and Daniel Jeremiah not even hedging their bets at this stage? I\u2019m sure last year they talked ad fucking nauseum about Johnny Manziel\u2019s partying and how that would affect his draft stock. HOW DOES RAPE NOT??? Why aren\u2019t they even mentioning it?","I think you\u2019re wildly overgeneralizing to say teams don\u2019t care. Of course they care. You\u2019d care if you were the GM who decided to risk his job by investing the no. 1 pick in a seafood thief and alleged rapist. But the Bucs desperately need a QB (or else everyone gets fired anyway), so they\u2019re probably best off drafting Winston and then throwing out a bunch of some bullshit spiel to Peter King about how they had private eyes talk to over 75 people about Winston in studying him for the draft. That strikes me as an obvious ass-covering move so they can draft Winston, and then, if he fucks up, they can be like, \"Don\u2019t blame us! We talked to 75 whole people about him!\" They just want to make sure he doesn\u2019t commit any FUTURE rapes. And if he does, they want to make sure that they can blame Winston and Winston alone for it.","But it is strange that, in the public scouting process, Winston\u2019s past has been reduced to a handful of convenient euphemisms like \"immaturity\" and shit like that. Look at Lovie Smith gush about Winston, even though he can\u2019t possibly know him all that well:","\"To me, I think he\u2019s told us an awful lot with how he\u2019s handled it,\" Smith said. \"It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting ready to go into the NFL and scrutiny is coming his way. He\u2019s gone through it a couple years now, and he\u2019s answered the bell. That\u2019s what you have to do. You have to have tunnel vision and do your job. Looking from the outside, that\u2019s what he\u2019s been able to do.\"","I mean, that\u2019s a hell of a way to twist a rape allegation into a positive. LOOK AT HIM SHAKE OFF DEFENDERS AND CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES WITH SUCH EASE! The fact that Winston was never formally charged with rape, and the fact that the NFL and their broadcast partners probably have a great many lawyers who would prefer that the word RAPE not be thrown around when addressing Winston, is all Smith needs to sell you on the IDEA of drafting him ... to concoct a narrative of an ambitious young man looking to redeem himself as a way of cleverly masking the fact that the Bucs have an urgent, raw football need to fill, and they have little choice but to fill it with a guy who might be the scum of the fucking Earth.","That\u2019s why Winston\u2019s rape allegations haven\u2019t necessarily affected his draft stock the way Johnny Manziel\u2019s drinking did. It\u2019s because NFL teams think that Winston is simply a better player. If neither player had baggage going into the draft, Winston would be taken before Manziel every time. That\u2019s the reason the Browns are ready to give up on Manziel already. It\u2019s not the boozing. It\u2019s the fact that they don\u2019t think the little fucker can play. The NFL can chirp all they like about domestic violence and doing the right thing, but the bottom line is that the majority of their employees must win in order to keep their jobs, and that means they must place a bloodless premium on talent than the NFL would rather not acknowledge as still existing. They constantly want to sell you on character or on potential character instead. If Jameis is gonna go no. 1 no matter what, the NFL has no choice but to hold their noses and make it look like they didn\u2019t willingly crown a psychopath prince of the draft.","You know what\u2019s funny about all this? Winston was AWFUL last season, and I\u2019m not talking about just his \"Yakety Sax\" play in the Rose Bowl. He threw 18 picks last season against horrible, piddly-shit ACC teams. But scouts, for some reason, seem to be far more impressed by the fact that Winston staged a number of winning comebacks that were necessitated almost exclusively because of his own boneheaded mistakes. If you look the part, and you\u2019ve got the arm, and you have that subjective mix of football IQ and magical QB unicorn leadership skills, scouts will happily overlook all those turnovers. And the rape stuff. It\u2019s quite something.","(By the way, SUPERFUCK Jaws and Mike Mayock for their little \"Mariota\u2019s on top of my board now!\" spiel this week. Jaws is an empty-headed attention whore who will say basically anything. And the only reason certain football fans enjoy Mayock is because they haven\u2019t learned to be sick of him yet.)","Kyle:","Are BIG EGG and BIG NUTRITION teaming up to push the egg white agenda? You have to have roughly double the egg whites to get the same amount of food, thus causing an increase in egg consumption. I\u2019m suspicious of the whole thing.","But the yolk has all the cholesterol! If you simply throw out the yolk, and then add bacon, ham, and cheese to your omelet, it can\u2019t hurt you at all! That\u2019s science.","I used to be huge on egg whites. True story: In college, I would go to the dining hall, toast a bagel, grab a couple of hard-boiled eggs, remove the yolks, and then mush the whites onto the bagel and eat a sad egg-white bagel sandwich that way. I thought this was a healthy lunch, conveniently ignoring the whole \"eating a whole bagel\" part of the enterprise. Sometimes I ate two in one sitting. Do not do this.","The truth is that egg whites are one of those foods you eat so that you can eat more food. I hate small portions, so if I eat a 12-pound egg-white omelet, I feel like I just got away with something. But in general, this is untrue. You need portion control in your life, which means you should just splurge and eat the goddamn yolk anyway. The yolk is the best part. All golden and runny and seeping into the toast nooks ... I could a 50-egg omelet. I swear. There are never enough eggs in the omelet for me. Why are eggs so small? I need eggs to be triple their current size. I don\u2019t like cracking so many of them. I am not a crackpot.","Danny:","If tomorrow, you could appoint any current non-politician in America as the POTUS for the next eight years, who do you think would do the best job? Give me your top 3, and provide reasons why. It has to be a public figure\u2014don\u2019t get all sappy and say your dad, or your awesome 2nd-grade teacher. Also, assume that anyone who you appointed would drop whatever else it was they were doing and accept their next eight years living in the White House.","Well, look, it\u2019s not like politicians are somehow uniquely skilled anyway. Pretty much anyone can be a politician if some shadowy party operative hands them a bag of cash and is like, \"Bill Kristol says you have nice teeth.\" That\u2019s truly all you need to become a prominent politician in America at the present moment. They should probably make you take a test or something.","That said, if I had to vote for one random famous person to be dropped into the Oval Office for the next eight years, I\u2019m picking Elon Musk. I need a VISIONARY, man. I want Musk to divert all defense spending into building a giant water slide from New York to L.A. Every other issue facing the country would be solved if such a water slide existed. Don\u2019t tell me it can\u2019t be done. I won\u2019t hear it.","I know it\u2019s lame to pick a captain of industry for that job, but I don\u2019t want a fucking actor. I don\u2019t want some comedian like Jon Stewart or Louis CK who would hate the job instantly. A good president needs to believe his own horseshit, and Musk and\/or Tim Cook would more than fulfill that requirement.","Third choice would be Belichick, because he\u2019d fire everyone and then fuck every Congressman\u2019s wife. And he\u2019d have SO many secrets. Finally, America would have a Putin of its own. SUCK IT, RUSSIA.","Brian:","Me and my girlfriend have debated this for a while, and we are both dead set in believing the other is 100 percent wrong: What\u2019s the better time of year for sex, summer or winter? She says that summer is better because the heat makes it feel that much more steamy, summer bodies are great, and you can get fully nude without having to keep any layers on because of the cold. I say fuck that.","September is the most common birth month in the United States, which means that we Americans seem to prefer fucking in the winter, if only because there\u2019s nothing else to do. Personally, I prefer summer. I don\u2019t want to worry about having to cover up all the sexy business with a comforter because everyone in the bed is colder than shit in January. I want everything out in the open. I want to be hot and sweaty and horny and dying to rip off my sexy striped polo shirt just for YOU, baby. I want the covers off and the lights on and I want to see EVERYTHING. I need good material for when I\u2019m alone. Summer is sexier. TELL THEM, Y&T!","HALFTIME!","William:","Would you rather have a dog that folds laundry, or a cat that does dishes?","The dog, I guess. My preference for dogs over cats is greater than my hatred for doing dishes over folding laundry, so there you have it. Doing dishes blows, but folding laundry is also horrible. It\u2019s 8:30 p.m., and the kids are finally asleep ,and I\u2019m just about ready to settle into the recliner when I see that fucking laundry basket filled to the brim over in the corner, and it never ceases to make my blood boil. Fuck that laundry. I should only have to fold MY clothes. My clothes are big and sparse and easy to fold. My laundry is awesome. My wife should thank me for never wearing more than one pair of pants in a week.","Corey:","Let\u2019s say all members of the Beatles and N.W.A are magically revived and\/or returned to their artistic primes. The Beatles then have to go into the studio and record an album of N.W.A\u2019s best hits, and vice versa. Which album ends up sounding better?","The Beatles one, because the Beatles would just take the NWA lyrics and arrange some entirely new Beatles song around them, and it would probably be very pretty. As much as I like NWA, I don\u2019t wanna hear them butcher \"Blackbird.\" None of those guys could sing. When Diddy ripped off \"Every Breath You Take\" just so he could milk Biggie\u2019s death one more time, I wanted him to fall into a canyon.","Also, I bet John Lennon would REALLY relish pretending to be an inner-city black man. He\u2019d be way too enthusiastic about it.","Blake:","How many albums a year could the top pop stars put out? Beyonce\u0301 could have the top 20 songwriters writing at all times, and the top producers and editors working year-round like Christmas elves. The masses never tire of pop music, so why not put out an album a month?","Because that\u2019s too much product! Even the nuttiest white-girl Beyonce\u0301 fans would get sick of her if she put out 120 songs a year. You can\u2019t keep up with that kind of catalog. Those songs can\u2019t all be great. Even if they were, you\u2019d still grade them on a curve and have certain \"hits\" in your mind that would make your permanent rotation, with everything else falling by the wayside. That\u2019s easy to do now. Back in day, when I had to listen to tapes, I usually listened to all the songs on the album because I was too lazy to fast forward. I heard \"Back Off Bitch\" by GNR far more times than anyone should have to endure. Not their best work. I don\u2019t have to do that anymore. Technology has made me a supremely lazy music fan.","It\u2019s just not possible to absorb that much music from one artist, no matter how hard you try. Ever have your favorite artist put out a double album? It\u2019s a complete pain in the ass. I need you to go away for a while so that I can grow to love you again. Whenever an artist says that they had 60 tracks to choose from or whatever for a single album, I can promise you that you NEVER want to hear the 50 tracks they threw away. Half of those tracks are just the guy freestyling on the bongos while high on acid.","Kevin:","So I\u2019m getting married in a month, and my fiance\u0301 and I are closing on a house next week. Instead of some over-the-top bachelor party, I am asking that my friends just help me move. My friends feel that this is selfish, and I\u2019m taking advantage of them. We\u2019re moving from a 1,000-square-foot apartment into a three-bedroom house. It\u2019s not like we have a ton of stuff. The plan was that I rent the truck, and we move everything Saturday morning, and then grill steaks and get drunk Saturday night in the new house. I think that this is way better than asking everyone to kick in hundreds of dollars to go golfing for a weekend or whatever; it\u2019s my bachelor party, and I should be able to do what I want, right?","But that\u2019s not a party. You\u2019re asking for free manual labor instead. That doesn\u2019t count as a celebration, you monster. If I threw a party, and everyone came, and then I was like, \"Hey guys, this is a LAUNDRY FOLDING party! Now fold my laundry and I\u2019ll get takeout!\" all my friends would have me killed. You can\u2019t do that. If you want to ask your friends to help you move, that\u2019s fine. But you can\u2019t apply that to your party credit. Do the move yourself, and then have the bachelor-party cookout afterward, without putting any work obligations on your friends.","Steve:","This actually happened close to six years ago, but it remains a contentious issue amongst our group of friends. Five of us were on a road trip from Montreal to Boston, rotating drivers evenly as one does on longish road trips. As we got close to Boston, the friend driving the last leg got pulled over for speeding. Since we were in college at the time, the $200+ ticket was nothing to sneeze at. (Who are we kidding? It\u2019s still a lot of damn money.) The issue was \u2014 does the ticket get split amongst the group, or paid solely by the driver? The four of us who drove first say no, since we drove our portion without incident. The friend who got slapped with the bill argues that since the last leg was the toughest, and we were trying to get to our destination by a certain time, and nobody complained about his speed until the blue and whites started flashing, that we should split the ticket. Who is right?","The last leg was the toughest? Why? Were there dragons lining the highway? Your friend was driving, and thus he\u2019s responsible for his own driving behavior, even if he had shit luck. He pays the ticket. If another friend riding in the car wants to pitch in, fine. But that guy shouldn\u2019t EXPECT it. These kids today never want to take responsibility SMDH!","I went to a basketball game last week, and I had an Uber take me home, only the Uber guy got a parking ticket outside the arena while he was waiting for me. And I felt bad that he got the ticket, so when the ride ended, I gave him $20 in cash extra. And that, of course, made me feel all generous and kind. YES AMERICA, I helped pay a full one-tenth of that poor bastard\u2019s ticket while exploiting regulation loopholes that force working-class people to act as private chauffeurs to uppity white dipshits with smartphones. MEDAL OF HONOR FOR ME, PLEEEEEEEZ.","But screw your friend.","Tom:","Where would the most opportune time\/place for aliens to land to get the biggest initial audience, but not get shot out of the sky? The White House lawn would be a great spot, but they would have several fighter jets shooting at them before they land; a random field would have no one around. I feel the best bet is a major sporting event that doesn\u2019t have dedicated aerial security. What do you think?","All major sporting events have (in theory) patrolled airspace. I would just vote for the Sheep Meadow in Central Park, dead center of Manhattan. News crews could get there quickly. Crowds would form. Roasted-nut vendors would make a KILLING. And New Yorkers would instantly try to take ownership of the First Contact experience. \"You guys don\u2019t get these aliens. IT\u2019S A NEW YORK THING.\"","Actually, now that I think about it, let\u2019s choose any large park space in any other city. Because Central Park is a complete fucking pain in the ass. It\u2019s hot and overcrowded, and there\u2019s horseshit everywhere. If aliens landed there, four million people would converge on the spot, and then I wouldn\u2019t be able to get a good view, and the subways would be jammed, and I would just say FUCK IT and then go home and watch the aliens on TV instead.","Mike:","How does Robocop poop? He has that weird baby food he has to eat to keep his organic parts alive, so he must have to release it somehow.","Actually, if you look at the original uniform design, the posterior covering is soft and potentially removable. It\u2019s not welded metal. Robocop could, in theory, remove a posterior assflap to do his business, even if no standard toilet could possibly bear the weight of a three-ton cyborg sitting down to shit in it. My guess is that instead of straight defecation, Robocop has an internal waste-management system that processes his urine and stool, and then either a) recycles it for some other practical use (poop gun), or b) can be discreetly disposed of, like through a leg dispenser. That\u2019s what I would do if I were designing the perfect 21st-century scumbag-killing machine. RoboCop has no time for poop.","Aaron:","What happened if it came out that President Obama had a Twitter account under a different name and was trolling conservatives and his critics completely anonymously? I\u2019m not saying one of his staffers was doing this\u2014this was how Barry O passed the time while on the shitter. Would there be calls for impeachment\/resignation? How long would the media blow that up for? What would his Twitter handle be? Would he put a picture and bio, or just keep the egg there like a weirdo?","There are calls for Obama\u2019s impeachment and resignation on a daily basis right now, so I assume a @Luther account would only amplify those daily complaints. \"More like Marco Boob-io, AMIRITE?!\" That tweet would probably help fill up a news cycle or two before everyone stopped giving a shit. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d actually resign, though. After all, plenty of politicians out there already use Twitter for trolling purposes. And we live in age where you can survive pretty much any scandal so long as you\u2019re willing to sit there and ride it out. You let 200 million people take a dump on your face for a week, nod politely, and then everything is back to normal.","I do think he\u2019d have a picture and bio for his troll account, tho. The Obama machine knows too much about the internet to let that slide.","Email of the week!","Ape Chemist:","Suppose during the first round of the NFL draft, the camera cuts to a player talking on his cell phone and smiling and celebrating with his family and friends. This all takes place while the team is on the clock, so Goodell has yet to announce the pick. While celebrating, the player\u2014like Lamarr Houston or Bill Gramatica\u2014tears his ACL. Assume the team hasn\u2019t officially announced the pick. Does the NFL let the team withdraw the pick? I remember when the Vikings had to pass on a pick because they didn\u2019t get their card in on time, so I could absolutely see some team arguing the pick wasn\u2019t official until the card is turned in and read. I hope this happens to some team like the Cowboys, and Jerry sends someone onstage to tackle Goodell before he reaches the podium.","I might be wrong, but I think once you turn the card in, the pick is final. No backsies, even if it hasn\u2019t been formally announced. If you haven\u2019t turned the card in but GLORY BOY decided to tear his knee up anyway, then fuck him.

While he doesn\u2019t foresee the chatbot replacing teaching assistants or professors, he expects the chatbot\u2019s question-answering abilities to be an invaluable asset for massive online open courses, where students often drop out and generally don\u2019t receive the chance to engage with a human instructor. With more human-like interaction, Goel expects online learning could become more appealing to students and lead to better educational outcomes.","\"To me this is a grand challenge,\" Goel said. \"Education is such a huge priority for the entire human race.\"","At the start of this semester Goel provided his students with a list of nine teaching assistants, including Jill, the automated question and answering service Goel developed with the help of some of his students and IBM.","Goel and his teaching assistants receive more than 10,000 questions a semester from students on the course\u2019s online forum. Sometimes the same questions are asked again and again. Last spring he began to wonder if he could automate the burden of answering so many repetitive questions.","As Goel looked for a technology that could help, he settled on IBM Watson, which he had used for several other projects. Watson, an artificial intelligence system, was designed to answer questions, so it seemed like a strong fit.","To train the system to answer questions correctly, Goel fed it forum posts from the class\u2019s previous semesters. This gave Jill an extensive background in common questions and how they should be answered.","Goel tested the system privately for months, having his teaching assistants examine whether Jill\u2019s answers were correct. Initially the system struggled with similar questions such as \"Where can I find assignment two?\" and \"When is assignment two due?\" Goel tweaked the software, adding more layers of decision-making to it. Eventually Jill reached the point where its answers were good enough.","\"I cannot create chaos in my classroom. Jill had to be almost perfect as a human TA or I am,\" Goel said.","The system is only allowed to answer questions if it calculates that it is 97 percent or more confident in its answer. Goel found that was the threshold at which he could guarantee the system was accurate.","There are many questions Jill can\u2019t handle. Those questions were reserved for human teaching assistants.","Goel plans to use Jill again in a class this fall, but will likely change its name so students have the challenge of guessing which teaching assistant isn\u2019t human."],"targetTitle":"What happened when a professor built a chatbot to be his teaching assistant","targetDescription":"These students were shocked to find out they'd

There are a lot of smartphones ranging from flagship to entry-level segment to come with the metal body.","We are speaking about only the metal bodied smartphones. But why? Because the metal body smartphones usually have stripes on their back. We don't say all of them have the stripes over the back, but most of the smartphones have that and the other metal body smartphone have this stripes along their sides.","You might be wondering on what does these stripes indicate, right? Well, look after the sliders below to know more the white lines.","What Actually Are Those White Lines?","The answer to this question is a simple one. The White Lines on all metal bodied smartphones are 'Antenna Bands'. Antenna Bands are the things usually the antenna in radios or other electronic devices which convert the electric power signals to radio signals and vice versa. This is bit technical. In simple words, the antenna bands are used to receive and transmit signals.","Who Started This?","Previously, there used to some other design policy where the antenna bands are not visible, however, it is worth noticing that the old age smartphones didn't use metal to build on. Instead, there are iPhones with glass on front and back.","Now, this White lines trend was started by Apple with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Soon, it was followed by other manufacturers. It is worth noticing that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were heavily criticised for their design language.","Are they harmful?","Absolutely, No. They are just antenna bands to send and receive signals. According to us, manufacturers designed in that manner to make the smartphone look better.","Followed by?","Apple always leads from the front in innovating and they are the same with this. Following the footprints of Apple, there are many manufacturers such as OnePlus, HTC, Meizu, etc who added the same design language to their smartphones. However, some of them look really good such as the OnePlus 3, Meizu MX6.","Asus Manufactured the Invisible Band Smartphone","Asus is the first manufacturer who launched a metal smartphone with invisible bands.

This one would fill your living room and uses robotics and artificial intelligence.","Ripcord, a startup backed with a $9.5 million funding round led by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, has created a machine its founders think is key to solving a huge problem faced by companies as they try to access data that hasn\u2019t made it into the information age \u2013 billions of boxes of paper files.","``We\u2019re drowning in problem,\u2019\u2019 said co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Alex Fielding. ``The issue is not demand.\u2019\u2019","Like many Silicon Valley start ups, Ripcord believes its technology is the answer to a prosaic problem. While the internet has been around for more than 20 years, the amount of printing done by companies is still increasing. All of those forms, invoices, reports and receipts typically end up in boxes in warehouses, where the data sit and are either useless or require a lot of time and money to access.","Ripcord\u2019s machine aims to take away much of the labor of turning that paper into usable electronic information. The first problem most people face when they\u2019re armed with a computer and even the fastest desk-top scanner is how paper files are attached to each other. The company reckons that it takes the average person six to eight hours to scan a box of papers. Much of the time goes to removing staples and other fasteners that cause the dreaded paper jams. A chunk more time is wasted on the categorization and naming of files in the computer.","With billions of boxes of files in storage across the U.S. alone, that\u2019s a lot of hours of work and paper cuts. Ripcord\u2019s machine takes stacks of paper, pulls out any staples and loads them one sheet at a time onto a conveyor belt for rapid scanning, up to one sheet a second. That seemingly inane task is done at breakneck speed by a combination of industrial robot and sensors all powered by artificial intelligence software.","Ripcord isn\u2019t just processing paper and putting it into boxes. It\u2019s offering a service where it charges as little as 0.4 cents a sheet per month for scanning and uploading to the cloud in formats that its customers can access and integrate into other commonly used corporate computer systems. It also stores the information for them. The goal: all that paper comes out of the machine and goes into the shredder for recycling. Warehousing paper information is a $25 billion annual market, according to Hayward, California-based Ripcord.","The machines aren\u2019t going on sale. Ripcord is aiming to deploy hundreds of the giant devices in warehouses where hoppers of paper will be moved around by robots. Fielding is keen to point out that his automated system isn\u2019t putting people out of work, it\u2019s going to change the way that filing work is done. The machines still need human input in preparing files and supervision of the speedy process, even though it has built-in error correction and will even divert through a trap door multiple sheets or paper with sticky notes attached.","\"We\u2019re not replacing people with machines, we\u2019re giving them much more interesting things to do,\" Fielding said. \"I don't think anyone went to college to become a human staple remover.\""],"targetTitle":"Ripcord Removes the Pain of Paper Cuts With Robot Digital Filers","targetDescription":"Companies are still `drowning' in files that haven't been converted to digital records, CEO says.","targetKeywords":"technology","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["Ripcord"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,0],[1,7]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":233}

Unless urgent action is taken, drug resistant infections will kill 10 million people a year by 2050, more than cancer kills currently, the report\u2019s authors warn.","Drug resistant infections are thought to be growing due to over-use of medicine such as antibiotics and anti-fungus treatments to treat minor conditions such as the common cold. With over-use, resistance to the drugs builds up meaning some conditions become incurable and so-called \u2018superbugs\u2019 such as MRSA develop.","Research has also suggested that antibiotic use in pig farming is common as poor living conditions mean such treatment is necessary to prevent infections spreading between livestock and that this passes down to humans through pork consumption, increasing resistance levels further.

He knows exactly what he's doing,\" over and over. Although the beleaguered Rubio campaign was quick to call it another Bush dirty trick, the Marco Robotos were animated by operatives from Democratic Super PAC American Bridge. Kevin McAllister, the PAC's deputy communications director-turned-costumed robot, said the campaign's only inspiration was provided by Christie, and the opportunity was irresistible.","Rubio strategists downplayed the attention their candidate's debate performance was getting. \"I think it's a narrow band of folks who read each other on Twitter,\" Jim Merrill, a Rubio senior advisor for New Hampshire, said, dismissing the entire affair. \"We're going to focus on President Obama.\" Any slip of the gears isn't going to affect Tuesday's results. \"We have a very strong ground game.\"","Merrill was also unconcerned by the fact that a morning pancake breakfast appeared to be transforming into a mid-morning rally. \"I don't know where they got the idea to come at 8:30. Nobody said that,\" he said. \"People just got here early,\" he explained, pointing out that the campaign was offering free muffins, berries, and juice.","Not everyone\u2014especially the hundreds who'd received the campaign's invitation for an 8:30 pancake breakfast\u2014was satisfied. \"It's the Marco Rubio pancake breakfast\u2014so far we've had no pancakes and no Marco Rubio,\" joked Bob Durant, a Rhode Island lawyer who was political touring with his family and friends. \"You wonder is it really because you have so many people,\" that things are delayed, Bob asked, or is it because, after the debate, \"He has to re-write his entire speech, since Chris Christie ripped it up?\"","His wife, Meg, was watching it all with more of an insider's eye. The Michigan state director for the Bush\/Quayle 1992 campaign, Meg Durant looks for the little things to tell her how a campaign is doing. After Saturday's Republican debate, she grabbed a couple of Christie and Bush signs for her kids. Some Christie volunteers followed her all the way back to her car. \"They waited for me to drive away,\" to make sure she didn't replace one of their Christie signs with a Bush sign. \"Christie's people, they are street fighters.\"","Still, she admitted, it's been difficult to predict how things are going. \"I thought Jeb had it. I thought he was a shoo-in,\" when the race first got underway. After Bush began to founder, \"I thought Marco would have walked away with it. But after last night...\" she gave a little shrug. \"I hope this morning is the Marco we want to see.\"","Durant was also finding it difficult to figure how event turnout, especially with the rising interest in political tourism, translates into votes. \"There are ten of us here,\" she noted, \"and only one of us is a New Hampshire voter.\" That would be her cousin, Tom Stevens, a retired lawyer who moved from Ohio to New Hampshire two years ago. He's still undecided; his wife was for Hillary Clinton until she went to a Clinton rally last week. Now, she's undecided, too.","When Rubio finally showed up a little after ten, he was as flat as, well, a pancake. \"A couple of housekeeping items,\" were the first words out of his mouth. \"We couldn't figure out how to make pancakes for 800 people\u2014I hope they fed you.\"","It didn't get better. He's still going to abolish the federal Department of Education, but he's decided to offer Tom Brady \"a cabinet position. Belichick, too.\" And then, because at best he can only really modify and not stop himself, \"Well, I'm going to say it again.... Barack Obama is the first president, at least in my lifetime, that wants to change the country. ... Not fix its problems; he wants to make it a different kind of country.\"","Things perked up a little bit when Rubio agreed to answer a few questions, calling on innocuous-looking white haired fellow in a bright flannel shirt. Identifying himself as Capt. Dan, a 65-year-old retired charter boat operator and a Rubio constituent from Florida, he wondered what a President Rubio would do about the climate change flooding that's putting his house in Miami Beach underwater. \"I'm going to get my money out of it and move to higher ground,\" Capt. Dan explained, who added that he doesn't expect to live forever. Isn't there something Rubio can do about climate change \"for the young people?\"","Rubio has a script for this question. Climate change legislation hurts the economy. It hurts the economy and has no real impact on the environment. The better approach is to support innovators of American energy. \"I say, 'OK, if we pass this bill how many feet of sea rise will it prevent?'\" he explained, reasonably, as he has on this and many other occasions. \"'Well, it won't prevent any sea rise.' OK, well how many degrees of temperature will it avoid going up?' Well, it won't do that either.\"","But afterwards, Capt. Dan professed to be happy with Rubio's response. \"Last time I heard him say it,\" which just happened to be in Manchester two days ago, \"he said it was too expensive, too difficult, wait.\" This time \"he started to look to the side a little bit, see a different way to see it.\" Possibly so. Reframing climate change as a family issue, not an environmental one, could certainly cause Rubio some cognitive dissonance. Very possibly that could be the conscious intent of folksy Capt. Dan, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire because \"this is such an intimate state where I have access to all the candidates....where I can ask the questions I want to ask.\" Folksy Capt. Dan Kipnis, who traveled all the way to New Hampshire on the dime of a climate change organization. Capt. Dan Kipnis, member of the Miami-Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force. Capt. Dan Kipnis, Director-at-Large, Florida Wildlife Federation. Capt. Dan Kipnis, adviser to former vice president Al Gore. Capt. Dan Kipnis, who has been trying to bring Marco Rubio to the climate change table for nearly 10 years now.","As the pancake-less attendees exited the school cafeteria, Merrill's \"very strong ground game\" was in action. Two young Rubio volunteers tried to nail down the vote, asking attendees to sign an \"I Pledge to Vote for Rubio\" The responses:","I'm not from here.","No, New York.","I'm from out of state.","We're from Connecticut.","We just came up from Massachusetts.","\"Thank you for making the drive,\" one volunteer repeatedly responded. It grew a little wearying. \"Nobody is,\" he started, and then corrected himself, \"There are a few people from New Hampshire.\"","Watching from a ledge behind him was Kaity Thomson, a recent University of New Hampshire graduate, who'd come to hear Rubio with her co-worker and friend Yuxi Wang. \"We were expecting pancakes,\" said Thomson, who is now working for 350.org, the international environmental citizens pressure group. \"It's crazy.\" Thomson, still undecided, did come away with something she could believe in, though: \"The visiting captain's story ...

According to Us Weekly, Kim snapped a photo of four products all from the luxurious La Mer brand \u2014 The Perfecting Treatment, The Concentrate, The Renewal Oil, and the iconic Cre\u0300me de la Mer. The total cost for this high-end skin treatment? A whopping $1,230. That\u2019s rent money, people.","For decades, La Mer has been the cre\u0300me de la cre\u0300me (no pun intended) when it comes to facial moisturizers. The brand\u2019s website claims it has the power to completely \"transform the skin,\" and making it look \"virtually ageless.\" With those statements, it\u2019s no wonder La Mer is a longtime favorite of makeup artists and celebs, as well as the source of legend \u2014 Mariah Carey was once rumored to use La Mer as diaper cream for her babies and Jennifer Lopez was said to have applied the stuff on her body from head to toe.

{"postId":"532201772509843456","postText":["Is there a better way to observe Veteran's Day?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["All this isn\u2019t to suggest that Americans never mark Veterans Day and Memorial Day. In communities across the country, members of the military, members of government, and military families gather on both holidays to raise and lower flags, decorate graves, and participate in processions and parades. On Memorial Day, some people observe the national one-minute Moment of Remembrance at 3 p.m., which was passed into law by Congress in 2000. Observation of the Moment is left up to participating organizations, such as Amtrak and Major League Baseball. And, as in the U.K. and Canada, the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) distributes poppies on Veterans Day and Memorial Day so that people can publicly commemorate the fallen. The numbers don\u2019t lie, though: according to the VFW, only 9 million poppies will be distributed in the U.S. (population: 316 million) this year. By comparison, 45 million poppies will be distributed in the U.K. (population: 64 million) for Armistice Day, according to The Royal British Legion. Why doesn\u2019t the United States have a common culture of commemoration? One potential explanation lies in the fact that the U.S. hasn\u2019t recently experienced the kind of generational destruction that, say, the First and Second World Wars brought to Britain and Russia, respectively. Britain lost approximately 2 percent of its population in the Great War, resulting in a \"lost generation.\" Jay Winter of Yale University told me that those men \"left behind ... a void, an absence, a black hole in the center of thousands of families defined in part by who wasn\u2019t there.\" The Soviet Union suffered an even more dramatic loss in the Second World War\u2014amounting to roughly 15 percent of its population. By comparison, U.S. losses in the Second World War constituted about 0.3 percent of the population, and 0.1 percent in the First World War. The only American war that incurred such steep losses was the Civil War, in which 2 percent of the population perished. It should come as no surprise, then, that the trauma of that conflict led to the establishment of Decoration Day, the precursor of Memorial Day.","Differences in how military holidays are observed can\u2019t be reduced to a numbers game, though. In the United States, at least, they may also stem from a strain of American thinking that highlights historical triumphs and skips over what those triumphs have cost. Lindsey Tepe of the New America Foundation, for instance, has written about the ways in which public education has become a battleground between those who view American history as \"a sweeping tale filled with ... grand heroes, epic battles, and the continuing struggle for the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,\" and those who recognize that \"American history is also full of inconvenient truths ... and the injustices perpetrated throughout the course of building this nation.\" Winter argues that \"what makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in American narratives of war.\" In the U.K., on the other hand, \"the absence of the Lost Generation mattered more.\" When America\u2019s national mythology and political discourse preach a tale of endless victory and exceptionalism, there is less of an incentive to focus on those men and women who didn\u2019t come home from battle. \"What makes U.S. commemoration different is the emphasis on redemption in its narratives of war.\" The finer details make a difference as well. Joe Davis, director of public affairs at the VFW, believes the All-Volunteer Force, established in 1973, drove a wedge between the military community and an ever-growing civilian population. During the Second World War, the United States fielded a conscription-based military of approximately 16 million people, out of a population of 135 million. Today, the professional military is well below its troop level during World War II, and the U.S. population has more than doubled in the interim. Davis also cited as a factor the shifting of Memorial Day from its original, fixed date of May 30 to the last Monday of May. \"When you link a military holiday to a three-day weekend, you lose the meaning of the day,\" Davis told me. Whatever the explanation, the lack of an appropriate occasion to commemorate America\u2019s war casualties has been noted. From 1989 until his passing in 2012, Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent. Separately, two bills have been introduced in Congress in the last two years alone\u2014one to establish two minutes of silence on Veterans Day, the other to do the same on Memorial Day. Neither bill has been passed, although the one for Veterans Day has since been revised as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The timing of these bills is opportune. Judging by recent polls, the American public is war-weary and largely of the view that the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were failures. A debate is also underway about what America\u2019s global role should be, with many Americans leaning toward isolationism (despite a surge of support for a more muscular U.S. foreign policy following ISIS\u2019s beheading of American journalists). In this environment, it would be worthwhile to rigorously observe a moment in which Americans collectively acknowledge the good that their country has done in the world\u2014and the real, human costs that have accompanied that involvement."],"targetTitle":"Is There a Better Way to Observe Veterans Day?","targetDescription":"Other countries offer models for truly nationwide tributes to military service and sacrifice.","targetKeywords":"The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life","targetMedia":["http:\/\/atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/atlanticprod\/1\/H.23.6--NS\/0","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/mt\/2014\/11\/RTR4DOTE\/lead_large.jpg","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/mt\/2014\/11\/RTR4DOTE\/lead_large.jpg?1430150302","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif","http:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/posts\/2013\/11\/veteranlarge\/a682ac40a.jpg","http:\/\/atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/atlanticprod\/1\/H.22--NS\/0","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/authors\/d\/edward-delman\/headshot\/headshot.jpg?1431456352"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/theatln.tc\/1qCr2IQ","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Yes.","spoilerPublisher":"SavedYouAClick"},"spoiler":["Senator Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, a World War II veteran, repeatedly introduced resolutions to return Memorial Day to its traditional date\u2014and, by proxy, its original intent"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,2198],[1,2370]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":239}

Social scientists and policy makers have some ideas, as do companies that have been trying to combat the problem in their work forces.","Publish Everyone\u2019s Pay","When employers publish people\u2019s salaries, the pay gap shrinks.","Jake Rosenfeld, a sociologist at Washington University, has found that salary transparency raises wages, in part by lending legitimacy to employees\u2019 arguments in wage bargaining. \"Even being cognizant of gender pay disparity being an issue can change norms,\" he said.","That has been true in the public sector, where disclosing pay information is often required. Alexandre Mas, an economist at Princeton, studied the effects of a 2010 California law that required cities to publish municipal salaries. It prompted pay cuts, but only among men.","Women might have been spurred to negotiate after seeing that their salaries were lower, he theorized, or cities might have made salaries more equitable to avoid lawsuits.","A few European countries have required that big companies publish pay information by sex. President Obama in 2014 required that federal contractors report it to the Labor Department. Other American companies say they have analyzed pay this way, though most do it privately.","Marc Benioff, the C.E.O of Salesforce.com, said last year that after such an analysis, the company spent $3 million to make women\u2019s salaries equal to men\u2019s. Kimberly-Clark and PricewaterhouseCoopers have said their examinations led managers to address the fact that fewer women were reaching top positions.","To Negotiate, or Not","Men are paid more partly because they\u2019re much more likely to ask for it.","When receiving job offers, 51.5 percent of men and 12.5 percent of women asked for more money, according to a study of Carnegie Mellon University graduate students by Linda Babcock, an economist at the university. In other research, she found that when women did ask, they asked for 30 percent less than men requested.","Because starting salaries determine raises and future salaries, women who do not bargain lose as much as $750,000 for middle-income jobs and $2 million for high-income jobs over their careers, Ms. Babcock found.","But her research and that of others has found that women are penalized for negotiating, while men are rewarded for the same behavior. (As the actress Jennifer Lawrence wrote in Lenny after the Sony hacking revealed that she was paid less than her male co-stars, she didn\u2019t fight for more because \"I didn\u2019t want to seem \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018spoiled.\u2019 \")","One solution, Ms. Babcock said, is to coach women to negotiate. Another is to change corporate practices so the people who set compensation are aware of the disparity and are advocates for women during negotiations.","Another answer is to ban pay negotiation completely. That is what Ellen Pao did when she was chief executive of Reddit. The company established pay ranges based on roles and experience and gave applicants nonnegotiable offers.","\"We put the onus on the company to pay fairly instead of on candidates to negotiate fair pay,\" Ms. Pao wrote in The Hollywood Reporter.","Don\u2019t Rely on Previous Salaries","If women can lose millions over their careers because they get job offers based on pay that is already low, one way to stop the pattern is to ignore their past salaries.","Google has said it does this and instead makes offers based on what a job is worth.","In August, the federal Office of Personnel Management said government hiring managers could no longer rely on an employee\u2019s previous salary when setting his or her new one. The acting director, Beth Cobert, explained that the practice particularly disadvantaged women who had taken time off to raise children. Women are also more likely to have worked in the lower-paying public or nonprofit sectors.","\"Don\u2019t ask about salary history for new hires, and it really reduces the impact of previous discrimination,\" Ms. Babcock said. \"I think that is the most effective thing organizations can do.\"","Make Work Easier for Mothers","Research has found that salaries at men and women\u2019s first jobs out of school are fairly similar. The gender pay gap widens a few years later when women start having children.","Sometimes their pay lags because they take breaks from work when their children are young, work fewer hours or take more time off than men for child care crises. Sometimes their employers assume they\u2019ll do so, even if they don\u2019t.","Policies that help keep women in the work force, like affordable child care, paid sick days and parental leave, could help. In states that offer paid parental leave, for instance, mothers are more likely to return to work, work more hours and earn higher wages, economists have found.","\"If a cashier gets pregnant, has no parental leave, has to leave and reapply for her job, that\u2019s not the same as making a career choice,\" said Philip Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. \"One thing policy can do is make it easier for women to stick with their careers.\"","Build More Flexible Workplaces","Ms. Goldin of Harvard has found that the pay gap is largest in occupations with the least flexibility in terms of where and when people work, like finance and medicine. The gap shrinks when people can work on their own schedules, as in many tech jobs and when people can easily substitute for one another, as happens among pharmacists. Then, women aren\u2019t penalized as much for working fewer hours.","Companies might address the culture of face time and overwork, and change how they operate. In a pharmacy, for instance, electronic medical records have made it easier for different pharmacists to serve the same patient.","Change the Law","Federal law doesn\u2019t require most of these things, so some lawmakers are trying other tactics.","The strongest equal pay bill in the country went into effect in California this month. It says that men and women must be paid the same for similar jobs, not just for exactly the same job at the same site, as the looser federal Equal Pay Act requires. The California law also prohibits employers from retaliating against workers for discussing pay.","Proposed federal legislation known as the Paycheck Fairness Act would require companies to report pay data to the government, give grants for negotiation training and make class-action lawsuits easier.

Using data from leading publishers, we will dispel the myths and demonstrate that there are no universal \"best times\" to share content on Facebook.","We analyzed the median traffic that articles received from Facebook three hours after they were shared. Using the median for all stories and a year\u2019s worth of data helped ensure the analysis wasn\u2019t skewed by outliers. Our analysis garnered some fascinating discoveries.","Firstly, when we compared three major publishers of national and international news based in South America, France and the U.K., we found significant variance in the shape of the traffic profiles for each publisher.","As can be seen in the above chart, the South American publisher achieved best performance when sharing between 11am and 4pm, and poor performance at other times. The British and French publishers, meanwhile, achieved more consistent results throughout the day, although both experienced peaks in referral traffic at different times.","It\u2019s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category \u2014 optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience. One explanation for this could be that daily routines and behaviors vary between countries and cultures, which therefore impacts media consumption patterns.","The natural next question is whether there are country-wide best times for posting stories on Facebook. Could it be that readers in France all consume content more consistently throughout the day than the South Americans? Can there be specific guides per country?","We compared traffic data from that same French news publisher with a top-10 French sports publisher of similar size and found that while before 10am they achieved similar results, the curves then diverge. By early afternoon, the news publisher is enjoying a strong peak in traffic, whilst the sports publisher is in a pronounced trough.","Overall, the sports publisher\u2019s traffic is more consistent, with fewer dramatic peaks and troughs, while the news publisher has clearly demarked periods when more readers are clicking through to their stories. Even for two publications of equivalent size working in the same country, there are stark differences in audience behavior depending on the subject matter of the content.","We also compared two similar publications in the same country and looked at the traffic profiles of two top-10 French news publishers. There were still crucial differences \u2014 when one publisher experienced a peak in share performance at 11am, it is in fact one of the worst times for the other publisher to be sharing.","Interestingly, there also seems to be significant variance based on article topic. We looked at 220,000 Facebook posts made by our publisher clients between March 20 and July 10, 2016, and sorted them according to the time of day at which they were shared. We then compared performance of posts based on whether the articles were about sports or technology. All shares were obtained using local time, in order to compensate for time zone differences, then normalized by average client performance and volume.","Again, there are important differences, and these nuances help us understand the characteristics of audiences and their varying appetite for particular content types at different times of the day.","But even these descriptions of the individual publishers do not do the subtlety of the data justice. To get the most accurate picture, a publisher would need to perform this analysis again on a real-time basis due to strong daily fluctuations. Indeed this is why many publishers now commit very significant resource to optimizing their performance \u2014 with large social media teams and even data scientists.","Featured Image: Nick Shepherd\/Getty Images"],"targetTitle":"When\u2019s the best time to share on Facebook?","targetDescription":"There\u2019s all manner of advice and guidance on the web for online publishers looking to optimize their social media efforts: CoSchedule, Fast Company,..","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/07\/messenger.jpg?w=150","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/facebook-messenger.svg","https:\/\/sb.scorecardresearch.com\/b?c1=2&c2=6036210&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=1.3&cj=1","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/crunch-network.jpg","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/brandbastion_logo.png","https:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/messenger-reactions.png?w=150","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/logo.svg","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/100x75.png","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/techcrunch_transparent_google_editor_picks.png","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/sport_technology.png?w=738&h=416","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/frenchnewsandfrenchsports-1.png?w=738&h=416","https:\/\/img.vidible.tv\/prod\/2017-03\/03\/58b9fa77d85a105723655d89\/58b9fad540752f4c6f8238c1_o_U_v1.jpg?w=300&h=170","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/postingtime.jpg?w=738","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/facebook-city-guides.png?w=150","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/postingtime.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/techcrunch-2013\/assets\/images\/1x1.png","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/ap-data.png?w=150","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/threenewspublishers_differentregions_version1.png?w=738&h=416","https:\/\/tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/twoleadingfrenchnewspublishers-1.png?w=738&h=416"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/09\/10\/whens-the-best-time-to-share-on-facebook\/?ncid=rss","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"We don't know.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["It\u2019s clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach for publishers, even if they are in the same category \u2014 optimal times vary depending on the location of the audience.

He\u2019s been dropped from a satellite dish in Goldeneye, shot through the neck with a grappling hook in The Island, peppered with arrows in The Lord of the Rings, and decapitated in Game of Thrones. But with the number of Sean Bean fatalities caught on camera brought back into the spotlight with his new show Legends, maybe it\u2019s time to put the many demises into perspective.","Start looking at the numbers, and many leading actors have died at least a few times. A long enough career can rack up the kills. For example, Robert de Niro has died on screen 19 times. Other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio have died 9 times. So where does Sean Bean fall along this list?","I crafted the following chart to find out:","Click to enlarge!*","It looks like the \"walking spoiler\" meme has a grain of truth to it. While Bean does have over 70 movies under his belt, he certainly dies in a lot of them \u2014 almost a third of his films.","However, even though Bean has perfected his \"I\u2019m dying\" face, he still hasn\u2019t died the most on screen. Two legendary horror actors, Vincent Prince and Bela Lugosi, each outpace Bean by at least 10 movies.","But the top honor of most on-screen deaths goes to wonderful character actor John Hurt. With over 120 movies, Hurt\u2019s death percentage is similar to Bean\u2019s \u2014 around 30% \u2014 but just seeing the list of Hurt\u2019s 43* deaths is impressive.","He has died in The Wild and the Willing, Sinful Davey, A Man for All Seasons, 10 Rillington Place, The Ghoul East of Elephant Rock, Spectre, Alien, The Elephant Man, Heaven\u2019s Gate, The Osterman Weekend, The Hit, After Darkness, The Black Cauldron, Jake Speed, Spaceballs, Aria, Deadline, Little Sweetheart, Scandal, L\u2019Oeil qui ment, Monolith, Even Cowgirls Get the Blues, Contact, The Climb, All the Little Animals, You\u2019re Dead, Lost Souls, Hellboy, Pride, Tabloid, The Proposition, V for Vendetta, Outlander, Boxes, An Englishman in New York, Ultramarines, Whistle and I\u2019ll Come To You, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Only Lovers Left Alive, Snowpiercer, Hercules, and finally the TV miniseries I, Claudius.","Maybe it should be #DontKillJohnHurt.","So is Sean Bean a walking spoiler alert? For that we could compare deaths per film to standardize among the actors. If we do that, Sean Bean is still at the top of the list with 0.32 deaths\/film, tied with Bela Lugosi, and followed closely by Mickey Rourke and John Hurt with 0.31 deaths\/film. Vincent Price and Cary Tagawa are next with 0.28 deaths\/film, and it decreases from there. (For the curious: South Park\u2018s Kenny barely beats Bean with 0.38 deaths\/episode.)","Of course, Bean has indeed racked up a large number of deaths early on in his career, relatively speaking (he has made far fewer films compared to Lugosi, Price, and Hurt). In the years to come, we could see Boromir bite the dust enough to become the undisputed duke of the death scene.","Kyle Hill is the Science Editor of Nerdist Industries.

After all, they are grandiose and self-righteous in a way that only a person with great power and questionable taste could truly appreciate. And the folks over at Ivory & Deene home furnishings completely concur.","To them, a chandelier is a holy object ordained by God to illuminate the rooms of only those who seek His approval and judgment. Consequently, homosexuals certainly aren't fit to hang such a blessed and holy fixture in a stage production where faggotry and fabulousness are main themes.","As we prepare to open our production of God Hates This Show: Shirley Phelps-Roper in Concert Live From Hell in New York City next month, we've been on the prowl for set dressings and items befitting a cabaret room located in the pits of Hell -- the setting of our play, which imagines the Westboro Baptist Church and Shirley Phelps-Roper having been damned to the underworld for all eternity.","It seemed that an elaborate (read: gaudy) chandelier, preferably red in color, should hang dramatically over the live rock band that is part of the show. Our hunt led us to the lovely, Christian businesspeople at Ivory & Deene. Impressed by the ornate lighting fixtures and reasonable prices, we decided to contact the management to see if we could negotiate a discounted price, as our theater company is a nonprofit with a very limited budget. What did we have to lose? We thought that the worst thing they could say was \"no,\" but it turns out that that's not the worst thing they could say. Here's what they did say to our producer Will:","We are sorry we will not support your production because we are Christians and we believe the first marriage God instigated was between and [sic] man and a woman and when he created them he said \"very good\", not just \"good\" like He did with the rest of creation, but \"very good\". Mankind has moved so far from the way God intended us to live, we must return to God's way of living, it is the best way and the blessed way, hope you can understand. Kind regards, Ruby","Punctuation, spelling, and grammar aside, Ruby obviously intended to make an example of us by denying us an item that surely only a homosexual would dream of purchasing anyway. (If you saw the chandelier, you'd understand.) She seemed intent on reaffirming her archaic and unfounded belief system by misquoting the Bible. (God did not say \"very good\" when he created man and woman. Look it up.) And rather than simply declining our request, as so many companies we have sought sponsorship from have, Ruby decided to do the least Christian thing she could think of: directly and personally judge and shame strangers. She may not have called us \"faggots,\" but she might as well have.","I worry about Ruby. She seems to be oblivious to the fact that a great deal of her clientele are most likely queer. I mean, come on. Girl is selling amazing satin sheets. Whether she knows it or not, Ruby is singlehandedly contributing to the decoration of bedrooms where abominations unimaginable occur. We're screwing on your sheet sets, Ruby. And in a way, a little part of you is screwing right along with us. Just thought you'd like to know. You're gay by association. Find a shower. Quick.","The truth is, Ruby can't be nai\u0308ve enough to think that she has never sold a product to a gay person. But the anonymity of the marketplace and the exchange of money for goods is all it takes for Ruby and Ivory & Deene to turn their heads the other way. Only when directly presented with the truth do they suddenly take issue.","Perhaps we'll directly and anonymously purchase the chandelier from Ruby and hang it proudly on our set. I also have a full page of ad space that I don't know what to do with. Maybe this:","The chandelier in tonight's performance comes from Ivory & Deene's collection of exquisite heteronormative lighting. To find out if you yourself are fit to own these fine straight-people products, ask yourself this: \"Do I like gay sex?\"","This question might also help you determine whether or not you'll dig our show.

Our \"Sacred Spaces\" series explores where your phone is unwelcome. From the mundane to the truly unique -- from yoga class to family dinner to your bath tub -- we are spotlighting the environments where you are truly unplugged. Want to share your own? Send us your story here.","I\u2019ve been taking ballet all my life since I was very young, and while I did spend time during high school as part of a company, it has mostly been a lifelong hobby. As an undergraduate [at Howard University], at Harvard Business School, and as I moved to different cities -- Denver, Boston, Detroit, New York -- I'd always find a ballet studio. It just brings me so much joy to dance.","To me, a sacred space should really be where you can practice something that brings you pure joy. And something that helps you celebrate what it is to be human. In this case, ballet is all about the human body and what you can do with the human body in a graceful way.","Something about having the barre, the wooden floor, the pianist, the instructor, made me feel as though all else was outside. It became this sacred space. And though it was a place that was all my own -- where I could challenge and test myself -- it was also a collaboration with others, because truly you dance together, not by yourself.","Everyone who is there has opted in simply because they love ballet and they enjoy dancing. So there's something about being with the like-minded women (and some men!) who are there with me.","The truth is, that during class, I never looked at my phone. But one time I did and it became a reminder for how sacred the space should really be. My boss emailed me, during the break, between the barre and the floor exercise and I had just decided to check my email. Email draws you in and there\u2019s always some action item -- something that triggers a response.","For the rest of the class, it made it much more difficult to concentrate. Remembering the exercise, going across the floor. That one email check pulled into class what I should be doing after class. I lost being in the moment, being present and the joy faded. I realized that I had invaded my sacred space with technology.","And though I didn't typically look at my phone, once I set up the rule that I would not look at my phone for those 90 minutes, it became a new form of self-discipline and a gift to myself of 90 minutes in which everything else can wait.","Bonita Stewart is Vice President of Partner Business Solutions at Google.

{"postId":"828174076447490049","postText":["SalesforceVoice: 3 ways to make your company more sales intelligent"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["You've heard of street smarts and book smarts. But is your company sales smart? If you're like most organizations, the answer is probably not really. Sales teams face two perennial problems. No matter their industries or how large their companies, most lack a properly implemented training regimen and the resources to do their jobs efficiently.","You can have insanely talented salespeople, and they'll still make the same mistakes over and over again if they don't have proper training. When people don't feel they're supported because they're constantly wanting for resources, they eventually burn out. But many companies fail to address these needs within their sales department, and they end up losing their top representatives because of it.","Becoming Sales Intelligent","Modern technology didn't create a training or resource crisis, but it did change the types of tools and training that social selling requires. Rapidly shifting sales techniques demand a proactive attitude toward salesforce development. Productivity tools have enabled salespeople to work smarter and spend more time interfacing with clients than managing mundane tasks. The flip side of this is that prospects and customers expect rapid results and constant access. Sales teams must be prepared for the 24\/7 nature of their jobs.","This is where sales intelligence comes in. Sales and marketing overlap more than ever before. Organizations that rely heavily on cold-calling for lead generation need to know whom to target and how to reach them with actionable messages.","A few years ago, they would have used simple Google searches and corporate websites to piece together this information. Now, a multitude of services help businesses identify prospects, collect contact information, load the data into their CRMs, and schedule drip campaigns. In this sense, many sales reps are operating their own mini-marketing departments.","Sales intelligence encompasses this entire data-gathering process. It includes all the contextual information you need about your sales contacts: purchase histories, industries, response rates, and other metrics that help you tailor your strategies to each target. The better you know your audience, the more effective your campaigns will be. That's Sales 101. But sales intelligence platforms enable you to put that concept to work by building more detailed profiles than were possible in the past.","Still, the concept of sales intelligence is relatively new. Sales managers and executives are understandably wary of investing in tools and strategies if they're not clear on how the business will benefit. Sales intelligence tools improve efficiency and can increase conversions and profits. But they're effective only if you approach them correctly. Here's how to build sales intelligence within your company:","1. Emphasize productivity.","The greatest virtue of sales intelligence tools is that they save so much time. You most likely hired your reps on the basis of their sales acumen, not their stellar research skills. Rather than having them spend hours scouring the internet for details about prospects, intelligence tools get them to the right people and companies faster. Cultivate a passion for productivity among your sales teammates. They'll be thrilled to try out new platforms that provide them with more time to do what they do best: sell.","2. Evaluate potential ROI.","The big questions with new tools are always: How much will this cost? And what's the ROI? Analyze the amount of time and resources that can be saved using different platforms. Then, compare that with the cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining the new systems. That will tell you whether sales intelligence is worth the investment. Usually, the answer is yes.","3. Investigate key features.","Sales managers often tell me they're reluctant to adopt sales intelligence platforms because the tools aren't intuitive. They may have watched a demo video or presentation and come away feeling more confused than they were to begin with. If you've experienced this, know that the fault probably lies more with the sales rep who led the demo than with the product itself. Have patience and seek out the features that are relevant to your organization.","Sales intelligence is critical to your company's growth. What obstacles are preventing you from embracing these tools, and what would inspire more confidence in them?"],"targetTitle":"SalesforceVoice: 3 Ways To Make Your Company More Sales Intelligent","targetDescription":"You\u2019ve heard of street smarts and book smarts.

This is in line with the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games (about $566, even though that medal was 31 grams heavier). However, it is a long way off from the approximate $708 record price of the 2012 London gold medal, due to the record high price of gold and silver at the time.","If the entire medal was made of gold it would be valued at nearly $22,000, which is why 1912 was the last time all-gold medals were awarded.","A total of 2,488 medals were produced for the Rio 2016 Olympics (812 gold, 812 silver and 864 bronze) by the Mint of Brazil. All of the medals are the same size and weight, with a diameter of 85 millimeters and a weight of 500 grams, making them the heaviest medals in the history of the Summer Olympics and tied for the largest medal in the Summer games. At least three Winter Olympic medals were larger and heavier.","Each of the 812 Olympic gold medals is plated with six grams of gold (the minimum required by the International Olympic Committee) with 99.9 percent purity. The remaining 494 grams is made of silver with 92.5 percent purity (the standard for sterling silver), according to the Mint of Brazil. The purity silver standard also is a minimum IOC requirement.","Each of the 812 silver medals contains 500 grams of sterling silver. The podium value is about $305. The 864 bronze medals contain 475 grams of copper (95%) and 25 grams of zinc (5%). The bronze medals have little intrinsic value.","For the first time in history, according to Rio Olympic officials, the medals are designed in a curved dome-shape, higher in the center, so the thickness ranges from 6 mm to 11 mm.","Sustainable Design","The medals were produced with methods that the Rio 2016 Olympic officials described as \"symbols of sustainability and accessibility .\" More than 30 percent of the silver used in the production of the medals are recycled from mirrors, waste solders and X-ray plates. The gold is mined entirely free of mercury. More than 40 percent of the copper used in the production of the bronze medals came from the industrial waste of the Mint of Brazil through a process that was developed internally.","Even the ribbons attached to the medals were well thought out with half of the materials woven from recycled polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) yarn (recycled post consumer polyester made from bottles). Each medal comes with a sustainably sourced wooden box, certified by the Forest Stewardship Council, that contains a miniature sculpture of the Rio 2016 logo.","The front of each medal has the Rio 2016 logo framed by laurel leaves (which were given as awards for the ancient Olympics). The reverse reveals the traditional etching of , the Greek goddess of victory, in the foreground and the Greek Panathnaic Stadium in the background. Above Nike is the engraving of \"XXXI Olympiad\" and the Olympic Rings. Adding a personal touch, the name of the event in which the medal was awarded is engraved by laser along its outer edge.","Paralympic medals with new sound innovation","The 2,642 Paralympic award medals were made by the Mint of Brazil and are of the same weight, dimensions and materials as the Olympic medals. The design is highlighted by a trail of seeds that wraps from the front to the reverse side of the medal.

{"postId":"4lcm0n","postText":["Chewbacca Mom Shares REAL Reason Her Video Blew Up The Internet"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["In the age of viral media, it\u2019s not uncommon for a video to go crazy viral or a post to been seen by millions of eyes.","In fact, never before in history has someone had the ability to be plucked from obscurity and rise to a national \u2014 or international \u2014 platform as quickly as in this 21st century digital age.","We see it all the time: from the announcement of Sarah Palin as a running mate in 2008; thrusting her into the spotlight from obscurity, to the boy who cried \"Damn Daniel\" on Vine and ended up on the Ellen show and just about everywhere else. It\u2019s surprisingly easy to make a name for yourself and garner 15 minutes of fame.","The newest member of the \"Gone Viral\" club is none other than Texas native Candace Payne. A wife of nearly 15 years and mom to two youngsters, Payne seemed to be all over your Facebook Newsfeed and everywhere else on the internet over the last few days when a Facebook Live video of her unboxing a \"Chewbacca\" mask and laughing hysterically went mega viral.","We\u2019re talking \u2013 \"It broke the internet.\"","Literally, Candace Payne\u2019s video has set new records as being the most-viewed Facebook Live video with over 133 MILLION views.","But just hours after her video blew up the internet, Payne goes on record with the real reason she put on that mask, and we \u2013 for the first time \u2013 have begun to understand why Candace\u2019s little stunt is about more than just a funny moment dressed as Chewbacca in the front seat of a car.","She walked into Kohl\u2019s to buy yoga pants, but little did Candace know that God had other plans for her.","\"I honestly wasn\u2019t there for the mask,\" Payne told \"I honestly wasn\u2019t there for the mask,\" Payne told Good Morning America . \"I was there for myself for some yoga pants because I\u2019m trying to work out more. And it\u2019s not really going that well, but I ended up going to the toy section because I got discouraged about the yoga pants and I thought, \u2018Maybe not today. But I can get a toy for my kids.\u2019 And I walk through the toy section and I accidentally bumped my shoulder into this box. And I had seen this before, but I didn\u2019t realize it made sounds until that moment. It accidentally started making the growl, and I went, \u2018I need to get that. Like, I don\u2019t think my kids need that, I think I need that.\u2019\"","A few minutes later, Candace is in her car only 30 minutes away from needing to be \"responsible\" as she puts it, and pick up her children from school. But with only a few minutes to spare, she couldn\u2019t contain herself and decided to do an \u2018unboxing\u2019 in her car and show her friends on Facebook her new find.","So with a smile that\u2019s worth more than its weight in gold, she introduced herself to the interwebs and began to take the \"Chewie\" mask out of the box and put it on.","Then laughter ensued. Candace says she tipped her head back and caught a glimpse of herself in the rearview mirror and she couldn\u2019t contain the belly laugh that came out of her. And as she saw the reactions of people responding live to her post, she got even more vivacious. To the point that she couldn\u2019t stop laughing and tears flowed out of her eyes.","I was struck by a very distinct feeling the first time I watched Candace\u2019s hilarious video. I\u2019ve seen plenty of viral videos before \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s a part of my job. But something is different about Candace Payne.","\"For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 14:17","Candace is no ordinary \"15-minute-famer.\" In fact, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Candace\u2019s influence extends long past 15 minutes.","Not only is Payne adorable and obviously so much fun, it turns out that she\u2019s someone who loves Jesus too. And boy does it show. Candace is active in her church, The Oaks Fellowship in Red Oak, Texas (just outside of Dallas) and she\u2019s a dedicated wife and momma.","Just 48 hours after her video had gone viral, Candace got up on stage with a message to young creatives at an Arts conference in Texas, and gave nuggets of wisdom that are clearly directly from Heaven.","\"When I was 16, I had a vision and a dream from the Lord about my future being used for His glory. I didn\u2019t understand the interpretation of it. I still to this day, at 37-years-old, try to figure that dream out. But that dream has never left my heart, nor my mind, nor the way that I walk and follow Jesus. And I know that God has gifted me in many different areas and sometimes, I feel like I wake up and I\u2019m a Jack-of-many-trades and a master-of-none because I have that creative buzz in me, constantly going,\" said Candace.","But here\u2019s where her words get really good.","\"It doesn\u2019t matter how talented, how anointed, how gifted, how passionate, or how willing you are if you\u2019re not fit to do the things that God has called you to do... And that is spiritually fit. The thing that will take you further and farther in the Kingdom of God is three things: diligence, patience, and obedience... Do not try to make a name for yourself. His name will always outshadow yours.\" -Candace Payne","And that\u2019s not all of the mic drop moments Candace spoke. Take a look at her whole encouragement to the kids at the Regional Fine Arts event:","\"I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in Him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.\" -Romans 15:13","One of the markers of Jesus\u2019 work in your life is that you have joy. It doesn\u2019t mean that you never feel sad or have a bad day, but it does mean that an unspeakable exuberance and delight fills you that sometimes there aren\u2019t words to explain.","Often, a hallmark of the Holy Spirit\u2019s work in your life is joy. And many times that comes in the form of laughter \u2014 deep, beautiful laughter \u2014 that not only releases joy in you, but in the lives of others.","Candace Payne\u2019s video went viral not just because she\u2019s delightful and hilarious and so much fun to watch (although all of those things are true). Her video caught the attention of millions of people because she is FILLED with the love and joy of Jesus. And God used a beautiful daughter from Texas, in a Chewbacca mask; deciding to look past her discouragement about not finding yoga pants that fit, and find happiness in something as simple as a plastic Star Wars toy to bring joy to people\u2019s lives.","\"Your love has given me great joy and encouragement, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the Lord\u2019s people.\" -Philemon 1:7","Don\u2019t believe me?

The Bible says that His joy is our strength. If you are lacking joy in your life, start by asking God to give you His joy and then belly-laugh along with Candace. Then go and spread your joy with others and you\u2019ll find that your joy will be always flowing.","And apparently Candace agrees with me as she said this morning on Good Morning America :","\"I think the world as a whole, is in need of a good laugh. I think we\u2019re in need of somebody to lift our spirits, to not take ourselves too seriously and to break some cynicism \u2014 worldwide.\"","Thank you so much Candace Payne for sharing the joy of the Lord that is inside of you with the world. You have no idea how inspiring you really are... Or maybe you do since you let the fruit of the Spirit come out of you so freely. Either way, thank you, from the bottoms of our hearts for bringing more joy to the world through your laugh and letting your light shine.","\"Those who have been ransomed by the LORD will return.

So-called realistic optimists combine the positive outlook of optimists with the clear-eyed perspective of pessimists, new research has found.","These realistic optimists may get the best of both worlds, using their realism to perform better at work and elsewhere, but aren't getting bogged down by unhappiness, said Sophia Chou, an organizational psychology researcher at National Taiwan University, who presented her findings at a meeting of the American Psychological Association in Honolulu, Hawaii earlier this month. [7 Things That Will Make You Happy]","Optimists and pessimists","Past research has shown that optimists value thoughts that make them feel good about themselves, whereas pessimists prize a more truthful vision of themselves. But a clear-eyed view can be bad for pessimists' well-being, as they tend to be more prone to depression, Chou said.","Optimists tend to live longer and be healthier overall.","After several years working in business, Chou noticed there were some people who were both optimistic and realistic, and that they tended to be very successful. She wondered whether realism and optimism were really diametrically opposed.","So Chou administered a battery of personality surveys to about 200 college and graduate students in Taiwan. The surveys tested how many \"positive illusions\" the students held, as well as whether they were more motivated by self-enhancement or reality.","Realistic views","The optimists sorted into two camps: the realists and the idealists.","\"Realistic optimists tend to choose accuracy over self-enhancement; the unrealistic optimists tend to choose self-enhancement,\" Chou said.","Interestingly, the realistic optimists also got better grades, on average, than their less grounded peers -- probably because they didn't delude themselves into thinking they would do well without studying or working hard, Chou said.","Traditionally, a more realistic outlook is paired with poorer well-being and greater depression, yet the realistic optimists managed to be happy. To understand why, she dug deeper into the personality assessments.","Self-control key","She found that realistic optimists believed they had more self-control and control over their interpersonal relationships.","\"Every time they face an issue or a challenge or a problem, they won't say 'I have no choice and this is the only thing I can do.' They will be creative, they will have a plan A, plan B and plan C,\" Chou said.","That allows them to stay cheery and upbeat about the future, even if they recognize the challenges of the present.","Being a realistic optimist does have one downside, however: They are more prone to anxiety than their completely unrealistic peers. That's likely because they recognize the possibility of failure, whereas their counterparts use positive illusions to ease their anxiety, Chou said.","The findings suggest that realistic and unrealistic optimists may actually be very different personality types, Chou said.","In order to cultivate a rosy-but-realistic outlook, people should maintain a clear-eyed view of reality, but emphasize what they can control in most situations, she said."],"targetTitle":"Realistic Optimists May Have More Success And Happiness, Study Suggests","targetDescription":"By Tia Ghose, Staff Writer \r\nPublished: 08\/24\/2013 12:01 PM EDT on LiveScience\r\n\r\n Are you a \"glass half-full\" or a \"glass half-empty\" kind of person?...","targetKeywords":"optimistic realist,realists well being,optimists well being,optimists,realistic optimist,Third Metric","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/237081\/slide_237081_1190729_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1318532\/images\/n-OPTIMIST-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1318532\/images\/o-OPTIMIST-facebook.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1fe3ELi","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Realistic optimism","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["realistic optimists"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,52],[1,71]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":258}

","Now body language expert Judi James has revealed the key signs to look out for if you're concerned someone is being economical with the truth. ","While she warns that there is 'no set formula' for spotting a liar, recognising some of the signs can help you root out a fibber. ","'Forget all those claims of \"tells\" and other body language giveaways that reveal when someone is being economical with the truth. ","'A bad liar might blush and sweat and show physical signs of agitation like fidgeting,' she explained. ","'But a practised liar can easily deliver a lie while looking cool, calm and confident. ","'Despite the fact there are no \"one-size-fits-all\" symptoms to spot, the following tips should help alert you to the fact that someone\u2019s not being totally honest with you.'","The big pause: Lying is quite a complex process for the body and brain to deal with. First your brain produces the truth which it then has to suppress before inventing the lie and the performance of that lie. ","This often leads to a longer pause than normal before answering, plus a verbal stalling technique like \u2018Why do you ask that?\u2019 rather than a direct and open response.","The eye dart: Humans have more eye expressions than any other animal and our eyes can give away if we\u2019re trying to hide something. ","When we look up to our left to think we\u2019re often accessing recalled memory, but when our eyes roll up to our right we can be thinking more creatively. Also, the guilt of a lie often makes people use an eye contact cut-off gesture, such as looking down or away.","The lost breath: Bending the truth causes an instant stress response in most people, meaning the fight or flight mechanisms are activated. ","The mouth dries, the body sweats more, the pulse rate quickens and the rhythm of the breathing changes to shorter, shallower breaths that can often be both seen and heard.","Overcompensating: A liar will often over-perform, both speaking and gesticulating too much in a bid to be more convincing. These over the top body language rituals can involve too much eye contact (often without blinking!) and over-emphatic gesticulation.","The poker face: Although some people prefer to employ the poker face, many assume less is more and almost shut down in terms of movement and eye contact when they\u2019re being economical with the truth.","The face hide: When someone tells a lie they often suffer a strong desire to hide their face from their audience. This can lead to a partial cut-off gesture like the well-know nose touch or mouth-cover.","Self-comfort touches: The stress and discomfort of lying often produces gestures that are aimed at comforting the liar, such as rocking, hair-stroking or twiddling or playing with wedding rings. We all tend to use self-comfort gestures but this will increase dramatically when someone is fibbing.","Micro-gestures: These are very small gestures or facial expressions that can flash across the face so quickly they are difficult to see. Experts will often use filmed footage that is then slowed down to pick up on the true body language response emerging in the middle of the performed lie. ","The best time to spot these in real life is to look for the facial expression that occurs after the liar has finished speaking. The mouth might skew or the eyes roll in an instant give-away.","Heckling hands: The hardest body parts to act with are the hands or feet and liars often struggle to keep them on-message while they lie. ","When the gestures and the words are at odds it\u2019s called incongruent gesticulation and it\u2019s often the hands or feet that are telling the truth.","Judi James is supporting Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s new Murder Mystery fundraising game Whodunnit? and says learning how to lie might help if you decide to take part. ","'While I don\u2019t usually condone lying, this is the perfect opportunity to try your hand at being economical with the truth,' she said. ","Convince yourself first: The brain likes to see the whole manufactured story which it can then perform using body language. Don\u2019t just think of the transcript, visualise the whole story including all the smallest details.","Visualisation is the nearest you\u2019ll get to making the lie reality and that helps make your body language signals congruent.","Relax: To combat the fight\/flight response, breathe out slowly and deliberately to relax your muscles, especially the ones in your shoulders, arms and hands. Keep your vocal tone a little lower - lying can make us more shrill.","Slow your blink rate: Fibbing often causes a give-away accelerated blink rate. Slow your own down a little, as this will help create reassurance in your audience.","Keep busy: If you\u2019re not very good at lying, try to keep busy when you perform the lie. Actors call this a \u2018bit of business\u2019 which is when less competent actors continue washing up or potting plants while being quizzed rather than struggling with their body language. Sip a cup of tea etc. ","It might look rude but it can be better than over-sharing in terms of your body language giveaways!","Tell the truth first: In an emergency such as: \u2018Do you like my new hair cut?\u2019 or \u2018Am I the best lover you\u2019ve ever had?\u2019 it can help if you expel the truth first. For example, \u2018It looks terrible!\u2019 or \u2018No you\u2019re the worst!\u2019 followed by \u2018Only joking, of course you\u2019re wonderful!\u2019","Macmillan Cancer Support\u2019s new Murder Mystery fundraising game \u2018Whodunnit?\u2019 takes place on Saturday 25th March.

Eyebrows were raised because Pacquiao had already declared his dedication for public service even prior to his win during the national elections.","So what was the truth?","The 37-year old boxer unretired for another fight.","Manny Pacquiao announced his retirement, which lasted for 3 months, after his unanimous win against Timothy Bradley.","Pacquiao did not deny his eagerness to come back to his career of 21 years which made him a household name and a worldwide recognized boxer when he rose in eight divisions.","After the game which gave Mahindra a 105-103 win against the defending champion of the Governors\u2019 Cup, the San Miguel Beermen, he confessed to a horde of journalists his aspiration to add another win under his belt. According to him, boxing helped him provide for his family and he does not want to consider his job as a senator as his livelihood.","With Las Vegas in mind as the venue, Arum set the date of his fight on November 5. Instead of the usual camp in Hollywood with Freddie Roach, the senator\u2019s camp will be in the Philippines in order for him to still be able to fulfill his duties as a politician.","Pacquiao was elected twice as the congressman of Sarangani before he ran for Senate. His 4 days of attendance in Congress became controversial.","It was in May 2015 after his loss against Floyd Mayweather Jr. when news of his retirement floated around.

{"postId":"395020772004986880","postText":["Why it's definitely worth it to get your flu shot"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Oct 28 - When her law office offered flu shots in mid-October, Kelly Walsh, a paralegal in Boston, hesitated.","Walsh didn't get vaccinated last year and didn't get sick. The year before, she had flu-like symptoms for a week after getting the shot.","\"I also worried if everyone at work knew I got a flu shot, it'll be harder to take sick days if I do get the flu,\" says Walsh, 38.","Ultimately, however, Walsh got jabbed, and experts agree it was the right call. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting a flu shot reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization by 71.4 percent for all adults and 76.8 percent for those over age 50 during the 2011-2012 flu season.","The CDC estimates deaths associated with the flu number between 3,000 and 49,000 people each year.","One reason people don't get vaccinated is cost. Flu shots aren't always free. Most insurance does cover vaccinations administered at a doctor's office. But walk into your local CVS or Walgreen and you'll likely pay at least $35. Insurance won't necessarily cover shots at retail pharmacies.","Employers can help bring down those costs - and likely save themselves money as well. The CDC estimates that seasonal influenza outbreaks average $10.4 billion in direct costs due to medical treatment and hospitalizations. Part of those costs are then passed along to employers in the form of higher premiums and lost productivity.","Typically, more than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for flu-related illness. Many large firms like Walsh's offer free flu shot clinics, but letting workers know they won't be penalized for taking sick leave can also pay dividends for businesses big and small.","Last winter was a big year for influenza, and it caught many patients and healthcare providers off-guard after several years of milder flu seasons. It's too early to know how this year's will compare or even how many people have come down with the flu so far this autumn since those numbers, tracked by the CDC, weren't reported during the recent government shutdown.","Flu activity usually peaks in the United States in January or February. Recent studies from the European Union show the vaccine offers less immunity and has a shorter duration than previously thought, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of the infectious disease division at the Minnesota Department of Health. \"But now is the time to get vaccinated,\" she adds.","What's new this year, says Dr. Michael Jhung, medical officer at the CDC, is that many flu shots will immunize against four strains of the flu virus for the first time, an improved protection over years past. Drug companies plan to make 135 million to 139 million doses of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration.","Several vaccination options are available. They include: a standard dose for adults and children, a high-dose shot for people over age 65, a nasal spray for those who don't like needles, and a dose that is egg-free for patients who are allergic.","Everyone over the age of 6 months should get one, experts say. \"We don't prefer one vaccine over another,\" Jhung says. \"Whatever vaccine patients choose, we're happy.\"","The elderly, children under age 5, pregnant women, and people with other chronic health conditions are most vulnerable to the flu.","Getting immunized earlier guarantees protection whenever the flu season starts in earnest, Jhung notes. Plus, adults who don't get vaccinated can put others, including children, at risk. Only 42 percent of Americans got vaccinated in the 2011-2012 flu season, the latest data available from the CDC.","As an added bonus, a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that up to 36 percent of those vaccinated reduced their risk of heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular health problems just by getting a flu shot. Based on these findings, the researchers calculated that one death or serious illness due to heart trouble could be prevented by vaccinating 58 additional people.","Peter Delgado, a 66-year-old self-employed accountant, recently left a Cambridge, Massachusetts, Rite Aid before getting his flu shot. \"There was too much paperwork to fill out, and they wanted to charge me $70,\" says Delgado, who lives nearby. The high-dose version of the shot, recommended for older people, often costs more than the normal vaccine.","His wife, however, soon sent him back in. \"I told him, 'If you get sick from the flu and can't work, you'll feel foolish over $70,'\" says Anne Delgado, 66, who is retired. \"One shot could mean food on the table for us.\" (Follow us @ReutersMoney or at http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/finance\/personal-finance; Editing by Lauren Young and Meredith Mazzilli)"],"targetTitle":"Why It's Worth It To Get Your Flu Shot","targetDescription":"(Corrects spelling throughout to Dr. Michael Jhung instead of  Dr. Michael Jhang) By Kathleen Kingsbury","targetKeywords":"flu vaccination,flu shot,influenza vaccination,reuters","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/partner-reuters-b01d8aebbd29264b97b1091b01adfcb2a4156fac6a93708b2a27a3ae383dd009.png","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1431080\/images\/o-FLU-SHOT-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1431080\/images\/n-FLU-SHOT-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/274100\/slide_274100_1968597_free.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1diCmVr","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"It reduces your risk of getting the flu","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["reduced the risk of flu-related hospitalization"],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,222],[3,269]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":274}

Recent research has found a link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being.","The Kansas State University study, which will be published in the journal Financial Planning Review, found that well-being is generally not a priority for workaholics.","\"We found workaholics -- defined by those working more than 50 hours per week -- were more likely to have reduced physical well-being, measured by skipped meals,\" doctoral researcher, Sarah Asebedo, said in a statement. \"Also, we found that workaholism was associated with reduced mental well-being as measured by a self-reported depression score.\"","To figure out why some choose to work overtime even when they know it's not good for health, the researchers turned to a mathematical analysis called Becker's Theory of the Allocation of Time, which helps to measure the cost of time. The theory highlights the paradox that working overtime leads to more income, but less time to spend this income. it also suggests that as income increases, workers are more likely to develop unhealthy habits around working excessively.","\"[Becker's Theory] looks at the cost of time as if it were a market good,\" Asebedo said in the statement. \"This theory suggests that the more money you make, the more likely you are to work more. If you are not engaged in work-related activities, then there is a cost to the alternative way in which time is spent. Even if you understand the negative consequences to workaholism, you may still be likely to continue working because the cost of not doing so becomes greater.\"","The findings are based on data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth that included 12,686 young men and women. All the study participants were interviewed each year until 1994, and are still interviewed biennially.","Of course, it's no secret that overworking can have a negative effect on your health and happiness. A number of studies have shown the detrimental toll that work stress in particular can take on your health, including depression and an increased risk of heart attack and diabetes. And workaholism in particular has been associated with poor sleep quality, weight gain, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety, not to mention unhappy marriages and higher divorce rates.","And with the possibility to work from anywhere, at anytime, it's easier than ever to become a workaholic in the first place. More than eight in 10 Americans are stressed about their jobs -- citing an unreasonable workload as their number-one stressor -- and 61 percent of employed vacationers will work through their vacation this year (up from 52 percent last year).","But turning on that out-of-office autoreply and taking some time to rest and recharge can actually have a positive effect on not just your well-being, but also your productivity. Even a short nap can boost cognitive functioning, improving creative thinking, learning and memory.","\"Renewal is not for slackers,\" Tony Schwartz, CEO of The Energy Project, told the Huffington Post. \"Renewal is a way in which to increase your capacity to be more effective.\""],"targetTitle":"Workaholics May Face Poor Physical And Mental Well-Being, Study Suggests","targetDescription":"If you're addicted to checking your email and regularly work through evenings, weekends and vacations, you might be a workaholic -- and your health may b...","targetKeywords":"well-being-committee,work life balance,overworking,work stress,Third Metric,workaholics,work stress health,work and well-being,redefining success,workaholism,workaholics health,the future of work","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/306096\/slide_306096_2641494_free.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1313760\/images\/n-WOMAN-WORK-STRESSED-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1313760\/images\/o-WOMAN-WORK-STRESSED-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1dMpR74","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"May Face Poor Physical And Mental Well-Being; 50+ hours\/week","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["link between workaholism and reduced physical and mental well-being"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,208],[0,275]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":276}

Cyber detectives and some Overwatch fans are hopeful about this and are keeping a keen eye on the hints provided by Blizzard on their videos. They are also gathering all the information about the new character available on the web and piecing them together.","A story about this was covered in detail by NeoGaf, where they compiled a couple of sources which indicates that the new support character named Sombra can come to Overwatch soon.","To start with, they pointed out to a French theater ad which suggested that Sombra will be unveiled for Overwatch soon. Soon after, the theater where the ad was shown later claimed that the tease in the ad was a typo. However NeoGaf user, Nirolak, who compiled the article believes that the theater is lying as Blizzard had already confirmed about working on two new heroes.","Pointing at the second clue Nirolak wrote, \"Way back in November, people noticed that there\u2019s a table in Dorado with files for Soldier 76\/Jack Morrison and Sombra. Given Soldier 76 is Jack Morrison, this only leaves the mysterious Sombra file, which would fit with a Soldier 76 vs. Sombra animated short.\"","Sombra has also made several appearances in various stages. She wears a metal grey helmet which is highlighted by blue, along with a gray over hood and a blue under hood. The grey and blue combination in her outfit is the main reason she is thought to have ties with Soldier 76 and Reaper.","Nirolak also mentioned about Reaper\u2019s dialogue in the game where he says, \"Where is Sombra when you need her?\", which can be another massive hint.","Apart from these, there has also been information that Sombra was seen in the character select screen along with a sniper scope, which is another strong signal that the character might be on its way to Overwatch soon.","There are also speculations that Sombra could well be a villain, who would join the other villains on the game later. Overwatch is already short of villains and this can be a logical speculation, but anything cannot be confirmed until we hear it from Blizzard.","At this point we can certainly say that there\u2019s something or someone called Sombra, which is directly or indirectly related to Overwatch, but it\u2019ll be interesting to find out what Blizzard thinks on this.","We\u2019ll update you as soon as we come across more news on this.

That means even Vin Diesel -- who, thanks to the \"Fast and Furious\" movies, stars in one of the most popular film franchises in existence -- had to independently finance the third \"Riddick\" movie. How did he get here?","Let's start with \"The Chronicles of Riddick,\" the sequel to \"Pitch Black,\" which was released on June 11, 2004. The film, which cost around $110 million, grossed just $57 million at the North American box office, making it one of that summer's costly misfires. After that result it was understandable that a studio -- in this case, Universal -- was leery about putting more money into the franchise, even at this new film's reported bargain budgetary cost of $38 million.","Maybe, though, that was for the best. In this new installment, we find Riddick (Diesel) left for dead on a desolate planet. After a lengthy recuperation segment, the focus of the film shifts to a group of bounty hunters who are on the planet searching for Riddick. So, Riddick, the character, shifts from our hero to, as \"Riddick\" director David Twohy calls him, \"the bogey man.\" It's something Twohy, who also directed the previous two installments, says would never have happened had this been a straightforward studio movie.","Did you ever think this third movie would ever happen after \"The Chronicles of Riddick\" underperformed?","Yeah, I had my doubts after the second one. And we suffered some slings and arrows. According to the studio, we spent way too much money and didn't make enough back. So, that's never a good formula. So, I had my doubts. If you speak with Vin, I'm thinking he would say, \"Never a doubt that we were going to do a third movie\" -- because that's just the kind of guy he is. He is a big dreamer. I'm more the pragmatist of the duo.","Vin Diesel has had quite the resurgence over the last couple of years.","Look, I've learned never to count Vin Diesel out. Just don't do that. And I guess it's because he is a very smart guy. Smarter than people give him credit for.","I enjoyed that in \"Riddick\" the stakes are big to the characters, but not compared to all of the big summer movies we just saw. These people basically just need to leave a planet and that's it.","And look, I've been in those meetings, too. Where it's, \"We have to up the stakes. We have to give it a ticking clock\" ... So, I hope that \"Riddick,\" if nothing else, feels a little more handmade than factory-made. That's what I set out to do and Vin was certainly along for that ride, too.","The first half hour, we're pretty much alone with Riddick. Then the film focuses on the bounty hunters and Riddick becomes almost the bad guy, even though we spent the first part of the movie with him.","That's right. Now, that's something the studio would have fret out about. \"Wait a second. You are totally sympathetic with Riddick while he's trying to survive, but then you're using him as the bogey man.\"","Why did you want to do that?","Because he is both those things. He is a man. He is a survivor -- a survivor with skills. And enough personal code that he can be sympathetic to us, but, at the same time, never let the audience forget that he's a stone cold killer. But, you know I think it works. Because I have to introduce those new characters ... I have like 10 new characters to establish. And I can bolster Riddick's roar -- his legend -- by having them talk about him as they glimpse him.","Do you think the success of the \"Fast and Furious\" movies helped to get \"Riddick\" made?","Yes. But, here's the cyclical nature of the business. Because \"Pitch Black\" did well, that allowed him to be part of the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise. And guess what? What goes around, comes around. So, on the basis of that, he was dropped into a major part in \"The Fast and the Furious.\" And based on the success of that, yes, that does impact on our ability to launch this third one. Even though Universal didn't want to make it at a certain point. In fact, they didn't make it. Do you know that story?","I do not.","It goes like this. After \"Chronicles,\" they said, \"We are out of the Riddick business. It's just a straight business calculation of us. You spent too much money and you didn't make enough back. So, no, we're not going to do anymore.\" Vin, being the savvy guy he is, said, \"Well, give me the rights back.\" And they didn't want to do that ... I think this was about the time that \"Fast 3\" had already shot and they were testing it. Maybe it wasn't testing as well as it should have and they decide, \"Maybe we need a cameo from Vin\" -- because he wasn't in that movie. So, I do believe that in his savviness, Vin said, \"Don't pay me for that cameo. Just give me the rights back.\" So, his company basically controls the rights and because I control all of the sequels and remakes. So, we can't make a movie without each other, nor would we want to. So, that's how he got the rights back and I think that was a great business move.","So, ultimately, we did it as an independent movie. I wrote a spec script. We sold it in Berlin for international. We came back into town looking for a domestic partner. I thought it was going to be Sony or Film District -- they were both eager to have the movie. And then, guess what? Universal raises their hand, \"Well, what about us?\" And I said, \"This doesn't feel right to me\" But Vin, he was saying, \"That was then, this is now\" ... So with the \"Fast and Furious\" franchise and his relationship with Universal over that and the strength of those, we placed it again at Universal. So, the company that kicked us to the curb [laughs] picked up the movie and will be distributing it in the U.S. and Canada.","So Universal didn't put any money into the film?","They put money into it for their domestic distribution rights.","So Riddick is an indie film?","Here's an example of how it's an indie film. I wrote a spec script, we sold that. We went up to Montreal and I think I did one polish on my original script -- and then we shot that. Then, when it comes to editing, I got to the point when I wanted to show it to 50 people in a room, just to see what they understood: What was clear to them and what was not clear to them. Because of things aren't clear to them, the audience can't enjoy it and I still have time to go to the editing room and clean it up. I didn't have it scored and didn't fill out forms, I just stood in front of them and asked them questions ... I had the studio heads in once, but we were basically locked at that point. So, very pure filmmaking. Very pure.","Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

I moved here to Lincoln and learned that other riders wave a lot. They expect you to wave back. It\u2019s almost like a religion.\"","Brandt said the waving was the impetus for his purchase. He rode in on a 2012 Honda Shadow, which he traded in to Frontier Harley-Davidson towards the purchase price of his new motorcycle.","\"When you ride a Harley, you just don\u2019t have to wave,\" Brandt said. \"If a guy on a Suzuki doesn\u2019t wave, you have to wonder if he didn\u2019t see you, or if he was using the clutch.

The reports indicate that at least half of his staff will be laid off in the wake of Clinton\u2019s victories in New Jersey and California, though some of them might be offered jobs in Sanders\u2019 Senate office.","A lot of the staff members who are being laid off are advance staff who often help with the logistics of setting up a campaign, but a lot of the field staff, who often handle phone calls and door to door campaigning, are being laid off as well.","The reports of the layoff came after Clinton\u2019s victory on Tuesday where she won the majority of delegates in California and New Jersey. It is important to note that despite Clinton\u2019s strong lead, she does not have enough pledged delegates to earn the nomination. She currently has 2,184 compared to Sanders 1,804. There are 158 pledged delegates still available and 2,383 are needed to win the nomination.","Clinton, who has been declared the party\u2019s nominee by many in the media, such as the AP, does have the support of more than 500 super delegates, which is what puts her over the top. Super delegates are party officials who can support either candidate. The super delegates will not vote until the Democratic National Convention, which will be held the last week of July.","Despite the layoffs, Sanders is not ending his campaign and is hoping to be able to sway the super delegates to his side. Sanders will argue that he is the strongest candidate to face Donald Trump in November. It is an argument that Sanders has made throughout this primary season and it\u2019s one that the poll numbers back up. The majority of polls have Sanders defeating Trump by a larger margin than Clinton does. A spokesman for the campaign, Micheal Briggs, reiterated this plan during a statement at a Sanders rally that was held on Monday in San Francisco.","\u2018Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump\u2019","Sanders has a long road ahead of him if he hopes to convince the party\u2019s super delegates to back him over Clinton, as many of them have been strong supporters of her campaign since she first announced her candidacy. The Clintons have enjoyed strong support among the Democratic Party since Bill Clinton\u2019s election in 1992. Whether or not Sanders can persuade the party\u2019s leadership to back him remains to be seen, but it is a long shot.","A spokesman for the Sanders campaign, Briggs, has said that the senator is planning on heading back to Vermont on Wednesday, but will be back on the campaign trail by Thursday when he will head to Washington, DC. Sanders is planning on holding several rallies in Washington DC, which holds the last primary on June 14th."],"targetTitle":"JUST IN: Bernie Sanders Makes MAJOR Announcement To His Entire Staff And Followers (QUOTES)","targetDescription":"Sources close to the Sanders campaign have reported the senator will soon be laying off at least half of his staff in wake of Clinton's victories.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-CR_FUckkEtQQm.gif","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/cooper-page.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/logo1-300x58-300x58.png","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/tr1.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/bernie-and-hillary-2.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/647511766.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/Joy-Behar-The-View.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/logo_big-300x58.png","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/trump-2.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/632063886.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/2017-03-03_10-59-43.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/GettyImages-642417872-1.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.bipartisanreport.com\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/24050281453_b64d18d320_z-e1465402581985.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/bipartisan.report\/2016\/06\/08\/just-in-bernie-sanders-makes-major-announcement-to-his-entire-staff-and-followers-quotes\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"The Sanders campaign will be laying off staff as the primaries draw to a close. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - World News"},"spoiler":["begin laying off a large part of his staff starting Wednesday"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,82],[0,143]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":288}

{"postId":"805842201611800576","postText":["Here\u2019s the secret way people are using Snapchat Spectacles. \n(Hint: sex)"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["When Snap CEO Evan Spiegel described Spectacles\u2014his company's first piece of hardware, a pair of video-shooting sunglasses\u2014in a September Wall Street Journal story, he called them a \"toy.\"","There's more than one type of a toy in this world, however, and there's one Spectacles use case we're not yet seeing, at least not publicly: Spectacles as a sex toy.","Of course, behind closed doors, it's already happened.","\"It was the first thing I thought as we were waiting in line,\" said media entrepreneur Rachel, who bought a pair from the first popup shop in Venice Beach with the guy she's seeing. (Names of users have been changed by Mashable at their request for privacy.)","SEE ALSO: People are already hacking their Snapchat Spectacles","Rachel's not alone. Financial analyst Richard was interested in filming himself in the act with a recent girlfriend. He saw the perfect opportunity, when he got a pair of Spectacles from the shop in New York.","\"It seemed easy, and better than a phone,\" he told Mashable. \"I liked my point of view instead of a side table, because it feels more authentic. I was there, and this is what I'm seeing, and I remember what I was feeling when I re-watch the videos.\"","Snap will soon be a big, public company, but not that long ago it was just an app commonly associated with sexting. Its foundation in disappearing messages\u2014the once-unique feature that made Snapchat a must-have\u2014made sending naughty material seem less risky, even if it's with a complete stranger. And sure, Snapchat's built out their product to appeal to different users, in different ways, via the news-focused Live Stories and publisher perspectives on Discover (which is a Mashable partner). But by releasing a physical product like Spectacles, Snap Inc. has repositioned itself as a lifestyle tech company. And with this comes the potential, of course, for innovations in sexual pleasure and fun.","To wit, take our friend Richard's feedback: \"The circular video part\"\u2014which is how Spectacles films footage, where users watching Spectacle-shot media can look around the footage, simply by moving their phone\u2014\"was really cool.\"","\"By turning my phone,\" he continued, \"I get a whole new vantage point.\" Of his own amateur sex footage, he means. And maybe, one day, someone else's.","The idea was an obvious one for some Snapchat users, Rachel and Richard included. Right after the initial Spectacles rollout, people were already cracking the same joke on social media. The idea was practically floated by Snap themselves in the marketing for Spectacles\u2014photos of models, donning the sunglasses, while shirtless.","you have to be naked to use spectacles fyi pic.twitter.com\/klm9kZM7B2","\u2014 Damon Beres \u2728 (@dlberes) September 24, 2016","How will sex tapes change after Spectacles?","\u2014 Alex Micu (@axelk) September 27, 2016","Snapchat Spectacles are gonna be great for filming realistic porn because A) the camera is at your eye level B) it lasts ten seconds pic.twitter.com\/QosgVH3j9e","\u2014 Gary He (@garyhe) September 24, 2016","But you know what they say\u2014there's truth in every joke. And this one's time is coming.","Given the limited availability of Snapchat Spectacles, the sexual accessorizing of them has yet to begin in earnest. Mashable reached out to more than two dozen Spectacles owners and found that the majority hadn't engaged in any sexual act with their new toy.","Yet\u2014most of them have at least had the idea.","\"I hadn't thought about that as a personal use, but one of my first thoughts was when we'd see this pop up in porn,\" one early Spectacles owner explained.","\"My friends have talked about all the possibilities that can be made with these, including sex,\" another said. \"The Specs will definitely be 1000% less creepier than Google Glass.\"","Of course, there's the idea, and then the execution. And people have definitely been executing on the potential for Spectacles as a sex toy. So far, reviews are mixed.","Of the 26 Spectacles owners we spoke with, Mashable did hear from several people who wore the glasses during masturbation, foreplay and sex.","\"I've used it by myself just to dance around and be sexual, and also, used it in the beginning stages [of sex] when I was still getting intimate with a partner,\" Rachel, the media entrepreneur, said.","\"With the glasses on, it definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit.\"","The experience wasn't seamless. Rachel and her partner chose to wear one pair of glasses and pass them back and forth during foreplay. Spectacles also only records up to 30 seconds, with the press of the button three times.","\"It definitely takes you out of the moment a little bit,\" she said.","It wasn't Rachel's first time making a home sex video and while she appreciated the new visceral perspective Spectacles had to offer, wearing the glasses were a bit distracting, and made her feel more than a little self-conscious.","\"There was a barrier, in terms of personal space. I didn\u2019t feel as close to the person, because one of us had the sunglasses on,\" she said.","Jennifer, a publicist, said she and her partner both wore them the first time, which felt fun, but two pairs of Spectacles make for strange bedfellows\u2014literally. To say nothing of the viewing, itself.","\"We thought we would try it, but the first five minutes we were laughing. I think teal\"\u2014the color of her Spectacles\u2014\"was a bad choice,\" she said.","\"I deleted the videos right after, and we tried again.\"","A series of 10-, 20- and 30-second clips are now saved on her personal iPhone, which Jennifer said she's privately masturbated to, and also, sent to her boyfriend.","While Rachel had the idea to use them for sex early on in her Spectacles ownership, she was initially concerned about whether or not her videos would post instantly to her Story.","They don't. The app saves all Spectacles videos in a dedicated tab within your Snapchat Memories. Still, due to privacy concerns, she downloads the Stories off of the app, deletes them from Snapchat, and then stores them in a personal, private folder.","\"I'm a little skeptical about how much Snapchat can see,\" she said.","Richard and Jennifer saved their videos in \"My Eyes Only,\" a section of the app protected by a pin code, which Snapchat released back in July.","As for professional, non-amateur use in sex, we couldn't track down any examples using Spectacles, but one could still\u2014and isn't unlikely to\u2014show up in the near future.","Jesse Adams, co-founder and CEO of adult content app platform MiKandi, says his company is already looking at the potential of Spectacles. \"We haven't gotten our hands on one yet, but with the adult industry, any time there\u2019s a new gadget, we\u2019re very excited in terms of how to explore it,\" he said.","His company embraced the first wearable camera, Google Glass, and used it to create an app called \"Tits and Glass\" as well as film a parody porn video back in 2013.","\"The question is what appeal will these Spectacles have, if any, to this industry. Will they see these as a different kind of POV niche that it might be able to financially profit from or build a more general porn viewership,\" said Lynn Comella, associate professor of gender and sexuality studies at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. \"Will it be different from Google Glass?\"","Snap declined to comment for this story, but a spokesperson pointed to the Snapchat support and safety pages for reference. Spectacles' support page has no direct mention of using Spectacles during sex. The gadget's warnings page addresses flying and driving, however.","All sex-related context is, for now, designated to the community guidelines for Snap and Snapchat. That's not too surprising given that Spectacles only upload videos directly to Snapchat. A pornography section of its community guidelines states, \"Snapchat prohibits accounts that use public Stories to distribute sexually explicit content.\"","There's no control or limitation to what users do with Snapchat privately, of course.","Cindy Gallop, an advertising industry veteran and consultant who is now focused on a social sex site called MakeLoveNotPorn, said she wished Snapchat would be more explicit and embrace the use case.","She credited Snapchat's \"explosive growth\"\u2014which now boasts 150 million daily active users\u2014to sexting, and though Mashable can't prove that, it's clearly a part of the app.","\"Spectacles can be and will be used in sexual context,\" Gallop said. \"I would love to see Snap be open and active about it.","In fact, Spectacles owners have some recommendations. \"The glasses kept slipping off. I remember thinking at the time: I wish there was a strap,\" Richard said.","Just as Snapchat inspired a third-party market for app solutions, there's bound to be  accessories for Spectacles.

{"postId":"4kq3li","postText":["How Trump could win."],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Joe Raedle\/Getty Images","At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. He\u2019s made real ground on Hillary Clinton, closing the gap between them by consolidating the Republican Party behind his candidacy. Clinton, meanwhile, is fighting a contentious primary, which keeps her from doing the same. There\u2019s still a strong case to make that Donald Trump is a long shot for the White House\u2014that he\u2019s too unpopular with too many Americans outside the Republican Party and that if the Obama coalition holds, he loses.","Jamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.","At least, that\u2019s what I think. But humility is a virtue, and life is volatile, even if elections often aren\u2019t. That Trump is a poor bet for November doesn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t win. He could. Which raises an obvious question: How would it happen? And finding an answer here isn\u2019t too difficult. You just need to reverse-engineer the conditions of a Trump loss. What are those conditions?","At the top of the list is demographics. Trump is deeply unpopular with black and Latino voters, as well as with women and young people. But Clinton is also unpopular, albeit by a smaller magnitude. Given two unpopular candidates, it\u2019s possible that \"popularity\" just won\u2019t matter as much, that voters will take both candidates\u2019 worst qualities as a given and move on. In which case, both Clinton and Trump become generic nominees. And what are the prospects this year for a generic Republican nominee? Of five separate econometric models of the election, four predict a Republican win ranging from 50.9 percent of the vote to 55 percent of the two-party vote. The economy is middling, President Obama well-liked but not hugely popular, and Clinton would be a third term for Democrats. Given two generic candidates under those criteria, the presidency would go to the Republican. Say hello to President Trump.","Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t trust the models (they couldn\u2019t predict Trump, after all). Then what? How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? The answer is easy: He wins and turns out white voters in historic numbers. Assume higher nonwhite support for the Democrat\u2014let\u2019s say a three-point bump among blacks and a seven-point bump among Hispanics, giving Clinton 97 percent and 80 percent support, respectively\u2014and Trump needs 66 percent of whites to win both the popular and electoral-college vote, if turnout doesn\u2019t change. (You can play with the numbers over at RealClearPolitics.)","How would Trump win, assuming key parts of the electorate are aligned against him? He turns out white voters in historic numbers.","It\u2019s an extraordinary reach: an increase of nearly six points over the white share in 2012, matching Ronald Reagan\u2019s performance in 1984. It would mean Trump persuaded millions of Democrats to switch teams, despite their wide approval for President Obama.","In other words, it\u2019s not happening. Partisanship has a tight hold on American voting behavior, and it\u2019s hard to imagine how Trump could break it, barring a national catastrophe. Easier to imagine is higher white turnout. If Trump could reverse the yearslong decline and bring white turnout back to its 2008 levels\u201474 percent\u2014then he could win with another couple percentage points among whites, even with the high black and Latino turnout of 2008. This would give him teetering Democratic states such as New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, as well as the three largest swing states: Florida, Ohio, and Virginia. It\u2019s a heavy lift, especially for a candidate who says he will eschew data-gathering and other quantitative methods for finding and mobilizing supporters. But it\u2019s possible.","OK, OK. \"Possible\" doesn\u2019t mean \"likely,\" and it\u2019s hard to imagine a disorganized campaign exceeding Team Romney\u2019s ability to pinpoint and bring Republican-leaning white voters to the polls. Still, with a smile from Fortuna (or whichever god of chance you prefer), Trump can win. If anything guarantees defeat for an incumbent party, it\u2019s a recession. At the opening of the 1960 election, in early spring of that year, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were neck and neck. This continued into the summer and the early fall. But by October, Kennedy had opened a small but persistent lead. He won.","It\u2019s hard to isolate a single cause for Kennedy\u2019s victory, but he was almost certainly helped along by the modest recession that struck in the spring and lasted until the following winter. If not for that downturn, there\u2019s a fair chance Nixon would have become president. A sudden slowdown could have the same effect on our election. In fact, the very presence of Trump\u2014his proximity to the most powerful office in the world\u2014could destabilize markets and make a downturn more likely. And consider this: On average, the United States sees a recession every five years. We\u2019re due. One is all we need for President Trump.","A terrorist attack could do it\u2014driving voters into the arms of the authoritarian in the race\u2014but the literature is mixed on how terrorism affects voters. It could make them more attuned to perceived outsiders\u2014and immigrants in particular\u2014giving Trump an advantage. It could push them toward hawkish candidates with traditional credentials, helping Clinton. Or given the candidates, it could be a wash. So let\u2019s table this one.","There\u2019s one last thing that could deliver the White House to Trump: a divided Democratic Party. Party unity is a prerequisite for national competition. It\u2019s why the \"Never Trump\" movement fell apart after Ted Cruz left the race; a serious effort to derail the Republican nominee would guarantee a Democratic White House, because it\u2019s almost impossible to overcome the asymmetry. In the still unlikely event that the present acrimony between Bernie Sanders and the Democratic Party becomes an outright split, Democrats risk throwing the election to Trump, through in-fighting and division. If Sanders runs as a third-party candidate, the game is over, and Democrats lose. You see this in the most recent polling. Clinton\u2019s biggest weakness in the NBC News survey of registered voters is with Sanders\u2019 backers who haven\u2019t crossed the threshold to Team Clinton. If this persists, it\u2019s dangerous. If history is any indication, however, it won\u2019t be.","With all this said, even the most probable scenario here\u2014that Trump and Clinton become generic candidates\u2014is a distant long shot. They\u2019re just too well-known for voters to treat them as interchangeable with any Republican or any Democrat. And their personal qualities mix with the fundamentals of this election\u2014partisanship, demographics, and economic performance\u2014to create favorable terrain for Democrats."],"targetTitle":"It\u2019s a Long Shot, but Here\u2019s How Trump Could Win","targetDescription":"At this moment, polls show a strong upswing for Donald Trump\u2019s campaign.

In the 1980s, union members in blue states defied their leaders in organized labor to vote for the 40th president.","Well, in Nevada, the first of the early primary or caucus states with a significant number of Latino voters, we\u2019ve caught a glimpse of a similar phenomenon\u2014one that few could have imagined when Donald Trump entered the race for the Republican presidential nomination.","You may recall that the billionaire businessman launched his foray into politics eight months ago with a speech that declared that Mexican immigrants were \"bringing drugs\" and \"bringing crime,\" and that they were \"rapists,\" criminals and murderers even though, he assumed, \"some are good people.\" Now, it seems, some of those good people are enamored of their tormentor.","Behold, the Trump Latinos.","According to CNN entrance polls, among Latino Republican voters in the Silver State, John Kasich got 4 percent, Ted Cruz 18 percent, and Marco Rubio 29 percent. Trump got an astounding 44 percent.","I can only think of two people who don\u2019t seem surprised by Trump\u2019s strong showing with Latinos.","The first is Trump himself, who has been saying for months that he would do well with Hispanics. In fact, Trump would often point to early polling from Nevada that showed him beating his rivals decisively with Hispanics, which is what happened.","Trump has a theory. He thinks that Hispanics know that he will create jobs and that many of these jobs will go to Hispanics because his years in business have taught him that Hispanics are especially hard workers.","The other person who saw this coming was me. Two weeks ago, I wrote a piece for this site that looked at the phenomenon of \"Latinos for Trump.\" That piece was criticized by everyone from white Democrats to Latino activists to Republicans supported other candidates.","Now, if you look at the entrance polls out of Nevada, it seems clear that these critics don\u2019t know much about Latinos.","Granted, these surveys are not the definitive final word. This was a small sample of voters, and many polling experts doubt the accuracy of entrance polls. Besides, we are talking about just Latino Republicans who went to vote on a given day in the state of Nevada. That\u2019s hardly a representative sample of Latinos across the country.","And, finally, it is worth noting, most Latinos weren\u2019t even on the table for Republicans in Nevada because more than two-thirds of the community are registered Democrats. In fact, if Trump is ultimately the Republican nominee, it will almost assure a Latino landslide for Hillary Clinton, who could walk away with as much as 80 percent of the Latino vote.","Still, all those caveats and conditions don\u2019t change what happened in Nevada, or its significance. We need to unpack that.","But first, let me explain a few things about my tribe. The 54 million Latinos in the United States\u2014whose ancestors can be traced to more than a dozen countries\u2014could yield an estimated 13 million voters in November. And many of those voters will be in three battleground states\u2014Nevada, Colorado, and Florida.","Next, there is no suspense as to which party will scoop up the lion\u2019s share of those votes. It\u2019s the same party that has won the majority of Latino votes in every presidential election since 1960: The Democratic Party. No Republican presidential candidate has ever won the majority of Latino votes.","Finally, while many in Washington will often try to compare Latinos with African-Americans as another aggrieved minority that has endured everything from inferior schools to overt discrimination to economic inequality, there is a competing line of thought that suggests Latinos are more comparable to other Catholic immigrant groups, like the Irish and Italians.","Like their European immigrant brethren, Latinos want to come to their ethnicity on their own terms. They are fiercely patriotic Americans who nonetheless identify as Latino. And they don\u2019t feel as if they must choose one over the other.","That is relevant to this discussion because, as one reader put it to me recently: \"If these voters think like Americans, they\u2019ll vote for Trump. If they think like Latinos, they won\u2019t.\"","Now, here\u2019s what happened in Nevada. The Latino community in the United States\u2014and especially the nearly 70 percent of that population that is Mexican or Mexican-American\u2014is highly aspirational. They don\u2019t settle. They want better lives for themselves and their children. They want success. They don\u2019t hate Trump. They want to be Trump.","In states like Nevada, Colorado, Texas, Utah, and others, far away from the nation\u2019s power triangle (New York-Boston-Washington), there were many average Latinos living ordinary lives who are being drawn to Trump and his promise to \"Make America Great Again.\" Like many other Americans who are flocking to the real estate mogul, these Latinos want to know what it\u2019s like to live in a country that is always winning and winning.","And what about Trump\u2019s inflammatory comments about Mexico and immigration along our southern border?","It\u2019s complicated. While generally more appreciative than other Americans of immigration, respectful of the contributions of legal and illegal immigrants, and supportive of a comprehensive reform plan that provides the undocumented with a path to earned legal status, many Latinos are also ambivalent about illegal immigration\u2014especially if they, or their ancestors, came legally.","They\u2019re leery of immigrants who abuse the system and feel entitled to make demands of the country that took them in, while waving the flag of the country that cast them adrift. They\u2019re also fed up with what they see as a new militancy among the undocumented immigrants of today\u2014particularly young DREAM\u2019ers who were brought here as children and seem to understand everything about this country except what it demands of its citizens and those who aspire to be citizens.","Like Trump, these Latino voters know something is wrong with the nation\u2019s immigration system. They might not agree with his proposed solutions, but they\u2019re not going to hold against him the fact that he\u2019s brave enough to start the discussion. Besides, when Trump blasts Mexican immigrants as criminals, many Latinos just assume he\u2019s talking about someone else.","Meanwhile, we shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprised that the chattering class completely missed the \"Latinos for Trump\" story. Much of it fell into their blind spot.","The East Coast media don\u2019t get Latinos. Neither do the political parties. Ditto for most commentators, pundits, and political strategists. In fact, just about everyone with an opinion has the wrong opinion about Latinos.","For instance, they all seem to think that Latinos are demanding from government and other institutions that they be siphoned off into their own separate group and showered with preferential treatment and special accommodations. Not true.","Latinos don\u2019t want to apart from America, and they aren\u2019t in conflict with America. They are the essence of America."],"targetTitle":"Yes, Donald Trump Won Latinos Over Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

Syda Productions\/Shutterstock","Though there don't appear to have been any recent developments on this issue, the Internet \u2013 largely led by English tabloids \u2013 has decided that it's time to remind us all about a 2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital, which found evidence that drinking too much soda can reduce a man\u2019s sperm count by as much as thirty percent.","Exactly why this has suddenly become so widely talked about is a bit of a mystery, since as far as we are aware there is no new research to speak of. However, the findings of the study are worth bearing in mind if you happen to be a lover of the self-appointed \"Real Thing\" (and a man).","After examining the potency of 2,500 men, the researchers discovered that those who identified as cola addicts had an average sperm count of 35 million per liter. Though this is not actually considered to be below the healthy limit, it is pretty far short of the 56 million sperm per liter that non-soda addicts were found to have swimming around their testes.","How these popular drinks produce this plunge in sperm numbers is not known, although the researchers have ruled out caffeine as the cause, after finding no connection between caffeine in other drinks and sperm count.","A number of other studies have in the past attempted to find a connection between excessive soda drinking and poor sexual health in men, though most have found no concrete proof of any link. For instance, back in the 1980s, researchers added a variety of Coca-Cola products to sperm in an attempt to see if it reduced their swimming ability, but ultimately did not find enough evidence to support this.","More recently, researchers published a report in which they listed several reasons why drinking too much soda could potentially cause erectile dysfunction. For instance, they explain that high sugar intake could cause some of the blood vessels in the penis to become clogged up with fat, impeding blood flow and making it harder to get an erection.","As such, they conclude that there is a high probability of a connection between soft drinks and soft penises, though they can\u2019t confirm this without conducting a long-term study."],"targetTitle":"According To This Study, Drinking Fizzy Drinks Can Have A Disturbing Effect On Your Penis","targetDescription":"Reports suggest drinking too much cola could reduce a man's sperm count by 30 percent","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-environment.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318083&cs=075600f372&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ilss-logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo_narrow.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316330&cs=c58cc2de06&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=18981470&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316406&cs=69f403dc56&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318082&cs=f932d0946b&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=d6f5031c43&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316414&cs=6c4ace3c1f&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-space.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ifls-placeholder.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=23fc1c635f&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316354&cs=07106bb0fd&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-technology.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316385&cs=24a66e6205&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318081&cs=87fb1c7e69&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-plants-and-animals.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/19d83c49-0204-5ea9-ae40-aeedf26a99b4\/author_large-1465220073-ben-taub.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-editors-blog.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-the-brain.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-chemistry.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/4ac0e524-1d05-50cb-a812-8f8039d208e8\/default-1467992875-cover-image.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-health-and-medicine.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316331&cs=ff36d3abd8&cb=1487689717","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-physics.png?v=1.2.0"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.iflscience.com\/health-and-medicine\/according-to-this-study-drinking-fizzy-drinks-can-have-a-disturbing-effect-on-your-penis\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"It reduces sperm count. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Pilipinas"},"spoiler":["2010 study by scientists from Copenhagen University Hospital","reduce a man\u2019s sperm count by as much as thirty percent"],"spoilerPositions":[[[1,179],[1,239]],[[1,294],[1,349]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":303}

The president-elect is an unpredictable political force who could dramatically change U.S. priorities at home and abroad.","Here's a list of 2017's biggest risks, according to WEF, Eurasia Group and Control Risks.","An inward turn for the U.S.?","Trump has criticized NATO allies for not spending enough on defense, promised to scrap free trade agreements and questioned U.S. involvement in conflicts abroad.","Trump's approach amounts to a rejection of \"American exceptionalism,\" the idea that the U.S. should actively promote democracy, civil rights and the rule of law around the world, according to Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group.","Bremmer said Trump sees international cooperation in purely transactional terms: \"If there's not an obvious, near-term benefit for the U.S. ... it's not something the U.S. should be doing.\"","An American retreat from the world stage is bound to cause problems for its allies.","\"The fact that the country that has been the linchpin of the global order since [World War II] is no longer available for service, that is absolutely the top risk in the world today,\" added Bremmer.","Angry voters","Widening gaps between rich and poor, and old and young, are fueling feelings of resentment.","WEF said that while inequality between countries has been decreasing over the past 30 years, inequality within many developed nations -- including the U.S. and Britain -- has risen. The group pointed to Brexit and Trump's election as clear signs of a backlash against the status quo.","\"Rapid changes of attitudes in areas such as gender, sexual orientation, race, multiculturalism, environmental protection and international cooperation have led many voters -- particularly the older and less-educated ones -- to feel left behind in their own countries,\" the WEF said in its annual risk report.","In Europe, France, Germany and the Netherlands will all hold major elections in 2017. Populist and eurosceptic parties could make major gains, and further undermine the region's precarious political balance.","China - opportunity or risk?","China has a lot to worry about in 2017. Trump has threatened Beijing with punishing tariffs and even questioned the U.S. position that Taiwan is part of \"one China.\"","Experts say the relationship between the world's two biggest economies could change radically in 2017.","Despite real policy differences, the two powers have avoided major conflicts in the past in order to protect their crucial trade and investment relationship.","\"As of January, when Trump takes the oath of office, the feeling is no longer mutual,\" wrote Andrew Gilholm and Michael Moran of the consultancy Control Risks.","The analysts said it's unclear how the relationship will play out should Trump implement the anti-China policies he promised during the campaign.","\"Leaders in Beijing are vastly more experienced, but we have little precedent for how they may react if pushed and provoked by the U.S. on issues where China is most sensitive,\" Moran and Gilholm wrote.","Russian disruption","A reduced geopolitical role for the U.S. could further embolden Moscow to \"act as a rogue and disruptor,\" said Bremmer.","And President Vladimir Putin won't be chastened by allegations that he ordered Russian intelligence agencies to disrupt U.S. elections.","\"He'll hack away at the French and other upcoming European votes.

{"postId":"396395351667531776","postText":["Where \"Kanye West\" is more popular than \"Jesus Christ\""],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, though, has West's embrace of the Son of God been as fervent as his last album, \"Yeezus,\" which title is a portmanteau of West's nickname (Yeezy) and Jesus. The album also features a direct Kanye-Jesus comparison in the song \"I Am A God\": \"I know he the most high \/ But I am a close high.\"","With Kanye bringing a Jesus lookalike on stage during his current tour, The Huffington Post decided now is a good time to compare the relative places of Kanye and Jesus in the popular zeitgeist.","To do this, we analyzed a year's worth of Twitter data (from Oct. 21, 2012 to Oct. 20, 2013) via the third-party service Topsy. When comparing Jesus and Kanye on Twitter, the first question is what terms should we use for the comparison?","There are a lot terms Twitter users use to reference Jesus: there's the broad \"Jesus,\" which includes other people named Jesus, the more specific \"Jesus Christ\" and foreign language versions -- Jesucristo in Spanish, gesu\u0300 cristo in Italian. Some users also tag the name, resulting in mentions for @Jesus.","There are a lot fewer version of \"Kanye.\" \"Kanye,\" which includes other people named Kanye (though there are far less people named Kanye than Jesus), \"Kanye West\" and @kanyewest. (There are also nominal instances of people tweeting his nicknames, like Yeezy and 'Ye.)","Since Jesus doesn't have a genuine Twitter account, and Kanye has a habit of deleting all of his tweets, using @ mentions didn't seem that promising or fair. Looking to minimize instances of other people named Jesus and Kanye, we decided to start our search comparing \"Kanye West\" with \"Jesus Christ\":","According to the data, in the last year worldwide, looking at only original Tweets (no retweets, no replies), \"Jesus Christ\" had 3,936,585 mentions, while \"Kanye West\" had 4,541,349 mentions. Pretty impressive for the 36-year-old rapper.","While West's total was greater overall, on a typical day, Kanye didn't have more tweets than Jesus. Kanye's numbers were skewed by a few high mention days and his median tweets\/day (9,981) were, in fact, lower than Jesus's median tweets\/day (10,458). In fact, Jesus had more tweets on the majority of days (187 out of the 365 days in the year).","So, using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" their Twitter mentions are pretty close.","But what about the foreign language tweets? Kanye has an advantage with foreign language tweets, because countries with the Latin derived alphabets, as far as we know, refer to Kanye West as Kanye West while, as mentioned above, there are many different ways to reference Jesus.","Only looking at the United States offers a clearer picture. Although there are some residents in the U.S. who speak foreign languages, Jesus Christ is generally used as the identifier. Here, again using \"Kanye West\" vs \"Jesus Christ,\" Kanye had slightly more mentions overall, 2,429,931 to 2,224,895, but they were about equal when the day-to-day totals received consideration. Breaking it down state-by-state, some states tweeted more about Jesus (orange states) while other states tweeted more about Kanye (green states).","When did users tweet the most about Jesus and Kanye?","Kanye West's top five days:","1) 8\/26\/2013, 90,993 tweets. The day after his \"Blood on the Leaves\" performance at the VMAs","2) 12\/31\/2012, 70,701 tweets. New Years Eve. Kim Kardashian announces she's pregnant with West's baby.","3) 9\/27\/2013, 58,608 tweets. West feuds with Kimmel on Twitter and gets in a confrontation with paparazzi.","4) 6\/18\/2013, 51,012 tweets. The official release of his album \"Yeezus.\"","5) 6\/21\/2013, 48192. The announcement of his baby's name: North West.","Jesus Christ's top five days:","1) 12\/25\/2012, 37,459 tweets: Christmas.","2) 5\/9\/2013, 36,393 tweets: Ascension Thursday","3) 3\/31\/2013, 35,955 tweets: Easter Sunday","4) 3\/29\/2013, 29,576 tweets: Good Friday","5) 4\/23\/2013, 26,921 tweets: St. George's Day","Jesus Christ's biggest day-of-the-week was Sunday, while Kanye's biggest day-of-the-week was Monday.","When you look at the stream of \"Jesus Christ\" tweets, you will quickly notice a complication: a large amount of the \"Jesus Christ\" tweets are idiomatic (\"I just stubbed my toe. Jesus Christ! #notblessed\") and don't actually refer to the literal Jesus Christ. Usage of the exclamatory \"Jesus Christ\" is probably more popular among those who are at least exposed to Christianity, so it may still be a good signal for Jesus's popularity among the Twitterati. That being said, the idiomatic Jesus Christ doesn't directly refer to the person Jesus Christ, while Kanye West refers to the person Kanye in almost all cases, so if we're looking for an apples-to-apples comparison, then Jesus Christ's numbers are significantly smaller.","How much smaller? We looked at a sample of the hundred most recent tweets for \"Jesus Christ\" on Twitter using the Twitter search and found that 73 percent of uses of \"Jesus Christ\" were idiomatic, leaving 27 percent literal. This search occurred during a tense soccer match (lots of \"Jesus Christ\" exclamations) and is too small of a sample to offer definitive conclusions, but it signals that the idiomatic \"Jesus Christ\" is accounting for a significant portion of the examined mentions.","So what happens if you compare \"Jesus\" vs \"Kanye\"? Jesus had significantly more tweets: Kanye had 10,412,097 tweets compared to Jesus's 51,724,902 tweets. Looking again at a sample of the hundred latest tweets to gauge what's going on, we see the following breakdown:","Idiomatic: 22%","Literal: 70%","Other Person's Name: 8%","This sample is again too small to prove definitive, but even if only 25 percent of those tweets that contain the word Jesus refer to the religious figure, \"Jesus\" would still have more literal tweets than \"Kanye,\" and the proportion of tweets referring to Jesus appears to be much higher than that. We also haven't accounted for different names for Jesus in languages other than English. When you break it down by region, mentions of \"Jesus\" are more popular than \"Kanye\" pretty much everywhere.","So, it looks like Jesus is \"the most high\" on Twitter -- except for Justin Bieber, who trumps Jesus in popularity with 68,257,710 tweets for the search term \"Bieber\" during the same period."],"targetTitle":"Is 'Kanye West' More Popular Than 'Jesus Christ'?","targetDescription":"Kanye West has used Jesus Christ in his art since \"Jesus Walks.\" Never, thou...","targetKeywords":"kanye west yeezus tour,kanye west yeezus,twitter,Kanye West,Jesus Christ,yeezus,topsy","targetMedia":["http:\/\/big.assets.huffingtonpost.com\/kanyejesusmosthigh_1.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/221717\/slide_221717_3826322_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/big.assets.huffingtonpost.com\/kanyejesus6-1.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/oimg?key=0AozQZhVO6XiydDVnZG02T0FoTUxheWpDMlRaQWp4N3c&oid=1&zx=et9vnjz6b5ie","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1439506\/images\/o-KANYE-WEST-facebook.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1aOFRT8","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Twitter depending on metric used","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["original Tweets"],"spoilerPositions":[[[6,67],[6,82]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":306}

We all remember happy faces, exhilaration, and sheer elation when two folks mutually get into a relationship, but half of them get thrown in predicament, simply because of infinitely. ","Why do you ask?","Because some people just love to cheat and it can happen for multiple reasons - they found a better match, they just weren't loyal, the opportunity of something different, emotional incompatibility, intimacy, etc. ","But sadly, despite cheating, most cheaters feel belaboured when caught. ","But let's keep the mental rationale aside and see what science has to say about it. We\u2019ve all heard the same, tired cliche about infidelity: \"Once a cheater, always a cheater.\" and now science is backing it.","A recent study proves that cheating is not a one-time thing, and that person will probably cheat on you again.","The venerable saying is backed in this journal titled \"The brain adapts to dishonesty\". ","The study focused on the part of the brain called amygdala, which is the supplier of negative responses. It's a region that's associated with emotions and plays \"a key role in signalling, processing and assessing arousal.\" It further responds to an individual when they lie. ","Each time a person is caught cheating, the response to their wrongdoing is reduced.","\"We speculate that the blunted response to repeated acts of dishonesty may reflect a reduction in the emotional response to these decisions or to their affective assessment and saliency,\" the paper reads.","It further stated that the brain rationalises with the cheating ways, and feels less guilty, responsible when caught. How convenient, right?","\"When participants were dishonest for the benefit of someone else, dishonesty at a constant rate was observed,\" the study says.","When a person engages in dishonesty purely for the benefit of another it may be perceived as morally acceptable.","In all this, the person on the receiving end should always be open-minded -- open to options, positivity, optimism.

He went on to be a part of Britain's National Diving Squad for 12 years, and even represented England at the 1990 Commonwealth Games.","Eventually he was picked up by an agency called Sports Promotions which specialised in sports modelling, before he became a model for French Connection.","All of that, grouped with his many action roles, most of which he performs his own stunts for, have required him to stay in great shape. But how's he maintained it for all of these years?","Statham ripped as fuck in Death Race. Credit: Universal Pictures","Well, the 49-year-old, who has studied Wing Chun, kung fu, karate, and kickboxing, applies himself to a strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime. And by strict, I mean fucking strict; this is Jason Statham we're talking about, he's a no nonsense kind of bloke.","Statham only eats 'good food', saying 95% of what he eats is clean - the other 5% being small treats every now and again. He also swears by cutting out all the sugars and heavy starch in the afternoon. If you eat carbs later in the day, it's harder to work off - if needs be, have them in the morning and your daily activities should work off the calories.","In an interview with Men's Health, the star revealed that for breakfast he goes for either granola, fresh fruits and oats, porridge, or poached eggs.","For lunch, he says in the interview to broaden your horizons, but fair warning, it's not going to sound too appealing.","\"I'm certainly no vegan, but there's this little place down on Sunset that I'll go to, the California Vegan, and they do a really good steamed vegetable and brown rice,\" he said. \"You put that in your body and you feel good. Or try a nice miso soup. There's nothing better than that stuff.\"","He goes on to say that the latest you should ever have your evening meal is 7pm, and it should be high in protein. He specifies chicken, fish and lean beef, accompanied by vegetables or salad. The icing on the cake, as well, is to drink a minimum of three litres of water a day; he has knocked fruit juices, full of added sugar and fructose on the head, as well as alcohol.","So, unfortunately, you're not going to get as stacked as The Transporter star while chugging lagers every other day of the week, and then ending the night with a sweaty kebab.","Jason's workout plan is a different kettle of fish. The martial arts expert believes in never repeating the same workout as he feels you see more results from varying your exercises. Therefore it's hard to pinpoint a solid plan.","http:\/\/lions.gt\/mechanictrailer","A photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on Jul 3, 2016 at 5:10am PDT","A photo posted by Jason Statham (@jasonstatham) on","According to BodyBuilding.com, the 49-year-old has two rules when it comes to hitting the gym: 1) \"Never repeat a workout - it is virtually impossible to go through a training plan without repeating the exercises but each and every workout would be varied.","2) \"Take notes of everything - as you progress through the workouts, it is inevitable that you will get fitter, faster and stronger. Therefore, it is vital to a successful plan to record all lifts and times so that intensities can be calculated.\"","Whatever workout he chooses to do, he will do a five to 10 minute general warm-up, which will be him using an elliptical machine (cross fit trainer), or something else that works the whole body.","He told BodyBuilding.com that following this warm-up, he does another 10 minutes of medium intensity exercises. This will include the likes of front squats, dead-lifts, exercises carrying kettle bells, sandbags or dumbbells, a variety of explosive medicine ball exercises, and circuit training.","The Snatch star has a specific non-iron circuit training regime, too, which requires no equipment. He told Men's Health that he picks five exercises from exploding push-ups, squat thrust, burpees, sit-ups or crunches, step-ups, tuck jumps, squat jumps, star jumps or pull-ups, and does 10 reps of each. Anyone else out of breath just thinking about this?","Statham's high intensity boxing workout begins with shadow boxing, working the back and shoulder, with lunges and some quad, groin, and hamstring stretching in between to work the legs.","He then moves onto five three minute rounds on the pads, and once that is completed, steps it up to three, three minute rounds on a heavy bag. The workout is then finished off with three rounds on the speed bag and a warm down.","For a weight based high intensity workout, Statham's trainer will choose a combination of six exercises, set a required rep range for each individual exercise, and then repeat five times.","The time taken to complete the five circuits is recorded, and is how the level of intensity is measured. The times are then turned into targets so they can be used to increase the intensity of the workout as fitness levels increase.","Of the exercises, BodyBuilding.com says they include barbell front raises, dumbbell burpees, farmer's walk, pull-ups, bear crawl sled drag, close-grip pull downs, front squats, hanging knee raises, weighted step ups, and one-arm cable rows.","No wonder he's fucking jacked.","Words by Mark McGowan"],"targetTitle":"How Jason Statham Has Managed To Stay Ripped All These Years","targetDescription":"The actor turns 49 today.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/0bd05e2257d6beb8f2679f601975928b.jpg","http:\/\/www.theladbible.com\/assets\/images\/instagram.svg","http:\/\/www.theladbible.com\/assets\/images\/vine-logo.svg","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/491x276\/477318d85797b246990e79ef3a24df8c.png","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/f16c01d05797b7ecec5989a98093bb69.png","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/4542b7875797e1f467e753f19c6ab6e6.jpg","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/e4bb4be557978989990e183e5f1f8a44.jpg","http:\/\/www.theladbible.com\/assets\/images\/snapchat.svg","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/68a114a357d60f196cb18b88d01b2341.jpg","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/4e58d1485797d24e93bd3e192d4c26d6.jpg","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/7f0474a257d5989d74dd48410aabb28b.jpg","http:\/\/www.theladbible.com\/assets\/images\/theme\/logo.svg","https:\/\/d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net\/atrk.gif?account=jzgkj1aAkN00Ej","http:\/\/20.theladbiblegroup.com\/s3\/content\/353x199\/409f8d1457975234990ecf8591cc625d.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.theladbible.com\/entertainment\/celebrity-how-jason-statham-has-managed-to-stay-ripped-all-these-years-20160726","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Exercise and a good diet","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["strict diet, as well as a strict workout regime"],"spoilerPositions":[[[10,104],[10,151]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":312}

That is until For decades rumors of the singer\u2019s sexuality swirled, even as he filled arenas and his records sold millions of copies worldwide. That is until Univision reporter Fernando del Rinco\u0301n asked Juan Gabriel point blank if he was gay during a televised interview in the early 2000s.","The journalist first quoted a Mexican historian who had commented on how the artist \"explored the feminine side\" when on stage. Juan Gabriel responded saying, \"Art is feminine... Look, if you\u2019re handsome and young and beautiful, well, people are always going to say that you\u2019re gay.\"","When del Rinco\u0301n asked if the singer was gay, Juan Gabriel laughed and questioned why he was so interested. Then he gave a simple answer: \"They say that what you can see you don\u2019t ask, son.\"","When the journalist said that what he saw was a successful singer. The artist responded with a perfect analysis of what truly matters:","That\u2019s what\u2019s most important because your worth isn\u2019t based on the things that other people can hold against you. Because everything that one does is what stays, what matters. Actions are what\u2019s more important. To transcend and be yourself. People are smart, they\u2019re not dumb... I have no reason to tell you, and others, something that is not of interest to you. I think I am an artist. I think I am Juan Gabriel, who has given so much with my songs. And I\u2019m going to tell you something, Fernando, I\u2019m not a saint but I\u2019m also not the little devil that many think I am or that people want to make others think I am. They say we\u2019re living difficult times, that people are curious and they want to know more, but people also aren\u2019t dumb.","Juan Gabriel then went on to criticize television for trying to delve into something that shouldn\u2019t be of interest to anyone.","\"I think, today, television is asking too many loaded questions, pushing further for the ratings,\" he told the journalist. \"I\u2019ve learned during my life that if I am in hell, I make my own glory. I\u2019ve also been in glory and perhaps I\u2019ve made my own hell, but I certainly don\u2019t take anyone down with me. And [I\u2019ve learned] that I am not a liar.

But there\u2019s something else I have to say as a human being, and that\u2019s that you only get one life and you have to live it, and if we have to eventually pass to a better life then it has be an honest one.

{"postId":"819113738901004288","postText":["This bot has saved users $250 million, and it's coming to Facebook messenger"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Late last year, just in time for Christmas shopping, Rachel Rhoads got a nice surprise. One of her secret savings accounts had grown to $900 behind her back.","Rhoads, a 37-year-old Los Angeles-based sales director for a jewelry line, has an account with Digit, a financial technology company with an algorithm that tracks users\u2019 income and spending patterns. It painlessly spirits small amounts of money out of checking and into a savings account every two or three days. ","\"I just thought it was such a good idea, to set it and forget it,\" said Rhoads, who says she is \"like a squirrel\" in her approach to saving. Digit sends texts with balance updates, which she largely ignores because \"I like to pretend the saving is not happening.\" ","Getting consumers comfortable with putting their finances on customized autopilot, starting with a simple, no-fee\u2014and no-interest\u2014savings account, is the San Francisco startup\u2019s mission. In two years, its users have saved more than $350 million this way, according to its 31-year-old founder and chief executive officer, Ethan Bloch. When the product moved out of pilot mode, in February 2015, users were saving about $1 million a month; now that\u2019s more than $35 million a month. Digit won\u2019t disclose the size of its user base but says it has tripled from about a year ago.","Digit had a savings bot before bots were cool, or at least before the hype in the financial technology world reached a fever pitch. Its product is simple. An algorithm looks at a user\u2019s average, high, and low checking account balance, when the user is paid, and whether the pay cycle is smooth or choppy. Then, after looking for bills due in the next week or two and analyzing recent spending, it moves an amount it judges the customer won\u2019t miss to a savings account. The company makes money from the interest rate it gets on account assets.","Digit announced today that it will be the first savings bot on Facebook Messenger\u2019s platform, so users can just use Facebook to communicate with it. When Digit moved out of its pilot phase, it communicated only by text, a natural language for many users, since 17 percent of them are aged 21 to 24, and 44 percent are from 25 to 34 years old. Rhoads said they\u2019re \"cute texts\" with \"some personality\" and \"not annoying at all.\" After text messaging came iOS and Android apps for users.","The company is now working on what Bloch called \"the first artificial intelligence-powered financial goal program.\" Users would set a date and amount (and pick an emoji, of course), and Digit\u2019s algorithm would make a series of projections based on balances to determine the optimal amount needed to start saving toward that goal\u2014or point out that the goal is unrealistic.","Also on the product horizon is having Digit\u2019s algorithm figure out how to \"move every dollar where it should go, at the right time, to minimize fees [on student loans, credit card  accounts, etc.] and maximize gain,\" Bloch said. ","There are hitches. Since Digit isn\u2019t a bank, it can\u2019t pay interest, and it will be competing in an environment of rising rates. Bloch said interest rates \"are not a huge deal\" for his customers, because they regularly withdraw money and tend to save small sums.","Another hurdle is that traditional bank technology can make it hard to connect accounts. \"Banks have not made it easy for customers to get their data,\" Bloch said. \"Because of that, Digit and products like Acorns, Venmo, Betterment\u2014every day we have bank difficulties that affect thousands of customers.\"","Behavioral finance underlies much of Digit\u2019s design. Take the goal function, for example: If users get more specific about what they are saving for, research suggests, they are less likely to withdraw the money.","\"If an account is labeled 'Charlie\u2019s Education Fund,' I\u2019ll think harder about withdrawing it than if it\u2019s just labeled 'Savings,'\" Bloch said. Currently, 70 percent of Digit users withdraw 80 percent of their savings every 90 days, mainly to pay bills and meet short-term needs for cash, to pay off debt, or pay for travel.","Bloch's broadest long-term goal is to make Digit\u2019s user interface far more conversational, to \"humanize it\" so users feel more in control when they communicate with it.","\"We want to make Digit understand more\u2014not as broad as Alexa or Siri, but widen the aperture a little more\u2014related to finances and your money,\" he said. \"One day, it would be awesome to say, \u2018Hey, Digit, am I OK for retirement?\u2019 And all Digit does is send back a thumbs-up emoji.\"","That kind of complex analysis won\u2019t show up anytime soon. But after a Series B round of fundraising led by venture capital firm Ribbit Capital, Digit\u2019s 22-person team is sitting on $25 million in cash. That, Bloch said, will let the company \"be somewhat protected for the next few years in pushing the envelope, largely to invest in product development. The big question for us now is, what more will our customers trust Digit to do?\" (Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)","(Updates amount of monthly savings of digit users and total amount of savings.)"],"targetTitle":"A Siri for Your Finances?

The bill would allocate $19.5 billion in funds to NASA in 2017, but it has a critical mission for the space agency: send men to Mars.","Funds Are On The Way","It looks like Republican and Democratic senators alike are keen on safeguarding America\u2019s space programs. With the potential chaos of a new president on the horizon, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation passed a bipartisan bill giving NASA $19.5 billion to continue working on a mission to Mars. It also includes support for the continuation of the program to send astronauts on private rockets to the International Space Station (ISS) from American soil no later than 2018.","\"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration \u2013 that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, \"We have seen in the past the importance of stability and predictability in NASA and space exploration \u2013 that whenever one has a change in administration, we have seen the chaos that can be caused by the cancellation of major programs,\" Republican Senator Ted Cruz, lead sponsor of the bill, commented . \"The impact in terms of jobs lost, the impact in terms of money wasted has been significant.\"","The NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2016 includes an overall authorization level of $19.508 billion for fiscal year 2017, but it still needs to be passed by the Senate as a whole, of course. The budget allotted is the same as what was approved by House appropriators and a bit more than the version released by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The Obama administration, likewise, proposed $19 billion in funding for NASA.","Credits: NASA","Making it rain, NASA-style","The Senate is not giving NASA money just for the sake of exploration. It is also a challenge, a mandate, actually. The bill requires that NASA make it an official goal to send crewed missions to Mars in the next 25 years.","The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap The bill allocates funds for different components: $4.5 billion on exploration, nearly $5 billion for space operations, and $5.4 billion for science. It also does not scrap NASA\u2019s controversial plans to send men on asteroids and collect samples by 2021. It does, however, require the space agency to regularly send progress reports to Congress, justifying its $1.4 billion cost.","\"Fifty-five years after President Kennedy challenged the nation to put a man on the moon, the Senate is challenging NASA to put humans on Mars. The priorities that we\u2019ve laid out for NASA in this bill mark the beginning of a new era of American spaceflight,\" said an optimistic Florida Sen.

In fact, Lynyrd Skynyrd played a huge role in the success of another iconic band as they made their rise to fame; Los Angeles rockers Guns N\u2019Roses, who thanks to these Jacksonville natives, achieved critical acclaim with their smash hit \"Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\" from 1987\u2019s Appetite For Destruction \u2013 but how?","According to Guns N\u2019 Roses frontman Axl Rose, \"Sweet Child O\u2019 Mine\" was directly inspired by Lynyrd Skynyrd; when crafting the song\u2019s nostalgic, strangely romantic feel, Axl turned to Jacksonville\u2019s finest for a lesson in how to write straight from the heart and make it mean not just something, but everything:","\"For \u2018Sweet Child\u2019... I went out and got some old Skynyrd tapes to make sure that we\u2019d got that heartfelt feeling,\" reveals Rose.","We\u2019ve been fans of Lynyrd Skynyrd for decades, and we\u2019re always amazed at how far their influence stretches! Always setting the bar high for themselves and for future generations of bands with each album and each performance, the way that Skynyrd has shaped the way rock music is made is possibly one of the greatest parts of the legacy they forged on that baseball diamond a lifetime ago. Whether Ronnie Van Zant would have liked Guns N\u2019Roses, we\u2019ll never know \u2013 but somehow, we think he\u2019d be mighty pleased to know that the legacy he helped build is positively impacting the music world and inspiring artists to stretch themselves to achieve something great!"],"targetTitle":"29 Years Ago, Lynyrd Skynyrd Inspired THIS Band\u2019s Biggest Hit \u2013 You Won\u2019t Believe Who It Is!","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/d70e954d2f2f6d64aef7453702e5cf8bcb59e410.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/d5d500d5fc7a2f092e2350d1ab01992dea7417a6.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/384839c5c83368a85894feac8d0deebb58514000.png","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAAAYFBMVEUAAAD\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/98JRy6AAAAH3RSTlMA8PwB\/iHFXDT14frmdqsbMqj46CkU2e6g+37e\/eseQ0l9HQAAAFtJREFUeNqVzUcKwDAMRFG5pffe5\/63DI6xsQNZZHb\/IRB9L2rDFjnGAGJA+Z2kyITXdQGU5K3Cs7nRwcCoM9APGgCQNDCRBW5gcbAa2F4XXDnYcUjgvMh++bMbX5wJSDyqfBcAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/370517b2d1b870dccab46be24884fb9f615ff83d.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/6d37ad8f339c7cd39ccc63800c35b4db2dbb3912.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/310a4ab816c5f35faddfc10e3393213a4aac16c0.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/214486f826fcaaf9d64a172bebf04e5d34db8628.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/1623bc0593944df7603ab3b97612591715e1c776.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/83fec6f3df3e089197c4ba90050d9344ec3193ae.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/89b7f51f55bf31e0cc894838ae96fc8de81912ee.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/a37f88fd2cd10e67a319ff734980dfb75fb5f9f3.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/0636ba101371d39fff91b63d28192acb8c90f091.png","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/\/\/\/\/yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/689241d8ad821d516f97232c9fc942e30ce2aaf2.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/d548c68c4f84666b25e79032a9a1a5c4a9c6aa4e.png","data:image\/png;base64,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","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAID\/AP\/\/\/wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs=","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/8976b34c3d2ffe4be3475feff165cc2051bd215b.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/0f4c7b4aefe8034ef554d02b056d274832d6f0bf\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b\/a38c93dfc6ff3c65fadc238e4f61bac0f4d205a2.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/M2B1b","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Guns N'Roses, \"Sweet Child O' Mine\"","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["Guns N\u2019 Roses"],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,13],[3,26]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":321}

And oddsmakers are pretty convinced at this point that it's going to come down to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.","Trump is given a 71% chance of winning the Republican nomination, says the Election Betting Odds website. (Using data from online casino betfair.com , the site averages the current \"bid\" and \"ask\" prices to come up with the implied odds.)","Clinton is given an 87% chance of sealing the Democratic nomination by the site.","She also is favored to win the general election by 55%.","But what about the polls?","That's certainly better odds than either candidate is seeing in national political polls. An average of six polls from news organizations on Real Clear Politics shows Trump leading the Republican field with 33.2%. And among Democrats, Clinton, with 47.2% is just five points ahead of Bernie Sanders.","There is, of course, a difference between polls and casino odds. One actively and methodically solicits the opinions of registered voters. The other is determined purely by gambler gut instinct.","So, while you may want to take the casino odds with a grain of salt, it's worth noting that betfair isn't the only online gambling site that's predicting a strong Trump showing in the primary -- with Clinton winning a narrow victory.","PaddyPower.com currently gives Trump 5\/2 odds for winning the presidency. Clinton is still the frontrunner, with 8\/11 odds. (Marco Rubio has 6\/1 odds on that site, while Sanders is far back at 12\/1.)","Put in real world dollars, that means if you were to bet $100 on Clinton and she won, you'd see returns of $172.73. Take the odds for Trump and that $100 would become $350.","Big bets on Clinton","OddsShark, meanwhile, says data from Bovada indicates you might be better served to just hold onto your money if you're considering getting some skin in the political game. The odds for Clinton winning the Democratic nomination are so overwhelming that a $100 bet would just earn you an extra $10 and that same bet on Trump to take the Republican nomination would pocket you just $25 more.","Should those two face off in November?

Here's how she's investing in 2017:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In 2016, JP Livingston celebrated her 28th birthday. She also retired. Last month, I spoke with her about how she was able to retire, despite the fact that she only graduated from college about seven years ago. JP (a pen name she goes by on her blog, TheMoneyHabit.org) was able to retire because of her high earnings, lofty savings goals and disciplined investment techniques. Her investment strategies are part of what allowed her to build a net worth of about $2.25 million. ","With less than a week left in the year, so many of us are setting goals for the new year, which includes figuring out an investment plan for 2017. Deciding on investment strategies or goals can help us figure out what we want our long-term financial picture to look like, and shape our budget for the coming year. When laying out an investing plan, who better to learn from than a woman whose investments boast high returns, and who retired before 30? In our Q&A, JP discusses her personal 2017 investment plan, and provides useful insights for investors looking to build their nest egg more aggressively. This interview has been edited for brevity.","Maya Kachroo-Levine: You've had investments of over $1 million yield a 13% return ($130,000) in just one year. Can you speak to your investment strategy that year, and can you walk us through your 2016 investment strategy?","JP Livingston: My investment strategy for several years has been a twist on a broadly discussed strategy to go long on equities.","Many financial experts (those who aren't compensated for getting you to invest a certain way) will tell you that if you are young and in the wealth accumulation phase of your life, to consider parking your money in a low-cost index fund, for example, Vanguard's Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX).","There are a few key arguments for this strategy. First, it's a nice hedge against inflation because the companies in the index are presumably raising their prices with inflation; since companies are valued on a multiple of revenue or profit, this will be captured in the growth of the stock market.","Secondly, and most importantly, is that it's hard to argue with its results. The compound annual growth rate for stocks on the S&P Index for the last 30 years has been 11%. There are very few if any opportunities available to us regular individual investors that can top that kind of return for the risk. (Note: you'll get an entirely different view from hedge funds or mutual funds. They believe they can beat market returns and so they charge high fees for their time and efforts. A few of them are worth it. Most of them are not).","Kachroo-Levine: What are you planning on changing about your strategy in 2017?","Livingston: As a retiree, steady cash flow is going to matter more to me than it has in the past. There are only two ways to make money: appreciation and income. Stocks, for example, are about appreciation you make very little money on a regular basis (usually a puny 1%-2% in dividends), but a year or two or three later, you can sell it for much more than you paid and pocket the difference. A heavily appreciation-based strategy, like going 100% into index funds, will no longer meet my needs.","Income-based strategies, by contrast, put a steady paycheck in the spotlight. Bonds are generally purchased for the interest they provide. Sure they can appreciate or depreciate in value, but the bulk of your return from a bond comes from the monthly or quarterly dividend it pays.","I have a few years to build myself an income-based strategy, as I still have some deferred compensation coming from my old employer, but I'm looking to add one or two rental properties to my portfolio in 2017. Interest rates are still fairly low so it's not a bad time to be a borrower. I would also look at adding more bonds to my portfolio (specifically leveraged municipal bond funds; the leverage juices returns and municipal bonds are tax exempt), but I do not want to buy bonds right now, as the Fed has signaled a plan to increase interest rates (and even raised them just a week ago).","Kachroo-Levine: What are your financial\/investment goals for 2017? What are your priorities?","Livingston: As I am newly retired, my main priority is transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year. I'm on the lookout for a rental property or two to take advantage of low interest rates and which will provide some much-needed steady income. In some parts of the country like San Francisco, rental properties are actually negative cash flow exercises and are predicated on appreciation. In some areas, it will throw off 6%-7% or more in income each year and fit my income needs. Real estate is hyperlocal like that.","Kachroo-Levine: What are the key philosophies that help shape your investment strategy?","Livingston: I feel I've gotten pretty far on just two things.First, don't be afraid to say you don't know.","People get really weird and insecure when it comes to money. We're all lifelong learners. I have to admit I don't know basic things all the time. For example, while I've read quite a bit about real estate investment, I'm constantly finding myself with a giant question mark as I apply those concepts to my first live investments. My priority though is to make money and learn, not to impress people.","Second: Don't give up until you really feel you understand something.  Finally, my other silver bullet question is to ask What are the arguments against it? or What are the three things that could break this strategy? There's no free lunch. Every strategy has some vulnerability.","Kachroo-Levine: What advice can you offer for novice investors in 2017? Specifically, if you were speaking to people who had never invested beyond a 401(k) or IRA, what would you say to them?","Livingston: You are in such an exciting place, because there is low-hanging fruit all around you. A few things:","1. Money management is an incremental game, not a winner-take-all game. That means every tweak you make has a noticeable impact on your money, and it means you don't have to choose between going whole hog or absolute zero. You can devote however much time and effort you have and get proportional results and new ideas to employ.","2. Momentum matters most. Start by joining a few interesting communities and blogs and read a little bit a few times a week. Cruise around on the Reddit Personal Finance forum. Investment is only painful or boring when you try to cram too much too fast, or you go find a dry, educational source and force feed yourself the information.","Momentum is the most important piece when you start any new project. Too many people think Alright, it's time to do this investment stuff and go and buy some highly rated book on Amazon to start their education. That's such a self-defeating way to start. Is that how you got into skiing, or guitar or interpretive Celtic dance? Has that kind of textbook strategy ever succeeded in firing up your passion?","Kachroo-Levine: For those seeking early retirement, can you share why your investments are so crucial to your early retirement journey?","Livingston: Your nest egg is like an entire extra employee doing work for you, an employee that gets better and stronger and eventually eclipses you.","Say you make $100,000 pre-tax and save $30,000 a year. Once your nest egg is three times your salary, or $300,000, at a 10% return it will generate as much as you slaving a whole year to put away has accomplished.","At 10-times your salary and a 10% return, it is throwing off more money than you make in an entire year. You could be sitting on the beach drinking Mai Tais and still see a year's worth of salary come in just from your investments. Of course, you can't guarantee consistent 10% returns, but you have a long-term bet that you can achieve during your accumulation phase by investing in low-cost index funds.","More on Forbes: "],"targetTitle":"How A 28-Year-Old Who Retired With A $2 Million Net Worth Is Investing In 2017","targetDescription":"Check out exactly what her investing strategy looks like.","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["transitioning my portfolio into more income-based opportunities that can provide steady money to cover my expenses each year"],"spoilerPositions":[[[12,55],[12,179]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":326}

In these videos, the kitties are usually eating, and their owners surreptitiously sneak up behind them, place the vegetable down, and wait for their pet to turn around.","According to IFLScience, the cats\u2019 fearful reactions\u2014which include jumping, running, or pawing at the long green vegetable\u2014are likely due to the surprise element of having an unexpected object placed into their territory without notice. In short, you could likely replicate the experiment with any other vegetable.

K. Rowling. How did it work having three writers in the mix?","John Tiffany Jo Rowling was incredibly generous. I met her first, and I already had a soft spot for her because she used to write in the cafe of the Traverse Theater in Edinburgh when I was the director. It was only after the first book came out that I realized it had been her, nursing one cappuccino for four hours. When we met to talk about the play, she asked, \"What do you think the Harry Potter stories are about?\" I said, \"Learning to deal with death and grief.\" There was something in her eye \u2014 I thought, we didn\u2019t say it\u2019s about transformation or magic or flying on brooms, and we\u2019re on the right track.","Thorne We all met in Edinburgh and as the day developed, we knew we would take the epilogue of \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" as a starting point.","Tiffany All the seeds are there; we start with that scene in the train station. Am I allowed to say that? Anyway, it was clear that she was going to let us take those characters and have our own ideas.","Callender Of course, Jack came to the table with an encyclopedic knowledge of Harry, so that helped.","Thorne All right, I\u2019m a nerd. With abandonment issues.","Did you really sketch out the whole arc of the story in that first meeting?","Thorne Yes, but then it took about six months to really map the whole thing out. Every time it was like taking a big step forward, one or two small ones back. Jo would say, \"This feels right, this doesn\u2019t.\"","Tiffany There are parts of the story, which when we first conceived them, I didn\u2019t think she would let us do, but she never hesitated. It is one thing to let us continue the story, another to let us unravel the canon.","Friedman That\u2019s enough!","Was the idea of a two-part play there from the beginning?","Tiffany No, not at all. But we knew we had to deal with going beyond where the books left off, but also go back and look at the stories within them. We wanted to develop the characters that are already known and keep that consistency, but also introduce new ones. It was clearly hard to put an epic tale into two-and-a-half hours. We had a meeting and said, \"Why not two parts?\" And we knew right away how we wanted to end the first part. It\u2019s a cliffhanger.","Noma Dumezweni It does that wonderful thing that books do when they work; it makes you desperate for more story.","How is it different telling that story as a play rather than a novel?","Thorne We can tell the story of the younger and older generation at the same time, which the books didn\u2019t do. The exciting thing has been working out how those worlds fit together. It\u2019s a coming-of-age story as much for the adults as for the children. John and I are more or less the same age as Harry in the play and I just had my first child, so there has been a lot of discussion about growing up, being a parent.","Tiffany How do you mother or father when you still need parenting yourself?","Dumezweni Also, I think the difference with a play is that you\u2019re not experiencing the story on your own the way you do with a book. Being in the theater is a communal experience, and this play, with two parts, is a commitment. I\u2019m fascinated to see what my daughter will think after a whole day in the theater. As an actor, it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never experienced before.","What about dealing with the issue of magic in the theater, where you can\u2019t create the kind of effects that happen in film?","Tiffany Film has got green screen. We\u2019ve got the imagination of the audience.","How do you feel, Jamie and Noma, playing characters that a huge fan-base feel so possessive about? Is it intimidating?","Dumezweni I think Jamie found it very intimidating. [Everyone laughs.]","Parker It\u2019s not so different from playing any role that is within a canon. You have the responsibility of being sensitive to the collective investment in the story. But you just have to try to serve the play the best way you can and not worry about that.","Dumezweni The weight of expectation is huge. But for me that pressure has been outweighed by getting text messages from mums I know saying how huge it is for their mixed-race daughters that I am playing Hermione. Ultimately it\u2019s a theater piece, I\u2019m a theater actor and doing a job as best I can.","Has it been difficult to work under conditions of intense secrecy? And what about when previews start and people are talking about the play online?","Callender I\u2019m hopeful after seeing how people were about \"Star Wars.\" They mostly protected the fans.","Tiffany It will be a relief when the text is published, when the play officially opens on July 30, so that it\u2019s not our secret to keep. But if you don\u2019t read it, and you choose not to read reviews, we\u2019ve made it possible to come without prior knowledge.","Parker And you don\u2019t get that much nowadays. So often things are ruined because you know so much.","Dumezweni I\u2019ve quite loved the secrecy. Although, of course, my home life is [expletive]. My daughter tries to guess what is in the play. She says, \"Just smile at me if I\u2019m right.\"","Tiffany My mum is the only problem. Everyone else is fine.

Although nicotine addiction is considered one of the strongest addictions, even more addictive than cocaine, the good news is that the physical side of things doesn't last very long. In fact, some believe that you will lose the physical cravings for nicotine in as little as 3 days.","The real struggle for smokers is overcoming the mental addiction. The smoker has essentially trained their subconscious mind to make smoking an \u0093automatic\u0094 behavior. These are the habits and rituals that a smoker has developed over the years such as smoking when they wake up, just before they go to sleep, after they eat, when they drive, when they drink coffee or alcohol, and so on.","How Hypnotherapy Helps You Quit","So what will hypnotherapy do? Rather than just treating the physical urges that are part of your smoking habit, hypnotherapy targets the subconscious drive behind the addiction, and breaks the positive associations with cigarettes that the mind has formed. This is replaced by an empowering, smoke-free perspective the hypnotist offers through verbal suggestions that deem smoking as something undesirable \u0096 or unnecessary \u0096 to do. Gradually, these suggestions take hold and diminish the smoker's impulse to smoke. Furthermore, hypnotherapy is considered to be a far more safe and natural method to quit smoking with and is non-habit forming. This cannot be said about most of the stop smoking aids we currently have on the market.","But going to a hypnotist can be expensive. As much as $200 per one hour session, and requiring as many as 5 sessions for the entire treatment. If you're a celebrity like the ones mentioned earlier, then this isn't a problem. But can the average smoker afford to go to a hypnotherapist? Well, that question is left to the individual, but consider that a pack a day smoker will spend in excess of $2000 a year on cigarettes, not even including the increased cost of life and health insurance, and doesn't include the drastic cut in your ability to earn."],"targetTitle":"What is the easiest way to quit smoking?","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/ads.jpg","http:\/\/bttrack.com\/Pixel\/Retarget\/324","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/call-to-action2.png","http:\/\/bat.bing.com\/action\/0?ti=5441966&Ver=2","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/small-1.jpg","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/ybtlogo.png","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/ps10_2.jpg","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/ps10_1.jpg","http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/images\/smoke1019062015.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.yourbettertomorrow.com\/presale\/easiest-way-to-stop-smoking-10.php?eid=Mjg=&amp;var1=yav&amp;var2=[var2]&amp;var3=[var3]&amp;eid=11&amp;vid=55920240","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Be a rich celebrity.","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["Hypnosis"],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,155],[3,163]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":330}

{"postId":"533272568535711744","postText":["Guess how much money Bill Gross made last year? Exclusive by @ritholtz:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["How much compensation the folks at Pacific Investment Management Co., better known as Pimco, haul in each year has always been a topic of fascination on Wall Street.","In 2012, news reports suggested that the firm's top 30 partners \"pulled down an average $33 million a year in compensation in recent years.\" A subsequent column by Felix Salmon guessed that the average investment professional at Pimco was making \"roughly $7 million each\" annually.","A Pimco spokesman denied Salmon's claim, responding that \"The numbers cited in your blog post today are wildly inaccurate.\"","Salmon's speculation was, indeed, wildly inaccurate -- to the downside. Actual bonuses at Pimco are higher, much higher, than probably any outsiders previously believed. Based on news reports, public records and new data obtained by Bloomberg View, it appears that Pimco had a 2013 bonus pool for its 60 managing directors of almost $1.5 billion.","So how much have Pimco's top executives earned? According to documents provided to Bloomberg View by someone with knowledge of Pimco's bonus policies, the numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013. Mohamed El-Erian, Pimco's former chief executive officer and one-time heir apparent to Gross, received $230 million (El-Erian is a fellow Bloomberg View contributor).","And the story doesn't end with Pimco's two most visible (former) employees. Former deputy chief investment officer Daniel Ivascyn -- now serving as Gross's replacement as Pimco's chief investment officer -- took home a $70 million bonus. Wendy W. Cupps, the global head of product management, garnered $50 million, making her one of the highest-paid woman in finance. (Her rocky push into equities was the subject of well-publicized haranguing by Gross.) Douglas Hodge, now the CEO, took home $45 million of holiday cheer. These giant bonuses almost make the $22 million awarded to Pimco\u2019s president, Jay Jacobs, seem puny.","The top three managers after Gross and El-Erian -- Ivascyn, Cupps and Jacobs -- were rumored to have been behind the coup that sent Gross packing to Janus Capital in September. Next month, free of Gross and El-Erian, these three will have an extra half a billion or so to keep to themselves or distribute to the other managing directors.","Gross\u2019s bonus -- 20 percent of the total bonus pool for 2013 -- places him in a compensation class of his very own. To put that figure into context, in 2013 Gross made just shy of what the next 20 publicly held finance company CEOs made combined.","In the world of sports, you would have to take the total salaries, winnings and endorsement deals of LeBron James, Lionel Messi, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods and Roger Federer -- together -- to be on par with Gross.","* * *","How Pimco became such an earnings machine is a quirk.","It has been four decades since it was spun out of Pacific Life Insurance Co., a move that was made in part to allow Gross a freer hand to manage the insurer\u2019s fixed income portfolio. Since then, Pimco has grown into a behemoth, in terms of the bottom line and as a force in the bond market.","Much of what we know about Pimco stems from Allianz SE's $3.3 billion purchase of 70 percent of the firm in 2000. A publicly traded German insurer, Allianz has released some details about Pimco\u2019s operations in its quarterly earnings reports. That data, along with mutual fund disclosures and filings, provide hints about the firm\u2019s revenue.","We can estimate earnings by looking at the largest Pimco funds. The 20 biggest have an average fee of about 61 basis points. Let\u2019s lower that to account for discounts given to large institutional clients, and we get a rough estimate of about 50 basis points. On $1.82 trillion dollars, that yields $9.1 billion in revenue a year.","Pimco is, by any measure, a fabulously wealthy company. Using my back-of-the-envelope revenue estimate, it generates far more revenue per employee than any bank or asset manager -- almost four times as much as Goldman Sachs.","When Allianz bought into Pimco, it picked up about $250 billion in assets under management. Pimco currently manages about $2 trillion.","The bonus structure is a quirk of that original deal: Allianz\u2019 partial purchase left Pacific Life owning 30 percent of Pimco. But Pacific Life wasn't interested in running the asset-management business and even after the Allianz deal, everyone involved continued to defer to Gross\u2019s financial and managerial judgment.","Thus Pimco -- based in Newport beach, California, and 6,000 miles removed from its majority owners -- remained fully autonomous. Bloomberg View's fee analysis suggests Allianz takes about 70 percent of the total revenue Pimco generates annually (plus or minus a few percentage points). Pimco keeps the rest.","This same deal structure continued even after Allianz purchased the 30 percent of Pimco that it didn't already own from Pacific Life in the mid-2000s. A subsequent restructuring in 2011 saw Gross and his team gain even greater control over the firm. That gave Pimco so much freedom in relation to its corporate parent that, as one analyst described it to Bloomberg News, it appeared as if it was \"the tail wagging the dog.\"","* * *","Part of the reason for Gross's longevity after the Allianz takeover -- and another element of the firm's enormous wealth -- is what we might call the \"Pimco Premium.\" Despite being in a competitive field including giant companies such as Vanguard and Blackrock, Pimco manages to charge more than the industry standard for access to its funds and its separately managed accounts.","Why? When competing for business, the firm has had an unbeatable combination of a long history and outstanding long-term results. (At least it did, until recent bad bets on rising interest rates by Gross torpedoed the 1-, 3- and 5-year record of the flagship Total Return Fund.)","Pimco also became the go-to company for the Federal Reserve and U.S. Treasury in many of the credit facilities used to combat the continuing economic fallout from the financial crisis. Pimco's success in the federal government's program to jumpstart consumer lending and a variety of mortgage-backed security programs added more luster to its reputation. Gross even managed to buy up lots of MBS's before the Fed officially announced the programs. Shareholders of the Total Return Fund netted about $10 billion from its mortgage plays.","Beyond the sheer size of Pimco's bonuses, there are other aspects of its compensation practices that should give pause to everyone involved in institutional asset management.","For one, Pimco has been part of a publicly traded company -- Allianz -- for the past 15 years. Unbeknownst to Allianz's shareholders, employees of one of its business units have been paying themselves these extraordinarily large sums of money.","In the U.S., it is hard to imagine $1.5 billion in spending on anything not being disclosed. Almost 16 percent of Pimco's revenue is a \"material\" amount of money that would normally require disclosure in the U.S. But Allianz is a German company, subject to different regulations.","Another item worth noticing: Pimco investors represent pension funds, foundations, charitable trusts, 401ks and other retirement accounts. Pimco's enormous, self-paid bonuses come right off of the top of the returns those outside investors might otherwise receive.","In a recent Allianz presentation following Gross' departure from Pimco, the firm's new chief executive, Doug Hodge, stated, \"We don't comment on matters of compensation.\"","But while Gross may be gone, the high fees and compensation structure at Pimco appear to remain firmly in place. Allianz doesn't seem inclined to change things -- it started a $279 million award program this fall to keep people from following Gross out the door.","However, if there is going to be change, it can only come from Pimco's big institutional customers. Why should they pay a Pimco Premium? Pimco's profits are down by 7.9 percent in the third quarter of this year, and the firm saw saw almost $50 billion in outflows last month. Janus, Gross's new home, has managed to attract only about $430 million in new money since he joined.","The market for fixed income asset management has never been in greater flux than it is today. The realignment of power among bond managers is only just beginning. If ever there was a moment when investors could demand more competitive fees from their bond managers, it is now.","Perhaps it might also be a good time for Pimco itself to consider slicing its fees. Anecdotally, stories abound of Pimco institutional salespeople offering steep one-year fee discounts as a way to retain assets.","If I were managing Pimco (even from 6,000 miles away), I would be looking at ways to make those fee reductions more permanent. I bet I even could find close to a billion and a half dollars in savings."],"targetTitle":"Guess How Much Money Bill Gross Made Last Year?","targetDescription":"The numbers break down like this: Gross earned $290 million as his year-end bonus for 2013.","targetKeywords":"Money,Earnings,Investment Management,Wall Street,Bond Market,Fixed Income,Sports,California,Wealth,Interest Rates,Federal Reserve,U.S. Treasury,Retirement","targetMedia":["http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/idaOcRVeUxoY\/v1\/120x120.jpg","https:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/users\/iqjWHBFdfxIU\/iKzjInUDN4qE\/v1\/1200x-1.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/users\/iqjWHBFdfxIU\/iKzjInUDN4qE\/v1\/1200x-1.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/iz9_DLhdXefQ\/v1\/120x120.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/i1JWQKZPC96A\/v1\/120x120.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/iui7bQYay2Cc\/v1\/120x120.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/izgCxnl7Ri4I\/v1\/120x120.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/ijfX17VuNa34\/v1\/120x120.jpg","http:\/\/assets.bwbx.io\/images\/users\/iqjWHBFdfxIU\/iK2WFiEHsevU\/v0\/120x120.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/bv.ms\/1ut6B6e","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"$290,000,000","spoilerPublisher":"SavedYouAClick"},"spoiler":["$290 million"],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,198],[4,210]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":338}

This January, the World Bank published a 330-page report showing how the largest technology companies are increasing income inequality rather than helping it. \"Some of the perceived benefits of digital technologies are offset by emerging risks,\" the report said. \"Many advanced economies face increasingly polarized labor markets and rising inequality\u2014in part because technology augments higher skills while replacing routine jobs, forcing many workers to compete for low-paying jobs.\"","That\u2019s exactly what happened when Facebook attracted thousands of new residents into the Menlo Park area, where its headquarters is located. Most of the new residents are well-educated, high-income earners who drove up housing pricers, forced lower income families to move, and exacerbated income inequality throughout the area. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t win Mark Zuckerberg many new friends in the area.","Meanwhile, Facebook is trying to win support for a lucrative proposal to expand its headquarters by 1.1 million square feet. The proposal is still missing some important details, though. For starters, it\u2019s still unclear if Facebook itself will develop the buildings or hire a third party. Secondly, it\u2019s also unclear what the timeline for the development is. Despite lacking specifics, the impact of the proposal is obvious: Facebook would dramatically increase its footprint in an area where it\u2019s already driven up real estate prices and driven out those who can\u2019t afford the rent.","Sponsored","This isn\u2019t the first time Facebook has been involved in controversial housing development, either. In 2013, the company built a 394-unit housing community within walking distance of its offices that included its own sports bar, outdoor pool, and pet daycare.","At the time, a Wall Street Journal report referred to the project as being similar to a \"company town,\" the name for small communities built by robber barons of the 20th century that housed factory workers. The employers provided everything including health care, law enforcement, and even churches. Towns like Pullman, Illinois were created as \"capitalist utopias.\" But ultimately, the bosses failed to protect workers and residents.","Is Facebook turning Menlo Park into a 21st century version of Pullman? It\u2019s too soon to tell. The new office expansion is slated service at least 6,500 new employees and offering housing to the general public to offset crowding concerns is certainly a gesture on Facebook\u2019s part. But while some poor people will get homes in the new real estate development, it\u2019s surely won\u2019t be enough to fix the area\u2019s greater socioeconomic problems.","[Wall Street Journal]"],"targetTitle":"Facebook Is Building Apartments Anyone Can Rent\u2014But There's a Huge Catch","targetDescription":"Facebook could be your next landlord.

Just look at 2016: Atlanta, The People v OJ, Veep, The Night Of, Stranger Things, Westworld... the list of brilliant TV shows goes on. ","Many of the best - including the likes of Bojack Horseman, House of Cards, and The Walking Dead - took viewers down dark, emotional roads. The latter show, for instance, saw numerous popular characters killed off. The former saw an animated horse\u2019s continued existential crises hit a new low. House of Cards offered another petrifying take on the political climate.","One show many consider to have a doom-mongering, pessimistic view of life is Black Mirror, the Channel 4 show picked up by Netflix. Season three offered some of the darkest episodes yet: just look at \"Shut Up and Dance\", centring on a young man being blackmailed into doing terrible tasks for a group of hackers, featuring a horrendous final twist.","Among those six new episodes, though, lies \u2018San Junipero', a somewhat enigma when it comes to the series. Instead of telling a morbid, freighting tale about a dystopian future, creator - and the episode\u2019s writer - Charlie Brooker decided to tell the wonderful love story of two women. **Spoilers ahead**","In the episode, the wonderfully awkward Yorkie - played by Mackenzie Davis - falls helplessly in love with Kelly (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) while partying at the Californian beach resort San Junipero. This is no ordinary love story, though, as the pair mysteriously meet each other in different time periods over a number of weekends. How? Because San Junipero isn\u2019t a real place: it\u2019s a realistic virtual reality; a place the consciousness is uploaded to rather than physically visited. ","It transpires that Yorkie - despite appearing to be in her 20s in San Junipero - is actually an elderly, paralysed woman, living in an assisted living facility with only six months left. Kelly, meanwhile, is actually based in a separate retirement home, seeing out her days in San Junipero. ","Eventually, after overcoming some reticent feelings, the pair meet up in real life and marry so Kelly can formerly authorise Yorkie\u2019s euthanasia, putting her out of her pain. Yorkie is then uploaded to San Junipero. Kelly, however, rejects Yorkie\u2019s advances to also fully upload her consciousness to San Junipero once she dies because of a promise to her previous husband. After months of deliberating, and a worsening condition, Kelly decides to upload her consciousness to San Junipero, living out her days with Yorkie.","Written down, it sounds like a semi-morbid tale of death. Yet, what transpires is a heartfelt tale of two women who decide, in spite of everything, to be together, their love overwhelming rational thinking. Is there really anything more life affirming than a love story where love reigns triumphant?","Well, there\u2019s one issue. As the episode finishes, there\u2019s a lasting shot of the computer servers keeping Yorkie and Kelly\u2019s consciousness \u2018alive' - the \u2018TCKR\u2019 system.

My grandmother spoke five languages, so that she could communicate with all of her grandchildren, and knew exactly how everyone liked their tea. And everyone liked it differently, all with slightly different amounts of sugar.","Upon receiving the unexpected phone call, a sleepless night (pierced by even more phone calls) led to a hazy 40 hours which was broken up by a taxi, two planes, a few chocolate bars, a muted airport greeting and another car journey.

The oppression of the midday sun had subsided slightly, and if we stretched our legs, she said, we would feel better about the tea and sweets we could have when we got back home.","Calicut, where I was born, is a city on India's south-west coast. I often thought, with no authority other than nostalgic affection, that it looked like someone had cut roads into the middle of a lush forest. There's significantly less traffic than in many other cities in India. Coconut trees line the streets, as the Arabian Sea sparkles to the west and the Wayanad hills rise in the east.","During the 13th Century, Calicut became a major port for the Indian Ocean trade route. Merchants were said to manipulate the monsoon winds to transport spices, cotton - and sugar - from there to the West.","And as my aunt and I took our walk, we passed several street vendors. A man was pulping sugar canes into a drink.","Feeling slightly light-headed, I was tempted to buy one when something else caught my eye.","On the side of the road, under a papaya tree, a one-room shop, that I had been familiar with my whole life, was boarded up.","It had belonged to a tailor named Padmanabhan.

And you find yourself singing Coldplay lyrics on repeat. No one ever said it would be easy, but\u2014dammit\u2014no one ever said it would be this freaking hard either.","Everywhere you look, you see hap-hap-happy couples. You see the smiling picture perfect family photos on Facebook and think to yourself, I bet they don\u2019t fight about what kind of cereal to buy. You see other parents and wonder if they were up until 2 a.m. bickering about whose turn it was to get up with the baby. You see cute couples at the park on the weekend, pushing their toddlers in the swings, and doubt they have ever gone through the low-grade suckiness that you\u2019re in right now.","Well, I can assure you that they have. We all have. Sure, our \"hard times\" all look different\u2014because each marriage is different\u2014but I assure you that we\u2019ve all been through our own rocky stretches on the path to marital bliss.","Because here\u2019s the thing that no one tells you: Marriage is fucking hard. It will suck sometimes.","And do you know what else they don\u2019t tell you? It\u2019s OK that marriage is hard and sucky sometimes. You will be OK. Your marriage will be OK.","Here\u2019s a few other things no one tells you about marriage, the things that no one writes in your bridal shower scrapbook of cliche\u0301d-crock-of-shit advice:","There will be fights.","You will fight about big things and little things and things you don\u2019t even care about. You will fight about whether to shop at Walmart or Costco, about whether your son needs a haircut, and whether your Aunt Josie is a racist or just an idiot. You will argue late into the night about whether to sign your daughter up for dance lessons or the soccer team. You will have drop-down, drag-out brawls about whether the toilet seat should be left up or down. And you will give each other the silent treatment for two days after one of you suggests that your mother might be a little \"needy.\"","There will be anger.","In fact, you might scare yourself with the depth of blind rage that you feel when you see his socks on the floor or hear her loud chewing. You might want to smother him with a pillow when he snores blissfully as you get up in the middle of the night\u2014again!\u2014to feed the baby, get the toddler a drink of water, or calm the big kid after a scary dream. You might nearly lose your fucking mind when she runs out of gas\u2014again!\u2014and you need to leave a work meeting early and drive 60 minutes round-trip to pick her up.","There will be score-keeping.","You will tally up who slept less and who worked longer hours. You will keep track of who changed the last diaper and whose turn it is to control the remote. You measure who spends more hours chauffeuring the kids to soccer practice and ballet lessons, and who spends more hours working in a dead-end job that pays the bills and puts food on the table. You will keep score of the number of socks on the floor, dirty dishes in the sink, and toilet paper rolls unchanged.","And there will be hard times.","And not the romantic hypothetical hard times that you imagined before you had kids, the kind that involve short fights followed by steamy make-up sex. No. Marriage is really fucking hard sometimes.","But here\u2019s something else no one might have told you: It\u2019s OK that marriage is hard.","Because even with the fighting and the anger and the difficult times, marriage is pretty fucking great. The truth is, some of the most amazing things in life\u2014marriage and parenting among them\u2014are really hard work. Marriage is not all heart-shaped rainbows and diamonds made from unicorn poop. Marriage is not skipping in the park together before having porn star sex in the middle of the afternoon. And marriage is not one of those cheesy status updates on Facebook with words like \"soul mates\" and \"#soblessed.\"","Marriage is hard work, and there will be difficult times now and then. Because when you share your freaking life with someone else\u2014raising a family and building careers, paying taxes and choosing Netflix shows\u2014it is impossible not to get bogged down in the muck now and then.","But you will get through it. You will remember that you\u2019re on the same team. You will fight, and then you will forgive. You will compromise. You will get therapy if you need to. You will take a deep breath, flip each other off, and then laugh at yourselves.","So fear not, you are not alone. Marriage is hard for everyone now and then. And making it through those sucky stretches might even make your marriage better. Because even though marriage has its hard and shitty days, marriage is also knowing you have someone on your side who will hold an umbrella over you when the shit hits the fan."],"targetTitle":"What No One Tells You About Marriage","targetDescription":"Let's cut to the chase already.

{"postId":"55968w","postText":["Six of the last seven times this happened, stocks rose"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["After three winning quarters for the market, what will the fourth bring?","If history repeats, stocks could be in for a sweet end to the year. In the last seven years in which the S&P 500 rose in each of the first three quarters, only in one of them \u2014 2007 \u2014 did the index drop in the fourth.","Actually, when one looks at the entire performance history of the S&P 500 going back to 1928 (which is available despite the fact that the index was technically created in 1957) one finds that out of the 19 years in which the market rose in the first, second and third quarters, a negative fourth quarter only followed five times. In these 19 years, the S&P's median performance was a 4.1 percent gain, according to a CNBC analysis of FactSet data.","That 74 percent \"win rate\" and impressive median gain for fourth quarters following three consecutive winning quarters compares to a 62 percent win rate for the S&P over all of its 355 quarters, and average quarterly performance of a 2.5 percent gain. However, it is also the case that the fourth quarter just happens to be better for investors in general; the market rose in 73 percent of fourth quarters, and actually turned out a better median performance of a 4.5 percent gain.","The recent rises seen in fourth quarters can thus be ascribed to market seasonality \u2014 or, perhaps more credibly, to mere randomness.","But for the bullish strategist Tom Lee of Fundstrat, who has pointed to similar figures in the past, something more is at work. Lee argues that in years when stocks are doing well, active managers will invest heavily in an attempt to avoid lagging the market too badly \u2014 creating an additional bullish force in the market. The fact that 2016 has been a good year so far is therefore a reason to bet that stocks will rise, he concludes.","So will the fourth quarter, which begins on Monday, continue the bullish trend?","Unfortunately, marshaling stats all day can obscure but can never alter the fact this question is patently unanswerable."],"targetTitle":"Six of the last seven times this happened, stocks

With smart shopping, those pounds can quickly add up to savings of thousands over the course of a year.' ","Here, FEMAIL rounds up the seven best tips... ","BUY CLOTHES OUT OF SEASON  ","It might be hard to think of winter in spring, but planning ahead seasonally can help you save a bundle on clothes and shoes. ","A \u00a3100 winter coat could be down to \u00a350 in spring as retailers clear stock, so thinking ahead to what you'll need in nine months time will reap major rewards. ","If you can train yourself to think ahead to summer wear in the autumn, you'll see that the clearance sale prices can leave you with money in your pocket.","STOCKPILE WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT ","If you see a good deal on something you'll use, it's often cost-effective to stockpile.  ","Buying more will therefore increase your savings in the long term as you use your discounted purchases even when that item goes back to its standard price.","Cathal explained: 'Take for example a family using two \u00a31 tins of tomatoes in a big weekly pasta dish. That's \u00a3104 of tinned tomatoes, so stockpiling those tins when they're available at half price could put \u00a352 back into the family finances every year. ","'You can do this with non-perishable food goods, but also other items like cleaning and personal hygiene products, which are regularly heavily discounted. Just make sure to do the maths.' ","ASK FOR DISCOUNTS  ","It might sound too good to be true, but you would be surprised how often you can get a discount if you just ask. ","This is especially true with big-name chains like phone shops, and homewares and electricals outlets, where flexible discounting can often be part of their retail policies.   ","In-store offers can help you save on your weekly shop, but your receipts could help you save hundreds of pounds too.","Apps such as ClickSnap feature grocery discounts and even freebies. It works by refunding the cost of certain goods after you upload a picture of your receipt, with dozens of different promotional offers every week.","DON'T BE AFRAID TO PRAISE AND COMPLAIN ","Companies love when the people who enjoy their products tell them about it. ","If you just send a letter to the freepost address of the manufacturer, they will often send you goodies or vouchers to say thank you. The same goes for advocating for your favourite products and services on social media, as it's not unusual for them to get back to you to say thanks with some freebies. ","CHECK FOR A CASHBACK DEAL   ","On top of discounts, there is a cashback deal to be found on nearly everything we buy online. If you shop through Quidco you can commonly get 5 per cent, 10 per cent or more in cashback on whatever you buy. With average annual savings of \u00a3305, it's a money-saving habit worth picking up. ","START A SAVINGS ACCOUNT  ","Starting a savings account can fall down the list of priorities for many of us because the returns might not immediately be huge. But very few people know how to get big cash bonuses when they start a savings account."],"targetTitle":"The seven simple money-saving hacks that could save you THOUSANDS a year (from stockpiling discounted goods to buying your winter coat in the summer)\u00a0","targetDescription":"From changing your shopping habits to asking for a better deal, these surprisingly simple hacks prove you don't need to cut back on the things you love to save money.","targetKeywords":"Lifestyle,hacks,save,thousands","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["BUY CLOTHES OUT OF SEASON","STOCKPILE WHEN THE PRICE IS RIGHT","ASK FOR DISCOUNTS","DON'T BE AFRAID TO PRAISE AND COMPLAIN","CHECK FOR A CASHBACK DEAL"],"spoilerPositions":[[[6,0],[6,25]],[[10,0],[10,33]],[[15,0],[15,17]],[[20,0],[20,38]],[[23,0],[23,25]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":358}
{"postId":"4ww3qr","postText":["Why Rio ratings are terrible"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Michael Phelps. Photo: Adam Pretty","Critics and social media have predecessor. Critics and social media have savaged NBC \u2019s early coverage of the Rio Olympics \u2014 and the early ratings verdict from Nielsen has not been any kinder. Viewership for the first three nights of the Peacock\u2019s prime-time broadcasts is down sharply compared to both the 2012 London and 2008 Beijing games, with younger audiences bailing in particularly big numbers. It\u2019s not all bad news: Tens of millions of Americans are still watching the Olympics, some viewing has likely shifted to online platforms not immediately measured by Nielsen, and Sunday\u2019s swimming-centric schedule resulted in a big ratings surge. But if the early pattern holds, Rio will be the first summer Olympics since Sydney 2000 to score lower Nielsen numbers than itspredecessor.","The first sign of trouble for NBC \u2019s Rio ratings came Saturday morning, when data for Friday\u2019s never-ending opening ceremony came in. Per Nielsen, the minimalist curtain-raiser notched a 13.9 household rating (i.e., the percentage of homes with TV sets tuned to the Olympics). While that\u2019s more than two times the audience for the typical episode of the summer\u2019s No. 1 series, NBC \u2019s America\u2019s Got Talent , it represents an eye-popping 35 percent drop from night one of the London games (which notched a 21.0 rating) and the lowest rating for an opening ceremony in at least 20 years. (The runner-up? Athens 2004, which averaged a 14.6 rating.) Worse, the 13.9 rating is just barely ahead of the average edition of NBC \u2019s Sunday Night Football last fall (12.9) rating.","Things didn\u2019t improve much on Saturday, the first night of competition: NBC averaged an 11.4 for its prime-time broadcast, down about 28 percent from London\u2019s 15.8 and another at least 20-year low. Part of the problem is big defections among millennial audiences, i.e. the audience segment most likely to be turned off by NBC \u2019s non-stop commercial breaks. Final numbers aren\u2019t in yet, but among adults aged 18 to 34, it looks like Friday\u2019s opening was down around 43 percent compared to London (versus the aforementioned 35 percent decline among viewers of all ages). Perhaps some of that audience shifted to NBC \u2019s livestream simulcast, but given how much of the network\u2019s ad revenue is tied to linear ratings, that won\u2019t be of much comfort to Peacock accountants. Still, expect NBC to play up big gains for digital and other platforms when it releases so-called \"total audience\" measurement data later this week.","It\u2019s also far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster. NBC \u2019s Olympics ratings often rise and fall based on how well the U.S. team is doing at any given time, and Sunday\u2019s stellar swimming performances by Katie Ledecky and Michael Phelps \u2014 telegraphed by social media ahead of their broadcast to American audiences \u2014 delivered a massive Nielsen boost for NBC . Early numbers show the network\u2019s prime-time coverage jumping to a best-yet 15.9 household rating, the first time since Athens 2004 that a night three of the Olympics has come in ahead of the opening ceremonies. What\u2019s more, while viewership was still down compared to London, it fell a more modest 20 percent and looks to be above tune-in for the comparable nights in both Athens and Sydney. If Team USA can keep winning, NBC still has a shot at making up some of the losses from the first weekend of the Games."],"targetTitle":"Rio Olympics Ratings Are the Worst They\u2019ve Been in Years","targetDescription":"If Team USA can keep winning, that may change.","targetKeywords":"2016 olympics, nbc, ratings","targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/bmY5H\/66841c4f2e7cf12a6ef4d920fc0b9ef431a81e4c.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/bmY5H\/9099b809706b56d6814cd46078aaa483ea619f20\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/bmY5H\/ef35b2187b0f8b194e067a86c612cc4f85285bce.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/bmY5H","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Too soon to tell, probably streaming","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["far too early to declare Rio any sort of ratings disaster"],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,10],[4,67]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":359}

Thirty-six percent of respondents said that the relationship would be improved by more communication, while 34 percent said that it would make no difference. Another 10 percent said it would actually make things worse.","And although more approved than disapproved of Obama's phone conversation with Rouhani, outlook on Obama's handling of Iran was more bleak. Thirty-six percent said that they approved of Obama's handling of issues with Iran, while 46 percent said that they disapproved.","The vast majority of Democrats approved of both Obama's approach to Iran as a whole and of his phone call with Rouhani, while the vast majority of Republicans disapproved. But independents disapproved of Obama's Iran approach, 52 percent to 26 percent, while a plurality approved of the conversation with Rouhani, 42 percent to 33 percent.","Few said that they had heard much about the conversation between Obama and Rouhani. Twenty-four percent of respondents said they had heard a lot, 48 percent that they had heard a little and 28 percent had heard nothing at all.","The poll found that most still consider Iran to be unfriendly to the United States, including 43 percent who said it is an enemy and 33 percent who said that it is unfriendly. A total of only 6 percent said that Iran was either an ally or at least friendly to the United States. Still, that outlook reflected an improvement over a YouGov poll conducted in mid-September, when 51 percent described Iran as an enemy.","The HuffPost\/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 30-Oct. 1 among 1,000 U.S. adults using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.

This year, however, the Russian Orthodox Church is doing something different.","It's formally celebrating St. Patrick's Day for the first time \u2014 but on March 30.","Earlier this month, the church announced it would finally recognize the day in commemoration of Saint Patrick, a missionary who had lived in the 5th century and is now widely known as the patron saint of Ireland. Orthodox leaders told the Russian media they hoped that recognizing Saint Patrick and a number of other western saints would show the shared roots of different branches of Christianity, before the Schism of 1054 that divided the faith into East and West.","Despite this, the divide between the two wings of Christianity means that the Russian Orthodox Church will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day along with the rest of the world. While the Catholic Church adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 16th century, the Russian Orthodox Church still uses the older Julian calendar. The two calendars are about two weeks out of sync.","This means that the day of St. Patrick's death \u2014 March 17 in the Gregorian calendar \u2014 falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church.","The March 30 date seems likely to extend Russia's St. Patrick's Day festivities rather than replace them. Russia has held events celebrating the day since the fall of communism. More than 15,000 people are expected to attend this year's official parade in Moscow, which will take place on March 18; the parade itself is part of a larger spread of events related to Ireland that take place March 15 to 26.","In a statement given to the Govorit Moskva radio station, the Irish government said it was glad the Russian Orthodox Church had made the decision. \"We hope to see our friends in Moscow on all of our Irish events in the next two weeks,\" said Arthur Hendrick, consul at the Irish Embassy in Moscow.","For members of the Orthodox faith, celebrating two St. Patrick's days may not be an option: March 17 falls in the middle of the Orthodox observance of Lent, when many religious Russians abstain from alcohol. Father Igor Fomin, head of a church at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, told Tass news agency that getting drunk in honor of a saint is like being heavily intoxicated at your mother\u2019s gravesite.","\"I am very happy that our St. Patrick\u2019s Day falls on a different date, that way the traditions associated with it, that are strictly cultural and not religious can be ignored,\" Fomin said."],"targetTitle":"Why Russia has two St. Patrick\u2019s days this year","targetDescription":"Both March 17 and March 30 mark the day in Russia.","targetKeywords":"St. Patrick's Day, Saint Patrick, St. Patrick, Russia, Ireland, Russia Orthodox Church","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["This means that the day of St. Patrick's death \u2014 March 17 in the Gregorian calendar \u2014 falls on March 30 for the Russian Orthodox Church."],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,0],[4,136]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":363}

Since that did not occur Turner is a criminal, a sex offender \u2013 but he isn\u2019t, according to the law, a rapist.","\ue001 \ue001 Play Current Time 0:00 \/ Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00 \ue000 Fullscreen Playback Rate 1 \ue00c Subtitles subtitles off \ue008 Captions captions settings","captions settings captions off \ue00c Chapters Chapters \ue006 Mute 00:00 \ue805 Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done \ue800 Close Share Video: Share via: \ue801 Facebook","\ue802 Google+","\ue803 Twitter","\ue804 tumblr","\ue806 Pinterest","\ue807 LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code: \ue808 Restart \u2018Heroic\u2019 Swedish student who stopped Stanford rape describes what he saw","It is notable that America\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigations defines rape differently, as \"penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object...without the consent of the victim\". That reflects the trend in state laws, although there remains considerable variation between jurisdictions, both with regard to the terminology used and the ranking of distinct types of sexual assault as to their seriousness. California is among a handful of states which continue to criminalise \u2018object penetration\u2019 to a lesser degree than penile penetration.","Even so, Turner\u2019s crimes could have seen him receive a maximum of 14 years in prison. Even putting aside the precise definition of his conviction, it is no wonder that his six month sentence has received such criticism.","Under English law, Turner wouldn\u2019t be classified as a rapist either. As in California, the offence of rape is strictly confined to a man penetrating another person with his penis in the absence of consent. That is why a woman cannot be convicted of rape except in circumstances where she assists a man to commit the crime.","\ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life \ue612 \ue611","\ue607 19 show all \ue603 \ue607 Countries where sexual violence has become a way of life","\ue612 \ue611 1\/19 Afghanistan Recommendation: I urge the Government of Afghanistan to adopt legislative reforms to ensure that sexual violence offences are not conflated with adultery or \"morality crimes\" and to establish infrastructure for the delivery of protection, health and le gal services to survivors. I call on the Ministry of the Interior to accelerate efforts to integrate women into the Afghan National Police, thereby enhancing its outreach and its capacity to address sexual and gender-based violence","2\/19 Central African Republic Recommendation: I urge the authorities of the Central African Republic to ensure that efforts to restore security and the rule of law take into account the prevention of sexual violence and that monitoring of the ceasefire and peace agreement explicitly reflects this consideration, in line with the joint communique\u0301 of the Government and the United Nations on the prevention of and response to conflict-related sexual violence signed in December 2012. I further encourage the authorities to make the rapid response unit to combat sexual violence operational and to establish a special criminal court","3\/19 Colombia Recommendation: I commend the Government of Colombia for the progress made to date and its collaboration with the United Nations, including through the visit of my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict in March 2015. I encourage the authorities to implement Law 1719 and continue to prosecute cases of sexual violence committed during the conflict to ensure that survivors receive justice and receive reparations. Conflict-related sexual violence should continue to be addressed in the Havana peace talks, as well as in the resulting accords and transitional justice mechanisms. Particular attention should be paid to groups that face additional barriers to justice such as ethnic minorities, women in rural areas, children, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals and women abused within the ranks of armed groups. I encourage the Government to scale up its protection measures and share its good practices with other conflict-affected countries","4\/19 Congo Recommendation: I urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to ensure full implementation of the armed forces action plan against sexual violence, to systematically bring perpetrators to justice and to deliver reparations to victims, including payment of outstanding compensation awards. I call on donors and the United Nations system to support the Government in its efforts and to pay increased attention to neglected areas, including unregulated mining regions","5\/19 Iraq Recommendation: I commend the Government of Iraq for its national action plan for the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and urge its swift implementation, including by training its security forces to ensur e respect for women\u2019s rights. Programmes to support the social reintegration of women and girls released from captivity by ISIL are urgently needed, as is community-based medical and psychological care. The capacity of the United Nations system should be enhanced through the deployment of Women\u2019s Protection Advisers or equivalent specialists","6\/19 Libya Recommendation: I urge the national authorities in Libya to implement Decree No. 119 and Resolution 904 of 2014 to ensure redress for all victims, including those affected by the current conflict, through the establishment of multisectoral services and the adoption of legislation to categorically prohibit sexual violence","7\/19 Mali Recommendation: I urge the Government of Mali, with support from United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict, to develop a comprehensive national strategy to combat sexual and gender-based violence and to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers so that services can reach remote areas. I further call on all parties to ensure that conflict-related sexual violence is addressed in the inter-Malian dialogue and that perpetrators of sexual violence do not benefit from amnesty or early release","8\/19 Myanmar Recommendation: I urge the Government of Myanmar to continue with its reform agenda and, in the process, take practical and timely actions to protect and support survivors of conflict-related sexual violence and to ensure that security personnel accused of such crimes are prosecuted. Sexual violence should be an element in all ceasefire and peace negotiations, excluded from the scope of amnesty provisions and addressed in transitional justice processes. It is critical that women be able to participate consistently in and influence these processes","9\/19 Somalia Recommendation: I reiterate my call to the Federal Government of Somalia to implement the commitments made under the joint communique\u0301 of 7 May 2013 and its national action plan to combat sexual violence in conflict, including specific plans for the army and the police. I encourage the adoption of a sexual offences bill as a matter of priority","10\/19 South Sudan Recommendation: I urge the parties to the conflict in South Sudan to adopt action plans to implement the commitments made under their respective communique\u0301s. I call upon the Government of South Sudan to address the negative impact of customary law on women\u2019s rights and to reflect international human rights standards in national law. I also encourage the African Union to make public and act upon the report of its Commission of Inquiry on South Sudan","11\/19 Sudan (Darfur) Recommendation: I call upon the Government of the Sudan to grant the United Nations and its humanitarian partners unfettered access for monitoring and the provision of assistance to people in need in Darfur. Given that there has been grave concern over sexual violence in Darfur for more than a decade, I encourage the Government to engage with my Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict to develop a framework of cooperation to address the issue comprehensively","12\/19 Syria Recommendation: I acknowledge the Government\u2019s invitation to my Special Representative to visit the Syrian Arab Republic and call upon the authorities, in the context of such a visit, to agree on specific measures to prevent sexual violence, including by members of the security forces. I condemn the use of sexual violence by ISIL and all other parties listed in the annex to the present report and call on them to cease such violations immediately and allow unfettered access for the delivery of humanitarian assistance","13\/19 Yemen Recommendation: I urge the authorities in Yemen to undertake legislative reform as a basis for addressing impunity for sexual violence, ensuring the provision of services for survivors and aligning the minimum legal age of marriage with international standards. I further call on the authorities to engage with local community and faithbased leaders to address sexual and gender-based violence and discriminatory social norms","14\/19 Bosnia and Herzegovina Recommendation: I urge the relevant authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to harmonize legislation and policies so that the rights of survivors of conflict-related sexual violence to reparations are consistently recognized and to allocate a specific budget for this purpose. I further call upon the authorities to protect and support survivors participating in judicial proceedings through, inter alia, referrals to free legal aid, psychosocial and health services, as well as economic empowerment programmes","15\/19 Ivory Coast Recommendation: I urge the Government of Co\u0302te d\u2019Ivoire to ensure the effective implementation of its national strategy to combat gender-based violence and the action plan for FRCI, and call on the international community to support these efforts. It is critical to accelerate disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and strengthen law enforcement to ensure that ex-combatants who have been reintegrated into the transport sector do not pose a risk to women and girls who are reliant on those services. The Government and the international community must provide monitoring and awareness-raising to mitigate the possibility of a recurrence of sexual violence in the context of the presidential elections to be held in October 2015","16\/19 Liberia Recommendation: I call on the Government of Liberia to continue its critical efforts to combat sexual and gender-based violence including through the United Nations-Government of Liberia Joint Programme, and in the context of recovery from the Ebola virus epidemic","17\/19 Nepal Recommendation: I encourage the Government to ensure that survivors of conflict-related sexual violence are recognized under the law as \"conflict victims\", which will enable them to access services, judicial remedies and reparations. I further call on all parties involved in the transitional justice process to ensure that the rights and needs o f survivors of sexual violence are addressed in institutional reforms and that these crimes are excluded from amnesties and statutes of limitations","18\/19 Sri Lanka Recommendation: I call upon the newly elected Government of Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of sexual violence, including against national armed and security forces, and to provide multisectoral services for survivors, including reparations and economic empowerment programmes for women at risk, including war widows and female heads of household","19\/19 Nigeria Recommendation: I encourage the Government to implement its national action plan on the implementation of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) to ensure that women\u2019s protection concerns are mainstreamed throughout its security operations. I also call upon the authorities to guarantee security in and around internally displaced persons camps and to extend medical and psychosocial services to high-risk areas","Whether existing definitions are appropriate entirely depends on your point of view of course. It is not an awfully long time ago that rape was regarded fundamentally not as a crime of violence against women, but as a crime against the property of men (ie their wives or daughters), which is why marital rape was for so long excluded. We have \u2013 for the most part \u2013 moved on from the deepest depths of that patriarchal approach but there any many who argue that the maintenance of \u2018phallo-centric\u2019 rape definitions means that the seriousness of other forms of penetrative assault are underplayed.","Brock Turner\u2019s conviction, and the bravely stark testimony of his victim, have helped to bring these questions about how sexual crimes are defined \u2013 and how that impacts on attitudes towards sentencing \u2013 out into the open. The tragedy is that no level of public debate or outrage can undo the despicable harm he caused to an unconscious woman.","Read the Stanford victim's full impact statement","Your honor,","If it is all right, for the majority of this statement I would like to address the defendant directly.","You don\u2019t know me, but you\u2019ve been inside me, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.","On January 17th, 2015, it was a quiet Saturday night at home. My dad made some dinner and I sat at the table with my younger sister who was visiting for the weekend. I was working full time and it was approaching my bed time. I planned to stay at home by myself, watch some TV and read, while she went to a party with her friends. Then, I decided it was my only night with her, I had nothing better to do, so why not, there\u2019s a dumb party ten minutes from my house, I would go, dance weird like a fool, and embarrass my younger sister. On the way there, I joked that undergrad guys would have braces. My sister teased me for wearing a beige cardigan to a frat party like a librarian. I called myself \"big mama\", because I knew I\u2019d be the oldest one there. I made silly faces, let my guard down, and drank liquor too fast not factoring in that my tolerance had significantly lowered since college.","The next thing I remember I was in a gurney in a hallway. I had dried blood and bandages on the backs of my hands and elbow. I thought maybe I had fallen and was in an admin office on campus. I was very calm and wondering where my sister was. A deputy explained I had been assaulted. I still remained calm, assured he was speaking to the wrong person. I knew no one at this party. When I was finally allowed to use the restroom, I pulled down the hospital pants they had given me, went to pull down my underwear, and felt nothing. I still remember the feeling of my hands touching my skin and grabbing nothing. I looked down and there was nothing. The thin piece of fabric, the only thing between my vagina and anything else, was missing and everything inside me was silenced. I still don\u2019t have words for that feeling. In order to keep breathing, I thought maybe the policemen used scissors to cut them off for evidence.","Then, I felt pine needles scratching the back of my neck and started pulling them out my hair. I thought maybe, the pine needles had fallen from a tree onto my head. My brain was talking my gut into not collapsing. Because my gut was saying, help me, help me.","I shuffled from room to room with a blanket wrapped around me, pine needles trailing behind me, I left a little pile in every room I sat in. I was asked to sign papers that said \"Rape Victim\" and I thought something has really happened. My clothes were confiscated and I stood naked while the nurses held a ruler to various abrasions on my body and photographed them. The three of us worked to comb the pine needles out of my hair, six hands to fill one paper bag. To calm me down, they said it\u2019s just the flora and fauna, flora and fauna. I had multiple swabs inserted into my vagina and anus, needles for shots, pills, had a nikon pointed right into my spread legs. I had long, pointed beaks inside me and had my vagina smeared with cold, blue paint to check for abrasions.","After a few hours of this, they let me shower. I stood there examining my body beneath the stream of water and decided, I don\u2019t want my body anymore. I was terrified of it, I didn\u2019t know what had been in it, if it had been contaminated, who had touched it. I wanted to take off my body like a jacket and leave it at the hospital with everything else.","On that morning, all that I was told was that I had been found behind a dumpster, potentially penetrated by a stranger, and that I should get retested for HIV because results don\u2019t always show up immediately. But for now, I should go home and get back to my normal life. Imagine stepping back into the world with only that information. They gave me huge hugs, and then I walked out of the hospital into the parking lot wearing the new sweatshirt and sweatpants they provided me, as they had only allowed me to keep my necklace and shoes.","My sister picked me up, face wet from tears and contorted in anguish. Instinctively and immediately, I wanted to take away her pain. I smiled at her, I told her to look at me, I\u2019m right here, I\u2019m okay, everything\u2019s okay, I\u2019m right here. My hair is washed and clean, they gave me the strangest shampoo, calm down, and look at me. Look at these funny new sweatpants and sweatshirt, I look like a P.E. teacher, let\u2019s go home, let\u2019s eat something. She did not know that beneath my sweats, I had scratches and bandages on my skin, my vagina was sore and had become a strange, dark color from all the prodding, my underwear was missing, and I felt too empty to continue to speak. That I was also afraid, that I was also devastated. That day we drove home and for hours my sister held me.","My boyfriend did not know what happened, but called that day and said, \"I was really worried about you last night, you scared me, did you make it home okay?\" I was horrified. That\u2019s when I learned I had called him that night in my blackout, left an incomprehensible voicemail, that we had also spoken on the phone, but I was slurring so heavily he was scared for me, that he repeatedly told me to go find my sister. Again, he asked me, \"What happened last night? Did you make it home okay?\" I said yes, and hung up to cry.","I was not ready to tell my boyfriend or parents that actually, I may have been raped behind a dumpster, but I don\u2019t know by who or when or how. If I told them, I would see the fear on their faces, and mine would multiply by tenfold, so instead I pretended the whole thing wasn\u2019t real.","I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was so heavy I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone. After work, I would drive to a secluded place to scream. I didn\u2019t talk, I didn\u2019t eat, I didn\u2019t sleep, I didn\u2019t interact with anyone, and I became isolated from the ones I loved most. For one week after the incident, I didn\u2019t get any calls or updates about that night or what happened to me. The only symbol that proved that it hadn\u2019t just been a bad dream, was the sweatshirt from the hospital in my drawer.","One day, I was at work, scrolling through the news on my phone, and came across an article. In it, I read and learned for the first time about how I was found unconscious, with my hair disheveled, long necklace wrapped around my neck, bra pulled out of my dress, dress pulled off over my shoulders and pulled up above my waist, that I was butt naked all the way down to my boots, legs spread apart, and had been penetrated by a foreign object by someone I did not recognize. This was how I learned what happened to me, sitting at my desk reading the news at work. I learned what happened to me the same time everyone else in the world learned what happened to me. That\u2019s when the pine needles in my hair made sense, they didn\u2019t fall from a tree. He had taken off my underwear, his fingers had been inside of me. I don\u2019t even know this person. I still don\u2019t know this person. When I read about me like this, I said, this can\u2019t be me.","This can\u2019t be me. I could not digest or accept any of this information. I could not imagine my family having to read about this online. I kept reading. In the next paragraph, I read something that I will never forgive; I read that according to him, I liked it. I liked it. Again, I do not have words for these feelings.","At the bottom of the article, after I learned about the graphic details of my own sexual assault, the article listed his swimming times. She was found breathing, unresponsive with her underwear six inches away from her bare stomach curled in fetal position. By the way, he\u2019s really good at swimming. Throw in my mile time if that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. I\u2019m good at cooking, put that in there, I think the end is where you list your extra-curriculars to cancel out all the sickening things that\u2019ve happened.","The night the news came out I sat my parents down and told them that I had been assaulted, to not look at the news because it\u2019s upsetting, just know that I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m right here, and I\u2019m okay. But halfway through telling them, my mom had to hold me because I could no longer stand up. I was not okay.","The night after it happened, he said he didn\u2019t know my name, said he wouldn\u2019t be able to identify my face in a lineup, didn\u2019t mention any dialogue between us, no words, only dancing and kissing. Dancing is a cute term; was it snapping fingers and twirling dancing, or just bodies grinding up against each other in a crowded room? I wonder if kissing was just faces sloppily pressed up against each other? When the detective asked if he had planned on taking me back to his dorm, he said no. When the detective asked how we ended up behind the dumpster, he said he didn\u2019t know. He admitted to kissing other girls at that party, one of whom was my own sister who pushed him away. He admitted to wanting to hook up with someone. I was the wounded antelope of the herd, completely alone and vulnerable, physically unable to fend for myself, and he chose me. Sometimes I think, if I hadn\u2019t gone, then this never would\u2019ve happened. But then I realized, it would have happened, just to somebody else. You were about to enter four years of access to drunk girls and parties, and if this is the foot you started off on, then it is right you did not continue.","The night after it happened, he said he thought I liked it because I rubbed his back. A back rub. Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us speaking, a back rub.","One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don\u2019t remember, so how do I prove I didn\u2019t like it.","I thought there\u2019s no way this is going to trial; there were witnesses, there was dirt in my body, he ran but was caught. He\u2019s going to settle, formally apologize, and we will both move on. Instead, I was told he hired a powerful attorney, expert witnesses, private investigators who were going to try and find details about my personal life to use against me, find loopholes in my story to invalidate me and my sister, in order to show that this sexual assault was in fact a misunderstanding. That he was going to go to any length to convince the world he had simply been confused.","I was not only told that I was assaulted, I was told that because I couldn\u2019t remember, I technically could not prove it was unwanted. And that distorted me, damaged me, almost broke me. It is the saddest type of confusion to be told I was assaulted and nearly raped, blatantly out in the open, but we don\u2019t know if it counts as assault yet. I had to fight for an entire year to make it clear that there was something wrong with this situation.","When I was told to be prepared in case we didn\u2019t win, I said, I can\u2019t prepare for that. He was guilty the minute I woke up. No one can talk me out of the hurt he caused me. Worst of all, I was warned, because he now knows you don\u2019t remember, he is going to get to write the script. He can say whatever he wants and no one can contest it. I had no power, I had no voice, I was defenseless. My memory loss would be used against me. My testimony was weak, was incomplete, and I was made to believe that perhaps, I am not enough to win this. That\u2019s so damaging. His attorney constantly reminded the jury, the only one we can believe is Brock, because she doesn\u2019t remember. That helplessness was traumatizing.","Instead of taking time to heal, I was taking time to recall the night in excruciating detail, in order to prepare for the attorney\u2019s questions that would be invasive, aggressive, and designed to steer me off course, to contradict myself, my sister, phrased in ways to manipulate my answers. Instead of his attorney saying, Did you notice any abrasions? He said, You didn\u2019t notice any abrasions, right? This was a game of strategy, as if I could be tricked out of my own worth. The sexual assault had been so clear, but instead, here I was at the trial, answering question like:","How old are you? How much do you weigh? What did you eat that day? Well what did you have for dinner? Who made dinner? Did you drink with dinner? No, not even water? When did you drink? How much did you drink? What container did you drink out of? Who gave you the drink? How much do you usually drink? Who dropped you off at this party? At what time? But where exactly? What were you wearing? Why were you going to this party? What\u2019d you do when you got there? Are you sure you did that? But what time did you do that? What does this text mean? Who were you texting? When did you urinate? Where did you urinate? With whom did you urinate outside? Was your phone on silent when your sister called? Do you remember silencing it? Really because on page 53 I\u2019d like to point out that you said it was set to ring. Did you drink in college? You said you were a party animal? How many times did you black out? Did you party at frats? Are you serious with your boyfriend? Are you sexually active with him? When did you start dating? Would you ever cheat? Do you have a history of cheating? What do you mean when you said you wanted to reward him? Do you remember what time you woke up? Were you wearing your cardigan? What color was your cardigan? Do you remember any more from that night? No? Okay, we\u2019ll let Brock fill it in.","I was pummeled with narrowed, pointed questions that dissected my personal life, love life, past life, family life, inane questions, accumulating trivial details to try and find an excuse for this guy who didn\u2019t even take the time to ask me for my name, who had me naked a handful of minutes after seeing me. After a physical assault, I was assaulted with questions designed to attack me, to say see, her facts don\u2019t line up, she\u2019s out of her mind, she\u2019s practically an alcoholic, she probably wanted to hook up, he\u2019s like an athlete right, they were both drunk, whatever, the hospital stuff she remembers is after the fact, why take it into account, Brock has a lot at stake so he\u2019s having a really hard time right now.","And then it came time for him to testify. This is where I became revictimized. I want to remind you, the night after it happened he said he never planned to take me back to his dorm. He said he didn\u2019t know why we were behind a dumpster. He got up to leave because he wasn\u2019t feeling well when he was suddenly chased and attacked. Then he learned I could not remember.","So one year later, as predicted, a new dialogue emerged. Brock had a strange new story, almost sounded like a poorly written young adult novel with kissing and dancing and hand holding and lovingly tumbling onto the ground, and most importantly in this new story, there was suddenly consent. One year after the incident, he remembered, oh yeah, by the way she actually said yes, to everything, so.","He said he had asked if I wanted to dance. Apparently I said yes. He\u2019d asked if I wanted to go to his dorm, I said yes. Then he asked if he could finger me and I said yes. Most guys don\u2019t ask, Can I finger you? Usually there\u2019s a natural progression of things, unfolding consensually, not a Q and A. But apparently I granted full permission. He\u2019s in the clear.","Even in this story, there\u2019s barely any dialogue; I only said a total of three words before he had me half naked on the ground. I have never been penetrated after three words. He didn\u2019t claim to hear me speak one full sentence that night, so in the news when it says we \"met\", I\u2019m not sure I would go so far as to say that. Future reference, if you are confused about whether a girl can consent, see if she can speak an entire sentence. You couldn\u2019t even do that. Just one coherent string of words. If she can\u2019t do that, then no. Don\u2019t touch her, just no. Not maybe, just no. Where was the confusion? This is common sense, human decency.","According to him, the only reason we were on the ground was because I fell down. Note; if a girl falls help her get back up. If she is too drunk to even walk and falls, do not mount her, hump her, take off her underwear, and insert your hand inside her vagina. If a girl falls help her up. If she is wearing a cardigan over her dress don\u2019t take it off so that you can touch her breasts. Maybe she is cold, maybe that\u2019s why she wore the cardigan. If her bare ass and legs are rubbing the pinecones and needles, while the weight of you pushes into her, get off her.","Next in the story, two people approached you. You ran because you said you felt scared. I argue that you were scared because you\u2019d be caught, not because you were scared of two terrifying Swedish grad students. The idea that you thought you were being attacked out of the blue was ludicrous. That it had nothing to do with you being on top my unconscious body. You were caught red handed, with no explanation. When they tackled you why didn\u2019t [you] say, \"Stop! Everything\u2019s okay, go ask her, she\u2019s right over there, she\u2019ll tell you.\" I mean you had just asked for my consent, right? I was awake, right? When the policeman arrived and interviewed the evil Swede who tackled you, he was crying so hard he couldn\u2019t speak because of what he\u2019d seen. Also, if you really did think they were dangerous, you just abandoned a half-naked girl to run and save yourself. No matter which way you frame it, it doesn\u2019t make sense.","Your attorney has repeatedly pointed out, well we don\u2019t know exactly when she became unconscious. And you\u2019re right, maybe I was still fluttering my eyes and wasn\u2019t completely limp yet, fine. His guilt did not depend on him knowing the exact second that I became unconscious, that is never what this was about. I was slurring, too drunk to consent way before I was on the ground. I should have never been touched in the first place. Brock stated, \"At no time did I see that she was not responding. If at any time I thought she was not responding, I would have stopped immediately.\" Here\u2019s the thing; if your plan was to stop only when I was literally unresponsive, then you still do not understand. You didn\u2019t even stop when I was unconscious anyway! Someone else stopped you. Two guys on bikes noticed I wasn\u2019t moving in the dark and had to tackle you. How did you not notice while on top of me?","You said, you would have stopped and gotten help. You say that, but I want you to explain how you would\u2019ve helped me, step by step, walk me through this. I want to know, if those evil Swedes had not found me, how the night would have played out. I am asking you; Would you have pulled my underwear back on over my boots? Untangled the necklace wrapped around my neck? Closed my legs, covered me? Tucked my bra back into my dress? Would you have helped me pick the needles from my hair? Asked if the abrasions on my neck and bottom hurt? Would you then go find a friend and say, Will you help me get her somewhere warm and soft? I don\u2019t sleep when I think about the way it could have gone if the Swedes had never come. What would have happened to me? That\u2019s what you\u2019ll never have a good answer for, that\u2019s what you can\u2019t explain even after a year.","To sit under oath and inform all of us, that yes I wanted it, yes I permitted it, and that you are the true victim attacked by guys for reasons unknown to you is sick, is demented, is selfish, is stupid. It shows that you were willing to go to any length, to discredit me, invalidate me, and explain why it was okay to hurt me. You tried unyieldingly to save yourself, your reputation, at my expense.","My family had to see pictures of my head strapped to a gurney full of pine needles, of my body in the dirt with my eyes closed, dress hiked up, limbs limp in the dark. And then even after that, my family had to listen to your attorney say, the pictures were after the fact, we can dismiss them. To say, yes her nurse confirmed there was redness and abrasions inside her, but that\u2019s what happens when you finger someone, and he\u2019s already admitted to that. To listen to him use my own sister against me. To listen him attempt to paint of a picture of me, the seductive party animal, as if somehow that would make it so that I had this coming for me. To listen to him say I sounded drunk on the phone because I\u2019m silly and that\u2019s my goofy way of speaking. To point out that in the voicemail, I said I would reward my boyfriend and we all know what I was thinking. I assure you my rewards program is non-transferable, especially to any nameless man that approaches me.","The point is, this is everything my family and I endured during the trial. This is everything I had to sit through silently, taking it, while he shaped the evening. It is enough to be suffering. It is another thing to have someone ruthlessly working to diminish the gravity and validity of this suffering. But in the end, his unsupported statements and his attorney\u2019s twisted logic fooled no one. The truth won, the truth spoke for itself.","You are guilty. Twelve jurors convicted you guilty of three felony counts beyond reasonable doubt, that\u2019s twelve votes per count, thirty-six yeses confirming guilt, that\u2019s one hundred percent, unanimous guilt. And I thought finally it is over, finally he will own up to what he did, truly apologize, we will both move on and get better. Then I read your statement.","If you are hoping that one of my organs will implode from anger and I will die, I\u2019m almost there. You are very close. Assault is not an accident. This is not a story of another drunk college hookup with poor decision making. Somehow, you still don\u2019t get it. Somehow, you still sound confused.","I will now take this opportunity to read portions of the defendant\u2019s statement and respond to them.","You said, Being drunk I just couldn\u2019t make the best decisions and neither could she.","Alcohol is not an excuse. Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That\u2019s the difference.","You said, If I wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room.","I\u2019m not mad because you didn\u2019t ask for my number. Even if you did know me, I would not want [to] be in this situation. My own boyfriend knows me, but if he asked to finger me behind a dumpster, I would slap him. No girl wants to be in this situation. Nobody. I don\u2019t care if you know their phone number or not.","You said, I stupidly thought it was okay for me to do what everyone around me was doing, which was drinking. I was wrong.","Again, you were not wrong for drinking. Everyone around you was not sexually assaulting me. You were wrong for doing what nobody else was doing, which was pushing your erect dick in your pants against my naked, defenseless body concealed in a dark area, where partygoers could no longer see or protect me, and own my sister could not find me. Sipping fireball is not your crime. Peeling off and discarding my underwear like a candy wrapper to insert your finger into my body, is where you went wrong. Why am I still explaining this.","You said, During the trial I didn\u2019t want to victimize her at all. That was just my attorney and his way of approaching the case.","Your attorney is not your scapegoat, he represents you. Did your attorney say some incredulously infuriating, degrading things? Absolutely. He said you had an erection, because it was cold. I have no words.","You said, you are in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which you speak about your experience to \"speak out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that.\"","Speak out against campus drinking culture. That\u2019s what we\u2019re speaking out against? You think that\u2019s what I\u2019ve spent the past year fighting for? Not awareness about campus sexual assault, or rape, or learning to recognize consent. Campus drinking culture. Down with Jack Daniels. Down with Skyy Vodka. If you want talk to high school kids about drinking go to an AA meeting. You realize, having a drinking problem is different than drinking and then forcefully trying to have sex with someone? Show men how to respect women, not how to drink less.","Drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Goes along with that, like a side effect, like fries on the side of your order. Where does promiscuity even come into play? I don\u2019t see headlines that read, Brock Turner, Guilty of drinking too much and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that. Campus [Sexual] Assault. There\u2019s your first powerpoint slide.","I have done enough explaining. You do not get to shrug your shoulders and be confused anymore. You do not get to pretend that there were no red flags. You do not get to not know why you ran. You have been convicted of violating me with malicious intent, and all you can admit to is consuming alcohol. Do not talk about the sad way your life was upturned because alcohol made you do bad things. Figure out how to take responsibility for your own conduct.","Lastly you said, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin a life.","Ruin a life, one life, yours, you forgot about mine. Let me rephrase for you, I want to show people that one night of drinking can ruin two lives. You and me. You are the cause, I am the effect. You have dragged me through this hell with you, dipped me back into that night again and again. You knocked down both our towers, I collapsed at the same time you did. Your damage was concrete; stripped of titles, degrees, enrollment. My damage was internal, unseen, I carry it with me. You took away my worth, my privacy, my energy, my time, my safety, my intimacy, my confidence, my own voice, until today.","See one thing we have in common is that we were both unable to get up in the morning. I am no stranger to suffering. You made me a victim. In newspapers my name was \"unconscious intoxicated woman\", ten syllables, and nothing more than that. For a while, I believed that that was all I was. I had to force myself to relearn my real name, my identity. To relearn that this is not all that I am. That I am not just a drunk victim at a frat party found behind a dumpster, while you are the All-American swimmer at a top university, innocent until proven guilty, with so much at stake. I am a human being who has been irreversibly hurt, who waited a year to figure out if I was worth something.","My independence, natural joy, gentleness, and steady lifestyle I had been enjoying became distorted beyond recognition. I became closed off, angry, self-deprecating, tired, irritable, empty. The isolation at times was unbearable. You cannot give me back the life I had before that night either. While you worry about your shattered reputation, I refrigerated spoons every night so when I woke up, and my eyes were puffy from crying, I would hold the spoons to my eyes to lessen the swelling so that I could see. I showed up an hour late to work every morning, excused myself to cry in the stairwells, I can tell you all the best places in that building to cry where no one can hear you, the pain became so bad that I had to tell my boss I was leaving, I needed time because continuing day to day was not possible. I used my savings to go as far away as I could possibly be.","I can\u2019t sleep alone at night without having a light on, like a five year old, because I have nightmares of being touched where I cannot wake up, I did this thing where I waited until the sun came up and I felt safe enough to sleep. For three months, I went to bed at six o\u2019clock in the morning.","I used to pride myself on my independence, now I am afraid to go on walks in the evening, to attend social events with drinking among friends where I should be comfortable being. I have become a little barnacle always needing to be at someone\u2019s side, to have my boyfriend standing next to me, sleeping beside me, protecting me. It is embarrassing how feeble I feel, how timidly I move through life, always guarded, ready to defend myself, ready to be angry.","You have no idea how hard I have worked to rebuild parts of me that are still weak. It took me eight months to even talk about what happened. I could no longer connect with friends, with everyone around me. I would scream at my boyfriend, my own family whenever they brought this up. You never let me forget what happened to me. At the of end of the hearing, the trial, I was too tired to speak. I would leave drained, silent. I would go home turn off my phone and for days I would not speak. You bought me a ticket to a planet where I lived by myself. Every time a new article [would] come out, I lived with the paranoia that my entire hometown would find out and know me as the girl who got assaulted. I didn\u2019t want anyone\u2019s pity and am still learning to accept victim as part of my identity. You made my own hometown an uncomfortable place to be.","Someday, you can pay me back for my ambulance ride and therapy. But you cannot give me back my sleepless nights. The way I have broken down sobbing uncontrollably if I\u2019m watching a movie and a woman is harmed, to say it lightly, this experience has expanded my empathy for other victims. I have lost weight from stress, when people would comment I told them I\u2019ve been running a lot lately. There are times I did not want to be touched. I have to relearn that I am not fragile, I am capable, I am wholesome, not just livid and weak.","I want to say this. All the crying, the hurting you have imposed on me, I can take it. But when I see my younger sister hurting, when she is unable to keep up in school, when she is deprived of joy, when she is not sleeping, when she is crying so hard on the phone she is barely breathing, telling me over and over she is sorry for leaving me alone that night, sorry sorry sorry, when she feels more guilt than you, then I do not forgive you. That night I had called her to try and find her, but you found me first. Your attorney\u2019s closing statement began, \"My sister said she was fine and who knows her better than her sister.\" You tried to use my own sister against me. Your points of attack were so weak, so low, it was almost embarrassing. You do not touch her.","If you think I was spared, came out unscathed, that today I ride off into sunset, while you suffer the greatest blow, you are mistaken. Nobody wins. We have all been devastated, we have all been trying to find some meaning in all of this suffering.","You should have never done this to me. Secondly, you should have never made me fight so long to tell you, you should have never done this to me. But here we are. The damage is done, no one can undo it. And now we both have a choice. We can let this destroy us, I can remain angry and hurt and you can be in denial, or we can face it head on, I accept the pain, you accept the punishment, and we move on.","Your life is not over, you have decades of years ahead to rewrite your story. The world is huge, it is so much bigger than Palo Alto and Stanford, and you will make a space for yourself in it where you can be useful and happy. Right now your name is tainted, so I challenge you to make a new name for yourself, to do something so good for the world, it blows everyone away. You have a brain and a voice and a heart. Use them wisely. You possess immense love from your family. That alone can pull you out of anything. Mine has held me up through all of this. Yours will hold you and you will go on.","I believe, that one day, you will understand all of this better. I hope you will become a better more honest person who can properly use this story to prevent another story like this from ever happening again. I fully support your journey to healing, to rebuilding your life, because that is the only way you\u2019ll begin to help others.","Now to address the sentencing. When I read the probation officer\u2019s report, I was in disbelief, consumed by anger which eventually quieted down to profound sadness. My statements have been slimmed down to distortion and taken out of context. I fought hard during this trial and will not have the outcome minimized by a probation officer who attempted to evaluate my current state and my wishes in a fifteen minute conversation, the majority of which was spent answering questions I had about the legal system. The context is also important. Brock had yet to issue a statement, and I had not read his remarks.","My life has been on hold for over a year, a year of anger, anguish and uncertainty, until a jury of my peers rendered a judgment that validated the injustices I had endured. Had Brock admitted guilt and remorse and offered to settle early on, I would have considered a lighter sentence, respecting his honesty, grateful to be able to move our lives forward. Instead he took the risk of going to trial, added insult to injury and forced me to relive the hurt as details about my personal life and sexual assault were brutally dissected before the public. He pushed me and my family through a year of inexplicable, unnecessary suffering, and should face the consequences of challenging his crime, of putting my pain into question, of making us wait so long for justice.","I told the probation officer I do not want Brock to rot away in prison. I did not say he does not deserve to be behind bars. The probation officer\u2019s recommendation of a year or less in county jail is a soft time-out, a mockery of the seriousness of his assaults, and of the consequences of the pain I have been forced to endure. I also told the probation officer that what I truly wanted was for Brock to get it, to understand and admit to his wrongdoing.","Unfortunately, after reading the defendant\u2019s statement, I am severely disappointed and feel that he has failed to exhibit sincere remorse or responsibility for his conduct. I fully respected his right to a trial, but even after twelve jurors unanimously convicted him guilty of three felonies, all he has admitted to doing is ingesting alcohol. Someone who cannot take full accountability for his actions does not deserve a mitigating sentence. It is deeply offensive that he would try and dilute rape with a suggestion of promiscuity. By definition rape is the absence of promiscuity, rape is the absence of consent, and it perturbs me deeply that he can\u2019t even see that distinction.","The probation officer factored in that the defendant is youthful and has no prior convictions. In my opinion, he is old enough to know what he did was wrong. When you are eighteen in this country you can go to war. When you are nineteen, you are old enough to pay the consequences for attempting to rape someone. He is young, but he is old enough to know better.","As this is a first offense I can see where leniency would beckon. On the other hand, as a society, we cannot forgive everyone\u2019s first sexual assault or digital rape. It doesn\u2019t make sense. The seriousness of rape has to be communicated clearly, we should not create a culture that suggests we learn that rape is wrong through trial and error. The consequences of sexual assault needs to be severe enough that people feel enough fear to exercise good judgment even if they are drunk, severe enough to be preventative. The fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class.","The probation officer weighed the fact that he has surrendered a hard earned swimming scholarship. If I had been sexually assaulted by an un-athletic guy from a community college, what would his sentence be? If a first time offender from an underprivileged background was accused of three felonies and displayed no accountability for his actions other than drinking, what would his sentence be? How fast he swims does not lessen the impact of what happened to me.","The Probation Officer has stated that this case, when compared to other crimes of similar nature, may be considered less serious due to the defendant\u2019s level of intoxication. It felt serious. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.","He is a lifetime sex registrant. That doesn\u2019t expire. Just like what he did to me doesn\u2019t expire, doesn\u2019t just go away after a set number of years. It stays with me, it\u2019s part of my identity, it has forever changed the way I carry myself, the way I live the rest of my life.","A year has gone by and he has had lots of time on his hands. Has he been seeing a psychologist? What has he done in this past year to show he\u2019s been progressing? If he says he wants to implement programs, what has he done to show for it?","Throughout incarceration I hope he is provided with appropriate therapy and resources to rebuild his life. I request that he educates himself about the issue of campus sexual assault. I hope he accepts proper punishment and pushes himself to reenter society as a better person.","To conclude, I want to say thank you. To everyone from the intern who made me oatmeal when I woke up at the hospital that morning, to the deputy who waited beside me, to the nurses who calmed me, to the detective who listened to me and never judged me, to my advocates who stood unwaveringly beside me, to my therapist who taught me to find courage in vulnerability, to my boss for being kind and understanding, to my incredible parents who teach me how to turn pain into strength, to my friends who remind me how to be happy, to my boyfriend who is patient and loving, to my unconquerable sister who is the other half of my heart, to Alaleh, my idol, who fought tirelessly and never doubted me. Thank you to everyone involved in the trial for their time and attention. Thank you to girls across the nation that wrote cards to my DA to give to me, so many strangers who cared for me.","Most importantly, thank you to the two men who saved me, who I have yet to meet. I sleep with two bicycles that I drew taped above my bed to remind myself there are heroes in this story. That we are looking out for one another. To have known all of these people, to have felt their protection and love, is something I will never forget.","And finally, to girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought everyday for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you. Lighthouses don\u2019t go running all over an island looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining. Although I can\u2019t save every boat, I hope that by speaking today, you absorbed a small amount of light, a small knowing that you can\u2019t be silenced, a small satisfaction that justice was served, a small assurance that we are getting somewhere, and a big, big knowing that you are important, unquestionably, you are untouchable, you are beautiful, you are to be valued, respected, undeniably, every minute of every day, you are powerful and nobody can take that away from you. To girls everywhere, I am with you. Thank you."],"targetTitle":"Why Brock Turner is not actually a rapist","targetDescription":"There has been widespread outrage at the six-month sentence handed down to American student Brock Turner, following his conviction for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.

Ortuzar, who was then one of the chefs at Craft, \"was known for doing these great sandwiches after work and said hey, let\u2019s do a sandwich restaurant. And that\u2019s how 'Wichcraft was born,\" Colicchio told The Feast. Over the years, that little sandwich shop has grown into a ubiquitous chain\u2014which just opened its ninth branch and is opening its tenth in Grand Central this fall\u2014thanks to Colicchio and Ortuzar's knack for creating some of the most thrilling ingredient-driven sandwiches, soups and lunch offerings in NYC.","Tom Colicchio (right) with Sisha Ortuzar.","Still, as Colicchio himself admits, sometimes those lunch orders could take a little longer to prepare than a rushed and hungry customer might like. Now, with its brand-new location in Tribeca, Colicchio says the reconceived kitchen set-up will let the orders come out \"much faster.\" Its sandwiches, like the phenomenal BLT, will take an average of \"five minutes as opposed to 12-13 minutes,\" Colicchio said. The tweaking and rebranding of 'Wichcraft will soon spread to all shops in the chain, and Colicchio said he's hoping to expand 'Wichcraft to other cities in the near future. In the meantime, anyone who won't be visiting in person anytime soon can live vicariously through this must-try BLT recipe, which perfects the classic American sandwich.","The BLT is available starting August 1 at the new Tribeca location and all the 'Wichcraft shops. But for anyone trying the recipe at home, there's one crucial secret to making the sandwich come out perfectly, Colicchio says. \"If you\u2019re gonna make a BLT, you have to have great tomatoes, in season and fresh. Otherwise don\u2019t make it.\"","'Wichcraft BLT; Photo credit: Peden + Munk.","If you're like us, you'll be whipping up this sandwich multiple times a week, all the way through tomato season. In New York, that's typically August until early September, and that's the only time you'll find this BLT on 'Wichcraft's menu. (The sandwich shops use Eckerton Hill Farms tomatoes from the Union Square Greenmarket, along with Berkshire bacon.) After the season is over, it's not just the tomatoes that'll be gone. The sandwich will vanish too.","'Wichcraft BLT Recipe:","Makes 4 sandwiches","1 pound ripe heirloom or beefsteak tomatoes, sliced 1\u20442-inch thick (Tip: Sit the tomato stem side down on the counter and using a very sharp knife, slice it horizontally to prevent the juices from running out.)","1 pound thick-cut bacon","4 large leaves of Bibb lettuce","8 slices country bread","4 tablespoons aioli (see recipe below)","Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper","For the BLT:","In a heavy skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until golden brown and crisp on both sides. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Toast the bread on one side only. Evenly spread the aioli on the toasted side of four slices of bread. Place the tomatoes on top of the aioli, making sure the slices don\u2019t overlap and the surface of the bread is covered. Season the tomatoes with sea salt and pepper. Place the bacon over the tomatoes, followed by the lettuce. Close the sandwiches with the remaining four bread slices, toasted side down. Carefully cut into halves and serve.","For the aioli:","1 large egg yolk, preferably from a pasture-raised egg","1\u20442 teaspoon Dijon mustard","1\u20442 teaspoon chopped garlic","Pinch of cayenne pepper","1 tablespoon white wine vinegar","1 cup grapeseed oil","1\u20442 teaspoon kosher salt","Freshly ground black pepper","Place the egg yolk, mustard, garlic, cayenne pepper, and vinegar in a food processor or blender.

{"postId":"505545482979561_524488604418582","postText":["The interesting thing that happened when Kansas cut taxes and California hiked them"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders poses for a photograph with workers as he stops to eat at an In-N-Out Burger after a rally on June 3, 2016, in Pinole, Calif. (Photo by Matt McClain\/The Washington Post)","In 2012, voters in California approved a measure to raise taxes on millionaires, bringing their top state income tax rate to 13.3 percent, the highest in the nation. Conservative economists predicted calamity, or at least a big slowdown in growth. Also that year, the governor of Kansas signed a series of changes to the state's tax code, including reducing income and sales tax rates. Conservative economists predicted a boom.","Neither of those predictions came true. Not right away -- California grew just fine in the year the tax hikes took effect -- and especially not in the medium term, as new economic data showed this week.","Now, correlation does not, as they say, equal causation, and two examples are but a small sample. But the divergent experiences of California and Kansas run counter to a popular view, particularly among conservative economists, that tax cuts tend to supercharge growth and tax increases chill it.","California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth of the year. That was up from 3.1 percent growth for the Golden State in 2014, which was near the top of the national pack.","The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015. That's down from 1.2 percent in 2014, and below neighboring states such as Nebraska (2.1 percent) and Missouri (1.2 percent). Kansas ended the year with two consecutive quarters of negative growth -- a shrinking economy. By a common definition of the term, the state entered 2016 in recession.","[Kansas had the ultimate plan to punish the poor]","Other effects of the Kansas tax cuts, which were meant to spur entrepreneurship, are well-documented.","While state officials anticipated that the reductions would create a shortfall in the state budget, tax revenues have been consistently below even those expectations. Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s Investors Service have signaled that they could reduce Kansas\u2019s credit rating, indicating there is a chance the state cannot pay its bills.","The shortfalls have forced Gov. Sam Brownback (R) and lawmakers to make additional adjustments. The state canceled the initial reduction in sales taxes, then increased them again, while delaying additional scheduled reductions in the income tax.","On the whole, Brownback\u2019s policies modestly increased taxes for the poor and working class, who pay more in sales taxes than income taxes, while reducing taxes drastically for the rich.","The poorest 20 percent of households -- those making less than $23,000 a year -- are paying about $200 more, on average, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy in Washington. For the middle class, the changes have been a wash, with less-affluent households paying somewhat more and more-affluent households giving up a little less.","Meanwhile, the wealthiest 1 percent of households, those making at least $493,000 a year, are saving an average of $25,000.","[Bernie Sanders is right: The top 0.1 percent have as much as the bottom 90 percent]","Kansas\u2019s gross domestic product is still less than it was at the end of 2011, said Menzie Chinn, an economist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who has been following Kansas\u2019s economy. Meanwhile, the economy in the rest of the country continues to expand.","\"It\u2019s remarkable,\" Chinn said.","It is perhaps less remarkable -- or surprising -- that California has powered along. The recovery nationwide has favored massive metropolitan areas stocked with high-skilled workers, which is to say places such as Los Angeles, San Jose and San Francisco. The damage from California's deep housing crash has slowly healed in places such as the Central Valley.","Still, the noncoastal regions of California lag far behind Silicon Valley and Los Angeles in their job and growth recoveries. The state's median income remains below pre-recession levels after adjustment for inflation, although it still beats the national average.","[Will higher taxes on the rich derail California\u2019s economic comeback?]","Few, if any, economists would say today that the recovery has been sufficient for all Californians. But almost no one can say that raising taxes on the rich killed that recovery. Or that given a choice of the two states' economic performances over the past few years, you'd rather be Kansas."],"targetTitle":"The interesting thing that happened when Kansas cut taxes and California hiked them","targetDescription":"These two states must seem really bizarre to conservatives.","targetKeywords":"Post Keywords","targetMedia":["https:\/\/me.effectivemeasure.net\/em_image","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/washingtonpost_black_32.png","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_992x661\/2010-2019\/WashingtonPost\/2017\/03\/04\/Interactivity\/Images\/taxdelay-comp-hp.jpg","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_992x661\/2010-2019\/WashingtonPost\/2017\/03\/04\/Interactivity\/Images\/hp-schumer-putin.jpg","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/amsarkadium-a.akamaihd.net\/assets\/global\/game\/word-wipe\/7c5b0c76-a201-4eab-8106-403463686b14\/148x148.png&op=noop","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_1484w\/2010-2019\/WashingtonPost\/2016\/06\/03\/Others\/Images\/2016-06-03\/Sanders5651464997930.jpg","https:\/\/sb.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=3005617&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=1&h=1&filter=nearest&fmt=png","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/wp-eng-static.washingtonpost.com\/author_images\/tankersleyjc.jpg?ts=1413234852603&w=180&h=180","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/amsarkadium-a.akamaihd.net\/assets\/global\/game\/webgl-candy-mahjongg\/66600ba9-e698-4d41-8515-225e149a8781\/292x194.jpg&op=noop","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/spacer.gif&op=resize&w=3&h=2&filter=nearest&fmt=png","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/amsarkadium-a.akamaihd.net\/assets\/global\/game\/webgl-spider-solitaire\/74fed3ef-93c6-4925-b8bf-b08250534230\/292x194.jpg&op=noop","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/--kWdNhPKg8c\/UcIS6TF-cpI\/AAAAAAAAAys\/y2XWddUxAVk\/w714-h715-no\/Ehrenfreund.jpg&w=140&h=140&w=180&h=180","https:\/\/images.washingtonpost.com\/?url=https:\/\/amsarkadium-a.akamaihd.net\/assets\/80A67319-A53A-42DF-AFBE-56492553AF10\/game\/mahjongg-dimensions\/0a940cd6-fbf6-49e5-951e-24729023f2cc\/320X320.png&op=noop","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=http:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/news\/acts-of-faith\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/45\/2017\/03\/tony.jpg&w=1248&h=832","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/thewashingtonpost-white-2x.png","https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/pb\/resources\/img\/push_notifications\/notification_denied_v1.png","https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/wp-apps\/imrs.php?src=https:\/\/img.washingtonpost.com\/rf\/image_960w\/2010-2019\/WashingtonPost\/2016\/06\/03\/Others\/Images\/2016-06-03\/Sanders5651464997930.jpg&w=480"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2016\/06\/17\/one-state-raised-taxes-the-other-cut-them-guess-which-one-is-in-recession\/?campaign_id=A100&campaign_type=Email","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Kansas' economy suffered, California's economy grew. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - World News"},"spoiler":["California's economy grew by 4.1 percent in 2015, according to new numbers from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, tying it with Oregon for the fastest state growth","The Kansas economy, on the other hand, grew 0.2 percent in 2015.

Every neighborhood has its ramen shop at this point. Now, it has overtaken tobacco as the number one currency in US prisons, The Guardian reports.","According to a study done by Michael Gibson-Light, a doctoral candidate at the University of Arizona, decreasing quantity and a decline in quality of food served to US prisoners have made the food a commodity. And the noodles are being traded for a lot more than they\u2019re worth. At the prison used for the study, a package of ramen runs for 59 cents at the commissary, but at inmate stores, which are illegal, they can go for much more. A sweatshirt that costs $10.81 can be traded for two packs of ramen. Prisoners also clean each others bunks for packs of ramen, or gamble with it. The change is a signifier of a major problem with nutrition in prisons. \"[Money] doesn\u2019t change unless there\u2019s some drastic change to the value in people using it,\" Gibson-Light said.","He attributes ramen\u2019s popularity to the fact that it\u2019s \"easy to get\" and \"high in calories,\" something of value to people who \"spend their days working and exercising.\" They need the energy.","Ramen has been popular in prison for a long time. Gustavo \"Goose\" Alvarez who spent more than ten years in prison wrote a book about it called Prison Ramen: Recipes and Stories From Behind Bars. It includes recipes that can be made with items available to prisoners, such as tamales \"Doritos, canned pork and beans, and ramen,\" and celebrity ramen recipes.","It\u2019s not all trading and food hacks, though. When something is valuable and being traded on a sort of black market, things can get tricky. At inmate stores, people often buy things on credit. When credit isn\u2019t paid, it leads to problems. \"I\u2019ve seen fights over ramen,\" said one inmate. \"People get killed over soup.\"","[H\/T The Guardian]","Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com"],"targetTitle":"You Won\u2019t Believe the Food That Has Quickly Replaced Tobacco as The Most Popular Currency in US Prisons","targetDescription":"Who knew this common pantry item could be worth so much?","targetKeywords":"ramen,ramen prisons,ramen prisons tobacco,food,online,weird","targetMedia":["http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=9304643&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/static01.mediaite.com\/med\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Volume_tobacco-e1471881704388.jpg","http:\/\/static01.mediaite.com\/med\/wp-content\/themes\/m2015\/images\/logo.png","http:\/\/static01.mediaite.com\/med\/wp-content\/themes\/m2015\/images\/rss.png","https:\/\/d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net\/atrk.gif?account=wzNGo1IWhe104B","data:image\/png;base64, 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","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-41YeEX_ui4Qms.gif","http:\/\/static01.mediaite.com\/med\/wp-content\/themes\/m2015\/images\/promo-gossip.jpg","http:\/\/static01.mediaite.com\/med\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/ramen-college-250x163.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.mediaite.com\/online\/you-wont-believe-the-food-that-has-quickly-replaced-tobacco-as-the-most-popular-currency-in-us-prisons\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Ramen noodles. \n#StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Lifestyle"},"spoiler":["Ramen"],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,0],[0,5]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":371}

{"postId":"384228827633041408","postText":["And the richest state in the country is..."],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["From 24\/7 Wall St.","Last year, household income remained effectively unchanged, according to data released this week by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is despite the fact that the U.S. added nearly 2.2 million jobs in 2012.","\"The big story is that everything was stagnant over the year\" said Economic Policy Institute\u2019s Elise Gould. \"We\u2019re stagnant, and continue to be in a bad place.\"","While the economy continues to struggle, residents in the wealthiest states continue to make far more than in the poorest. In 2012, Maryland remained the richest state in the country, with a median household income of $71,221. Mississippi was again the poorest, with an income of $37,095 \u2014 nearly half that of Maryland\u2019s.","Despite the addition of jobs nationwide, median incomes remained stagnant in most states and were still generally below their 2008 levels, adjusted for inflation. Sheldon Danziger, president of the Russell Sage Foundation, explained that this has been the nature of the recovery. \"We have an economy that continues to grow, with most of the gains going to the economic elite. I don\u2019t see any bright prospects for the median worker, much less the poor.\"","States with lower median incomes generally had much higher rates of poverty than the national rate. All of the 10 states with the lowest median income in 2012 also had among the highest poverty rates in the country. While 15.9% of Americans fell below the poverty line in 2012, nearly one in four Mississippians did.","Employment is one of the biggest factors affecting income. In some states with lower unemployment, a higher share of the households had steady income, which bolsters the state\u2019s median. In many of the highest-income states, like New Hampshire, Minnesota and Hawaii, unemployment in 2012 was less than 6%, compared to a national rate of 8.1%.","Elise Gould, Director of Health Policy for Economic Policy Institute, explained that unemployment rates can have a significant effect on a state\u2019s household income. \"When we\u2019re talking about average families and poor families, the vast majority of income comes from wages. So it\u2019s about jobs.\" Gould cautioned, however, that unemployment rates do not tell the full story.","Unemployment rates, for example, ignore those people who have given up looking for work or accept part-time work. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, while 8.1% of American workers were unemployed in 2012, 14.7% were underemployed, meaning they wanted to work full time but could not. This was an increase from roughly 10% in 2008.","The types of jobs available in each state also affect income. A review of Census Bureau industry composition data shows that people in most of the states with a higher median income were often more likely to be employed in information, finance, professional and other positions that tend to pay higher salaries. Maryland, the wealthiest state in the country, had the highest percentage of workers in professional, scientific and management positions.","At the same time, many of the low-income states had smaller percentages of these professional occupations and higher rates of employment in retail, manufacturing and transportation. The high proportion of manufacturing jobs in low-income states might be surprising, but, explained Danziger, the makeup of the manufacturing industry in the country has changed.","\"There\u2019s a difference between unionized auto company workers and non-unionized parts suppliers,\" Danziger said. \"Even when manufacturers haven\u2019t cut wages, they are adopting labor-saving technological change.\"","To identify the states with the highest and lowest median household income, 24\/7 Wall St. reviewed state data on income from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2012 American Community Survey (ACS). Based on Census treatment, median household income for all years is adjusted for inflation. We also reviewed unemployment data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 2012, as well as 2012 ACS data on health insurance coverage, employment and poverty.","Here are America's richest states, according to 24\/7 Wall St."],"targetTitle":"The 10 Richest States In America: 24\/7 Wall St.","targetDescription":"From 24\/7 Wall St.","targetKeywords":"americas poorest states,video,america,richest states,states with the most money,wealthiest states,americas richest states","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1366946\/images\/o-CHRIS-CHRISTIE-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/318134\/slide_318134_2938366_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1gPLEb6","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Maryland with a median household income of $71221","spoilerPublisher":"HuffPoSpoilers"},"spoiler":["Maryland"],"spoilerPositions":[[[3,132],[3,140]]],"tags":["phrase"],"id":375}

{"postId":"170016066732231_171403133260191","postText":["You probably know to ask yourself, \"What do I want?\" Here\u2019s a way better question"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["Everybody wants what feels good. Everyone wants to live a carefree, happy and easy life, to fall in love and have amazing sex and relationships, to look perfect and make money and be popular and well-respected and admired and a total baller to the point that people part like the Red Sea when you walk into the room.","Everyone would like that\u2014it\u2019s easy to like that.","If I ask you, \"What do you want out of life?\" and you say something like, \"I want to be happy and have a great family and a job I like,\" it\u2019s so ubiquitous that it doesn\u2019t even mean anything.","A more interesting question, a question that perhaps you\u2019ve never considered before, is what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? Because that seems to be a greater determinant of how our lives turn out.","Everybody wants to have an amazing job and financial independence\u2014but not everyone wants to suffer through 60-hour work weeks, long commutes, obnoxious paperwork, to navigate arbitrary corporate hierarchies and the blase\u0301 confines of an infinite cubicle hell. People want to be rich without the risk, without the sacrifice, without the delayed gratification necessary to accumulate wealth.","Everybody wants to have great sex and an awesome relationship\u2014but not everyone is willing to go through the tough conversations, the awkward silences, the hurt feelings and the emotional psychodrama to get there. And so they settle. They settle and wonder \"What if?\" for years and years and until the question morphs from \"What if?\" into \"Was that it?\" And when the lawyers go home and the alimony check is in the mail they say, \"What was that for?\" if not for their lowered standards and expectations 20 years prior, then what for?","Because happiness requires struggle. The positive is the side effect of handling the negative. You can only avoid negative experiences for so long before they come roaring back to life.","At the core of all human behavior, our needs are more or less similar. Positive experience is easy to handle. It\u2019s negative experience that we all, by definition, struggle with. Therefore, what we get out of life is not determined by the good feelings we desire but by what bad feelings we\u2019re willing and able to sustain to get us to those good feelings.","People want an amazing physique. But you don\u2019t end up with one unless you legitimately appreciate the pain and physical stress that comes with living inside a gym for hour upon hour, unless you love calculating and calibrating the food you eat, planning your life out in tiny plate-sized portions.","People want to start their own business or become financially independent. But you don\u2019t end up a successful entrepreneur unless you find a way to appreciate the risk, the uncertainty, the repeated failures, and working insane hours on something you have no idea whether will be successful or not.","People want a partner, a spouse. But you don\u2019t end up attracting someone amazing without appreciating the emotional turbulence that comes with weathering rejections, building the sexual tension that never gets released, and staring blankly at a phone that never rings. It\u2019s part of the game of love. You can\u2019t win if you don\u2019t play.","What determines your success isn\u2019t \"What do you want to enjoy?\" The question is, \"What pain do you want to sustain?\" The quality of your life is not determined by the quality of your positive experiences but the quality of your negative experiences. And to get good at dealing with negative experiences is to get good at dealing with life.","There\u2019s a lot of crappy advice out there that says, \"You\u2019ve just got to want it enough!\"","Everybody wants something. And everybody wants something enough. They just aren\u2019t aware of what it is they want, or rather, what they want \"enough.\"","Because if you want the benefits of something in life, you have to also want the costs. If you want the beach body, you have to want the sweat, the soreness, the early mornings, and the hunger pangs. If you want the yacht, you have to also want the late nights, the risky business moves, and the possibility of pissing off a person or ten thousand.","If you find yourself wanting something month after month, year after year, yet nothing happens and you never come any closer to it, then maybe what you actually want is a fantasy, an idealization, an image and a false promise. Maybe what you want isn\u2019t what you want, you just enjoy wanting. Maybe you don\u2019t actually want it at all.","Sometimes I ask people, \"How do you choose to suffer?\" These people tilt their heads and look at me like I have twelve noses. But I ask because that tells me far more about you than your desires and fantasies. Because you have to choose something. You can\u2019t have a pain-free life. It can\u2019t all be roses and unicorns. And ultimately that\u2019s the hard question that matters. Pleasure is an easy question. And pretty much all of us have similar answers. The more interesting question is the pain. What is the pain that you want to sustain?","That answer will actually get you somewhere. It\u2019s the question that can change your life. It\u2019s what makes me me and you you. It\u2019s what defines us and separates us and ultimately brings us together.","For most of my adolescence and young adulthood, I fantasized about being a musician \u2014 a rock star, in particular. Any badass guitar song I heard, I would always close my eyes and envision myself up on stage playing it to the screams of the crowd, people absolutely losing their minds to my sweet finger-noodling. This fantasy could keep me occupied for hours on end. The fantasizing continued up through college, even after I dropped out of music school and stopped playing seriously. But even then it was never a question of if I\u2019d ever be up playing in front of screaming crowds, but when. I was biding my time before I could invest the proper amount of time and effort into getting out there and making it work. First, I needed to finish school. Then, I needed to make money. Then, I needed to find the time. Then ... and then nothing.","Despite fantasizing about this for over half of my life, the reality never came. And it took me a long time and a lot of negative experiences to finally figure out why: I didn\u2019t actually want it.","I was in love with the result\u2014the image of me on stage, people cheering, me rocking out, pouring my heart into what I\u2019m playing\u2014but I wasn\u2019t in love with the process. And because of that, I failed at it. Repeatedly. Hell, I didn\u2019t even try hard enough to fail at it. I hardly tried at all.","The daily drudgery of practicing, the logistics of finding a group and rehearsing, the pain of finding gigs and actually getting people to show up and give a shit. The broken strings, the blown tube amp, hauling 40 pounds of gear to and from rehearsals with no car. It\u2019s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn\u2019t like to climb much. I just liked to imagine the top.","Our culture would tell me that I\u2019ve somehow failed myself, that I\u2019m a quitter or a loser. Self-help would say that I either wasn\u2019t courageous enough, determined enough or I didn\u2019t believe in myself enough. The entrepreneurial\/start-up crowd would tell me that I chickened out on my dream and gave in to my conventional social conditioning. I\u2019d be told to do affirmations or join a mastermind group or manifest or something.","But the truth is far less interesting than that: I thought I wanted something, but it turns out I didn\u2019t. End of story.","I wanted the reward and not the struggle. I wanted the result and not the process. I was in love not with the fight but only the victory. And life doesn\u2019t work that way.","Who you are is defined by the values you are willing to struggle for. People who enjoy the struggles of a gym are the ones who get in good shape. People who enjoy long workweeks and the politics of the corporate ladder are the ones who move up it. People who enjoy the stresses and uncertainty of the starving artist lifestyle are ultimately the ones who live it and make it.","This is not a call for willpower or \"grit.\" This is not another admonishment of \"no pain, no gain.\"","This is the most simple and basic component of life: our struggles determine our successes. So choose your struggles wisely, my friend.","This post originally appeared on MarkManson.net.

{"postId":"622822026353475584","postText":["Paul Feig Reveals Character Names for the New 'Ghostbusters'"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Director Paul Feig has been revealing quite a bit from his forthcoming Ghostbusters reboot that\u2019s currently shooting in New York City. We\u2019ve already seen the new proton packs (with added specs to help cosplayers), the new Ecto-1, and a shot of Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones all suited up and ready to bust ghosts.","But we still didn\u2019t know what characters the ladies were playing. That changed yesterday when Feig replied to a request to reveal the character names on Twitter from a Ghostsbusters fan and charity organization. Find out the new Ghostbusters character names after the jump!","Here\u2019s what Feig wrote on Twitter:","Okay, here you go. Erin Gilbert, Jillian Holtzmann, Abby Yates and Patty Tolan. Now you know even more. https:\/\/t.co\/MsQVo5iStI \u2014 Paul Feig (@paulfeig) July 18, 2015","Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t match the names with each actress, but thanks to set photos that have glimpses of the nametags on each of the jumpsuits, fans have been able to determine who is playing who very quickly. Melissa McCarthy is Abby Yates, Kristen Wiig is Erin Gilbert, Kate McKinnon is Jillian Holtzmann and Leslie Jones is Patty Tolan.","Some fans have been trying to match up the new characters with the original Ghostbusters, Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Ray Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), Egon Spenger (Harold Ramis) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson). However, we have to keep in mind that this is a Ghostbusters reboot, and not a straight-up remake. So these characters won\u2019t have the exactsame traits as the original team.","As for the supporting cast, we already know some details about their characters. Andy Garcia is playing the mayor of New York City, Michael K. Williams is a character named Hawkins, Matt Walsh is a character named Rourke (I could easily see him working for the mayor), Chris Hemsworth is the new secretary for the Ghostbusters, and Saturday Night Live writer Neil Casey is the film\u2019s villain. And let\u2019s not forget that Dan Ayrkoyd also confirmed that he\u2019ll have a cameo in the film in a scene with Kristen Wiig.","Honestly, as someone who is a massive Ghostbusters fan (I have an entire wall with action figures and original artwork), this is something that I\u2019m not very worried about anymore. As with any reboot or remake, a new take on the material won\u2019t take away from how much I love the original movies. Furthermore, after finally seeing how surprisingly good and funny Spy was earlier this summer, I think Feig can pull this off.","Ghostbusters arrives next summer on July 22nd, 2016."],"targetTitle":"Paul Feig Reveals New Ghostbusters Character Names","targetDescription":"After revealing the proton packs, Ecto-1 and the cast suited up in full gear, Paul Feig has just revealed the new Ghostbusters character names too.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.slashfilm.com\/slashfilm\/wp\/wp-content\/images\/ghostbusters-reboot-castphoto-700x300.jpg","https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media2.slashfilm.com\/slashfilm\/siteimages\/authors\/35.jpg","http:\/\/sstatic1.histats.com\/0.gif?1648144&101","https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/media2.slashfilm.com\/slashfilm\/siteimages\/pm-comments.jpg","https:\/\/i0.wp.com\/media2.slashfilm.com\/slashfilm\/wp\/wp-content\/images\/ghostbusters-reboot-castphoto.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/bit.ly\/1RHrI1X","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Erin Gilbert, Jillian Holtzmann, Abby Yates and Patty Tolan.","spoilerPublisher":"SavedYouAClick"},"spoiler":["Melissa McCarthy is Abby Yates, Kristen Wiig is Erin Gilbert, Kate McKinnon is Jillian Holtzmann and Leslie Jones is Patty Tolan."],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,212],[4,341]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":380}

Their reasons may vary widely \u2014 from looking to lose weight to building muscle and getting chiseled. Some men even go to experience a place of solace; somewhere outside of the house and away from work where they can relax, hit the steam room, or just burn off some calories on the treadmill. But new research indicates there are actually body image issues at play driving more men to fitness centers than you might expect.","Body image issues aren\u2019t typically associated with men, though they are fairly widespread. According to a recent study published in Psychology of Men & Masculinity, as many as 20% to 40% of American men are struggling with body image problems in some shape or form. It shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise then, that a newer study has revealed such body image issues are spurring millions of men to hit the gym \u2014 even though many would probably never admit it.","Specifically, it\u2019s \"men\u2019s hidden fears about body fat\" that are driving gym attendance, according to a team of researchers from the University of Lincoln (U.K.) and Australia\u2019s Curtin University. The study says these men are motivated by \"feelings of guilt and shame rather than a desire to build muscle,\" which may come as a surprise to many \u2014 even men who may not be willing to admit it to themselves."],"targetTitle":"The Secret Reason So Many Men Go to the Gym","targetDescription":"Men go to the gym for a number of reasons: Building muscle and losing weight among them.

Wilder died at the age of 83 on Sunday, due to complications from Alzheimer\u2019s disease at his home in Stamford, Connecticut.","Without Wilder the film may have been good, but with him, it was wonderful. As it turns out, however, the actor wasn\u2019t always sold on the role. In fact, he only agreed to play the famous candyman under one condition.","As reported by Letters of Note, Wilder told Stuart:","\"When I make my first entrance. I\u2019d like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp. After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple, they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet. As I walk toward them, my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I\u2019m walking on and stands straight up, by itself; but I keep on walking, until I realize that I no longer have my cane. I start to fall forward, and just before I hit the ground, I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up, to great applause.\"","When asked why he wanted to do this, Wilder simply said, \"Because from that time on, no one will know if I\u2019m lying or telling the truth.\"","Wilder wanted Wonka to be completely unpredictable, and as we all know, he got his wish. The scene featuring Wonka\u2019s grand entrance is one of the most memorable in the film, thanks to Wilder\u2019s imagination and creativity.","Wilder also provided some input about Wonka\u2019s costume after seeing the first sketches. According to Letters of Note, the actor wrote a letter to Stuart offering up some suggestions for the character\u2019s signature look.","\"I don\u2019t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy\u2019s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric \u2014 where there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019ll do or where he ever found his get-up \u2014 except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another,\" he wrote, adding, \"A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste.

{"postId":"497233573045628928","postText":["The strange word everyone is saying\/texting"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Not long after noticing friends and coworkers using \"slash\" in everyday conversation, I started seeing it cropping up everywhere, all the time.","Either spelled out in five characters (\"slash\") or just one (\"\/\"), I saw it used to tack on subsequent ideas that could have been expressed in other, perfectly conventional ways. But they weren't.","It was invading texts, instant messages, email and even in-person dialogue. The slash was being vocalized where it might otherwise appear in written form, integrated smoothly into audible discussion. Since we aren't yet giving other punctuation the same treatment (\"Hello exclamation point\" still sounds odd), it didn't make much sense.","After so much time being delegated to such boring utilitarian functions as dates (\"8\/30\/2014\") and fractions (\"3\/4 cup\"), the humble slash mark seems to be getting a linguistic makeover. Anne Curzan, professor of English at the University of Michigan, described the practice among students in her classroom last year. Since then, Curzan told me in an email, she's been studying examples of slash usage on Twitter. The most common use corresponds most closely to \"and\/or,\" but she said a fair number are \"used to connect one idea to another, perhaps meaning something like 'following up' or as something like a spoken semi-colon.\" Still, other examples use the slash as a way to indicate \"truth values for the elements it connects,\" Curzan explained. In other words, saying one thing when what you really mean is the next. Like saying you need to rest when what you're really planning is binge-watching TV.","Grammatically speaking, outside of its role as punctuation, the slash also functions as a \"coordinator.\" Coordinators, also called coordinating conjunctions, include \"and,\" \"but,\" \"or\" and other words that function to link independent and dependent clauses.","English speakers are pretty comfortable with this idea, as Geoffrey K. Pullum, professor of linguistics at the University of Edinburgh, explained on his blog back in 2010. For example, we might invite our friend\/roommate to go see \"Boyhood\" while planning to stuff our purse\/backpack\/pockets with cheap candy. Our meaning is clear. The person with whom we share a responsibility for rent is also our friend, and whatever discreet container we bring to the theater will help us avoid paying five dollars for a box of Sour Patch Kids. The slash helps us present alternative descriptions. Pullum suggested, however, that it really only makes sense in \"lexical rather than phrasal categories.\"","\"With clauses,\" he wrote, \"I think there is no possibility of using it at all: consider 'I think I'm having hallucinations slash someone is playing tricks on me.' Doesn't seem like English at all, does it?\" These days, many English speakers would disagree. Curzan explicitly noted that the slash can now be used to connect full clauses.","\"The most interesting implication to me,\" she said, \"is that this coordinator is expanding in use ... and taking on new meanings.\"","Usage guidelines are, of course, still very restrictive in formal writing. When the style guides and writers' handbooks I consulted mentioned the slash at all, they called it \"rarely necessary.\" A 1977 edition of Theodore Bernstein's \"The Careful Writer\" referred to the simple \"and\/or\" as \"a visual and mental monstrosity that should be avoided.\"","Tell that to anyone who considers themselves a \"slash DJ,\" to indicate their interest in the turntable arts outside of a regular nine-to-five. (Writer-slash-DJ. Financial-consultant-slash-DJ. Animal-whisperer-slash-DJ.) Or to Jezebel editor Kara Brown, who described Robin Thicke's \"Paula\" as the singer's \"most recent album slash lame ass attempt at gaining publicity saving his marriage.\"","While it'd be difficult to pin down exactly why we started going slash-crazy, it sure seems to correspond nicely with our culture of digital communication. Abbreviated by a lack of time or screen space or both, our technology has allowed instant messaging to flourish, so we might make our always-important thoughts known as quickly as possible.","The slash works as a stand-in, whether written or spoken, helping the writer express multiple ideas without going through the trouble of stringing them together using appropriate grammar, or else risking a series of awkwardly short bullet-point sentences. However strange \"I'm going for a run slash walk in the park\" sounds to your ear, it gets across the same basic message as the much wordier alternative, \"I'm going to run in the park but probably do a fair amount of walking, too, because running is hard.\" Using \"slash\" assigned more \"truth value\" to \"walk\" over \"run.\" The slash gives us a perfect opportunity to say two or more things at once like this, especially if one or more of those things is our own unsolicited snarky commentary. (\"Friendship slash rivalry.\" \"Review slash indictment.\")","In digital scenarios where time is of the essence, it might seem counterintuitive that typing \"slash\" in the written form would so often take the place of the shorter and equally comprehensible \"and\" or \"or\" if convenience is such a concern. So maybe it speaks, then, to our comfort with digital communication tools like keyboards and touch screens.

Sure, you\u2019ve got 16-ish hours away from the job each day, but is that enough time to enjoy all your personal, family, community, and social commitments without becoming a harried, frazzled unproductive mess? An ongoing study out of Sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity.","By knocking off 10 hours of work each week for a year, employees at a Swedish nursing home were able to improve their health, cut back on sick leave, and enhance the care of their charges, The New York Times reports.","Under the experiment, which focused on the future of work in Gothenburg, employees began working six-hour days at the same pay rate as their previous eight-hour days.","One employee says that after just one week he was more energized and residents said their standard of care had improved.","\"What\u2019s good is that we\u2019re happy,\" one employee tells the Times. \"And a happy worker is a better worker.\"","While workers reported feeling better about the jobs and their contribution, employers that took part in the experiment found a 30-hour work week sharply reduced absenteeism, improved productivity, enhanced creativity, and reduced turnover.","\"We\u2019ve had 40 years of a 40-hour workweek, and now we\u2019re looking at a society with higher sick leave and early retirement,\" Daniel Bernmar, leader of the political party running the trial, said. \"We want a new discussion in Sweden about how work life should be to maintain a good welfare state for the next 40 years.\"","The owner of a start-up in Stockholm, which operates on a six-hour day but didn\u2019t take part in the study, says the shorter days have assisted the small company to double its revenue and profit for the past three years.","\"We thought doing a shorter workweek would mean we\u2019d have to hire more, but it hasn\u2019t resulted in that because everyone works more efficiently,\" the owner tells the Times. \"Since we work fewer hours, we are constantly figuring out ways to do more with our time.\"","Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg tried a similar trial last year. The hospital\u2019s orthopedics unit switched 89 nurses and doctors to a six-hour day. But unlike the start-up, it had to hire 15 additional workers.","While the trial initially cost the hospital an additional $123,000 a month, it reduced sick calls, and increased the efficiency of the healthcare workers.","Although the tests have been helpful to both participating companies and employees, the concept hasn\u2019t been greeted with open arms by everyone.","Some opponents of the option contend that the country\u2019s economy would suffer from reduced competitiveness and strained finances, the Times reports.","\"We can\u2019t pay people to not work,\" Maria Ryde\u0301n, Gothenburg\u2019s deputy mayor, who is working to put an end to the trial, tells the Times.","In Sweden, an Experiment Turns Shorter Workdays Into Bigger Gains [The New York Times]"],"targetTitle":"Are Shorter Work Days Better For Your Health & Productivity?","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/07\/footer-logo.png?w=300","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/plugins\/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom\/vip-powered-wpcom\/images\/vip-powered-light-small.png","https:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/consumerist2\/images\/logo-small.jpg","https:\/\/consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/09\/consumer-reports-logo.png","https:\/\/s2.wp.com\/wp-content\/mu-plugins\/post-flair\/sharing\/images\/loading.gif","https:\/\/consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/05\/7746774628_7f92e2edd6_b.jpg"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/consumerist.com\/2016\/05\/23\/are-shorter-work-days-better-for-your-health-productivity\/","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Yes","spoilerPublisher":"savedyouaclick"},"spoiler":["An ongoing study out of Sweden seems to indicate that a shorter work day may actually result in more productivity."],"spoilerPositions":[[[0,337],[0,451]]],"tags":["passage"],"id":390}

Alternatively upgrade to a modern browser.","Why would a set of supporters try to stop a game while their team is winning? And why would they then start a fight among themselves?","They are natural questions to ask, but not easy to answer. This is the background, though. A lot of people in Croatia have become alienated from the national team in recent years and there are large movements that have given up on it completely.","They claim to have lost faith in the Croatian Football Federation and have accused it of widespread corruption. The federation\u2019s vice-president, Zdravko Mamic, has been charged with embezzling money from Dinamo Zagreb when he was chief executive there. Damir Vrbanovic, the federation\u2019s executive director, has also been charged as an accomplice in the same case.","Last year, they were taken into custody (Mamic twice, as the investigation extended) amid fears that someone was trying to influence witnesses. Finally, Mamic was suspended from working at Dinamo by the authorities but both men kept their job at the federation and were both in the VIP lounge at the game against the Czechs.","Many fans in Croatia feel the national team has been hijacked by the pair \u2013 as well as Davor Suker, the CFF president who is seen by many as their puppet \u2013 and turned it into a tool for making money. Mamic and Vrbanovic deny this but there has been a long \u2013 and at the moment unsuccessful \u2013 campaign to have them removed via the legal system.","Croatia fans fight among themselves following the disruption to Friday\u2019s match.","Some radical fans are so captivated by the hatred towards the CFF that they do not even mind if they are hurting the team with their actions. In fact, it goes further than that. They are now actively trying to sabotage the team, as they feel that international shame and on-pitch failure is the only chance for changes to finally take place in Croatian football.","Their aim may be to introduce more democracy and transparency in domestic football, a chance to start afresh, but their methods are all wrong. Other fans, who still support the team, started a scuffle with them in the stands after the flares were thrown. It is a sad indictment of the whole society that it has come to this.","Among the players and coaching staff on Friday night the sense was one of utter disillusionment.

{"postId":"800048986762423_802462623187726","postText":["3 Things To Know About the Future of Virtual Reality"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["Delegates use the Gear VR (virtual reality) headset, manufactured by Samsung Electronics Co., at the Samsung Unpacked launch event ahead of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016.","Strap on a rectangular black headset, and you can traverse a sunken ship at the bottom of the ocean or climb to the top of a snowcapped mountain. That's the promise of virtual reality (VR) headsets, like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.","As impressive as the technology already is, many believe it's still in its early days. That's because previous virtual reality-style efforts have flopped in the past. (Nintendo's Virtual Boy comes to mind.) But the latest crop of gadgets are seen as more promising, thanks to their much-improved graphics, head-tracking abilities and more.","Few have watched virtual reality evolve as closely as the companies building the hardware that powers it. TIME sat down with Frank Azor, general manager of the Dell-owned gaming PC manufacturer Alienware, and Nelson Gonzalez, Alienware's cofounder and former CEO, to discuss what they have learned about VR and where they believe it's headed. Below are the key highlights from our conversation.","Virtual reality will get more physical","Anyone who's seen or tried the HTC Vive knows that some physical activity is involved. The Vive and its two controllers are equipped with sensors that allow players to swing a virtual golf club or wield an imaginary paintbrush.","But what systems like the Vive or PlayStation VR currently lack is a sense of touch. Although it may look like you're swinging a golf club, the device in your hand still feels like a video game controller. (The Oculus Rift doesn't yet support any motion controllers, although the company plans to launch such devices later in 2016.) This is going to be one of the first areas in which virtual reality will improve, says Gonzalez.","\"The next evolution of VR would be where you participate physically in that VR world,\" Gonzalez said. \"And not just sitting down; if you're a quarterback, you actually get to throw a football, and you can interface with the team. So that kind of stuff, it's there, it's going to happen.\"","Incorporating better touch controls will only be the start. Azor believes future VR devices could refine concepts first introduced as far back as 1962 with the Sensorama , which incorporated elements like wind and smells.","\"Headsets today are doing an excellent job at catering to your visual senses, and a little bit of audio as well,\" said Azor, also Alienware's fourth employee. \"Well that's just two of the senses . . . Once you begin catering to the rest of the senses, like what we feel body-wise, temperature-wise, and smell, the reality factor of virtual reality [becomes] stronger and the virtual piece begins to fade.\"","It's unclear exactly how \u2014 and if \u2014 technologies like those Azor described will ever take shape. But some companies are certainly trying. Leap Motion, a startup which launched a motion-sensing camera for computers in 2013, is now building technology for interacting with VR environments without a controller. Startup Thalmic Labs also makes an armband capable of controlling electronic devices through gestures that works with the Rift.","VR is an industry-wide effort","The Oculus Rift will likely be remembered as the first modern virtual reality headset. But it takes more than just one device to impact the industry in a meaningful way, says Azor.","Azor draws comparisons to the way the gaming industry developed over the past decade. PCs became better equipped to deliver high-end gaming experiences as companies like Intel, AMD, and Nvidia developed more powerful chips and graphics processors. Games became more accessible on PCs as companies like Steam created platforms for easily buying and browsing content.","\"Everyone rallied around [the PC gaming] industry and now we have what we have today,\" he said. \"VR is the same type of thing; no one company can solve all of the problems.\"","A wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon","There are two classes of virtual reality devices available today: cheaper, portable devices like the Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard, and beefier, expensive systems that offer more immersive experiences like the Rift and the Vive. The former plug into your smartphone to deliver VR that's wireless and convenient, while the latter must be tethered to a PC to power their higher-end performance.","It's unlikely that we'll see a high-performance device like the Rift go wireless anytime soon, mostly because wireless technology isn't advancing at the same pace as VR hardware.","\"By the time we solve that, as an industry we're going to want to give you version two of the product, which is going to become the new benchmark,\" Azor said. \"Wireless technology is on a different schedule, that's where the issue comes in . . . The latest and greatest will be wired for a fair amount of time moving forward.\""],"targetTitle":"3 Things To Know About the Future of Virtual Reality","targetDescription":"We spoke with the team at gaming PC brand Alienware about what's next for VR.","targetKeywords":"Oculus Rift vs. HTC Vive, Alienware Oculus ready PCs, Alienware interview, virtual reality, vr","targetMedia":["data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?w=1100&quality=85","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/gettyimages-511577070.jpg?w=720"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/time.com\/4324598\/alienware-interview-virtual-reality\/?xid=time_socialflow_facebook","provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":"Virtual reality will get more physical, will become and industry-wide effort, and a wireless Rift or Vive won\u2019t happen soon. #StopClickBait","spoilerPublisher":"Stop Clickbait - Gaming"},"spoiler":["Virtual reality will get more physical","VR is an industry-wide effort","A wireless Rift or Vive won't happen soon"],"spoilerPositions":[[[4,0],[4,38]],[[11,0],[11,29]],[[15,0],[15,41]]],"tags":["multi"],"id":393}

For the Dreamliner, Boeing cut that down to 6,000 feet.","\"To lower the cabin altitude, we actually increased the air pressure inside the cabin,\" Emery added. \"It's a bit counterintuitive for most people.\"","Why does air pressure matter to passengers?\u200b","For most of us, a long flight is usually followed by some combination of symptoms that include headaches, lack of appetite, lack of energy, nausea, and sleeplessness.","All of these afflictions have been conveniently bundled together with a disruption of one's internal body clock to form something we call jet lag.","But the reality is that jet lag is far more serious.","The very symptoms we attribute to jet lag may actually be attributed to acute mountain sickness, which affects individuals exposed to altitudes above 6,500 feet.","In a study conducted by Oklahoma State University with the help of Boeing, researchers wrote:","\"Some passengers on long commercial flights experience discomfort characterized by symptoms similar to those of acute mountain sickness. The symptoms are often attributed to factors such as jet lag, prolonged sitting, dehydration, or contamination of cabin air. However, because barometric pressures in aircraft cabins are similar to those at the terrestrial altitudes at which acute mountain sickness occurs, it is possible that some of the symptoms are related to the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and are manifestations of acute mountain sickness.\"","In 2015 Boeing annouced it had made the lightest metal ever","The study found that passengers who go from sea level up to 8,000 feet of altitude saw the oxygen content in their blood fall 4%. Although this didn't trigger full on acute mountain sickness, it did bring on what the study called \"increased prevalence of discomfort after three to nine hours\" of exposure.","\"The research showed passengers' bodies reacted at 6,000 feet similar to that at sea level,\" Emery said. \"So we decided to pressurize the Dreamliner at 6,000 feet.\"","At 6,000 feet, the cabin air is more dense and has a greater level of oxygen saturation. As result, the body does not have to work as hard to oxygenate blood and sustain itself.","According to Emery, since there isn't a perfect one-to-one correlation between altitude and jet lag, Boeing has taken additional measures to mitigate the symptoms. These measures include an increase in cabin humidity as well as a new air-filtration system.","Why haven't we had this all along?","The Dreamliner won't be the only Boeing jet to have a have a lower cabin altitude. The company's upcoming 777X wide-body mini-jumbo jet will also be pressurized at 6,000 feet.","However, unlike the composite Dreamliner, the 777X, Boeing's successor to landmark 777, will be primarily made of aluminum.","\"Aluminum aircraft can be pressurized to 6,000 feet,\" Kent Craver, Boeing Commercial Airplanes regional director of passenger satisfaction, told Business Insider in an interview. \"In fact, most business jets are already pressurized to that level.\"","In addition, Airbus is also working to lower the cabin altitude on its next generation of airliners.","Airplane makers have traditionally avoided lowering the cabin altitude because boosting the air pressure inside the cabin puts greater stress on aluminum airframes. This increases the likelihood of metal fatigue and shortens the service life of the airplane.","However, Boeing believes it can successfully lower cabin altitude on the 777X without going to a composite body.","\"We know the 777 fuselage, its structural qualities, and its fatigue margins really well,\" a Boeing spokesperson told us in an email. \"We also understand the requirements of the lower cabin altitude in terms of cycles and pressures on the fuselage. As a result, we can achieve it with a few local reinforcements and change those loads out to accommodate lower cabin altitude.\"","The Boeing 777X is set to enter service in 2019."],"targetTitle":"Boeing is making a major change to its planes that could solve the biggest problem with air travel","targetDescription":"During the development of the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing encountered countless engineering hurdles.

Last month it promised that it\u2019ll ban any cheaters or hackers in Overwatch, and there will be no second chances provided.","Fast forward to now, only a few days after the game\u2019s official launch, and it\u2019s already coming good on its promise by banning thousands of Overwatch players.","Anyone using Overwatch cheat programs are being banned by Blizzard, and the company unleashed a massive ban wave yesterday that forced the program\u2019s creators to actually shut down the servers until they figure out how to bypass Blizzard\u2019s security.","That\u2019s not all, however. A PC Gamer report mentions that Blizzard is banning cheaters not only once, but several times. This means if you\u2019ve cheated, buying a new copy might not be enough. Several users are reporting that Blizzard banned them again after they bought a new copy. A few even tried buying a 3rd copy and yet they got banned within 24 hours of playing the game.","Blizzard\u2019s even taken a more brutal stance in China. The company, along with its partner NetEase, has ensured it bans anyone stupid enough to try cheating in the game. It unleashed a massive 1572 person ban wave earlier today. The company went a step ahead as far as savagery is concerned and revealed all the names it had banned due to cheating.","The moral of this story is clear as day, and it\u2019s that you should not even think about cheating while playing Overwatch. No matter how smart you think you are, it\u2019ll only end in one result, and that\u2019s getting banned not once, but possibly forever.

These nine countries are looking forward to a four-day festival filled with weirdness. ","Self-crucifixion: Philippines","On Good Friday devoted Catholics across the Philippines line up to take part in re-enactments of Christ\u2019s crucifixion, complete with self-flagellation and cross dragging. The city of San Fernando holds a passion play, culminating in the actual nailing of at least three devotees to wooden crosses in front of spectators. The Catholic Church has tried to dissuade followers from the practise and the Department of Health suggests participants should get a Tetanus shot and use sterilised nails.","Bunny killing: New Zealand","Fluffy rabbits may be synonymous with spring birth and joy but in Central Otago, New Zealand they are classed as crop destroying pests. An annual competition, now in its 26th year, recruits teams of hunters to participate in a 24 hour \u2018shoot-off\u2019 with the aim of killing as many bunnies as possible. The record currently stands at 23,000.","Clay pot throwing: Corfu","As church bells ring to mark the end of mass on Easter Saturday, residents of Corfu hurl clay pots off their balconies to loudly celebrate that death has been beaten by the Resurrection. The tradition was inspired by the Venetians, who threw their old and unwanted possessions out of their windows on New Year\u2019s Day. It was adopted by the islanders and applied to the most important day in their calendar.","Inter-church rocket war: Chios","Churches across Greece celebrate midnight mass with a fireworks display but the island of Chios takes it to the next level with two rival churches engaging in a \u2018rocket war\u2019 or Rouketopolemos. The parishes of St. Mark's and Panaghia Ereithiani are built on hilltops 400 metres from each other and they fire hundreds of homemade rockets at the opposition\u2019s belfry throughout the night. Direct hits to the bell tower are counted the next morning when the winner is declared.","Hill burning: Texas","Residents of Fredericksburg dress up as Easter Bunnies, pioneers and Comanches and parade through their tiny town before setting the hills surrounding it on fire. As the fires blaze the towns\u2019 lights are lowered as part of the Easter Fires Pageant. The ceremony began in 1847 to celebrate the peace accord signed between German settlers and Native Americans.","Sprinting Virgin Mary: Italy","The procession of La Madonna Che Scappa (The Dashing Madonna) is held on Easter Sunday in Sulmona, in the Abruzzo region of Southern Italy. Followers carry statues of the Risen Christ, Saint John and Saint Peter to the Church of San Filippo Neri to announce the news of the Resurrection to the mourning Madonna of Loreto. After persuasion from the saints the Madonna slowly moves out and then suddenly dashes to meet her son, with the sound of firecrackers accompanying her sprint.","Ultra omelette: France","Villagers in Haux, Gironde embark on their yearly quest to feed all 1,000 residents with a giant omelette on Easter Monday. On a hand built fire in the town square chefs use 5,000 eggs and 110 pounds of bacon, onion, and garlic to create the 10 ft wide dish. The village feast has only been an annual event for 30 years but many trace it back to a tale that Napoleon demanded a giant egg dish be prepared for his troops as they passed through the countryside. ","Wet Monday: Slovakia","On Wet Monday dedicated men follow the ancient tradition of dumping a bucket of cold water over an unsuspecting young woman when she answers her front door. This Slovak gem is said to bless the soaked individual with fertility and strength. The men are then invited in and rewarded with dyed eggs, money and vodka.","Halloween in spring: Sweden","On Maundy Thursday, Swedish children don face paint and grab broomsticks to dress up as witches and go door-to-door asking for sweets. According to Swedish legend, witches visited the forest of Blakulla before Easter, to party with the devil as he held his earthy court."],"targetTitle":"Nine of the weirdest Easter traditions around the world: From bunny hunting to real crucifixions","targetDescription":"Already bored of hot cross buns and egg hunts?

{"postId":"854461550744219649","postText":["He created a database to \"figure out what the government really does with the money.\" What he found surprised him"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Guess what Steven A. Ballmer has been up to for the last several years. (No, not just cheering for the basketball team he owns, the Los Angeles Clippers.) It\u2019s a novel project, and he plans to take the wrapping off it Tuesday.","But first the back story, which is a valuable prelude to a description of the project itself.","When Mr. Ballmer retired as chief executive of Microsoft in 2014, he was only 57 and quickly realized \"I don\u2019t, quote, \u2018have anything to do.\u2019\"","As he looked for a new endeavor \u2014 before he decided to buy the Clippers \u2014 his wife, Connie, encouraged him to help with some of her philanthropic efforts, an idea he initially rejected.","\"But come on, doesn\u2019t the government take care of the poor, the sick, the old?\" Mr. Ballmer recalled telling her. After all, he pointed out, he happily paid a lot of taxes, and he figured that all that tax money should create a sufficient social safety net.","Her answer: \"A, it won\u2019t, because there are things government doesn\u2019t get to, and B, you\u2019re missing it.\"","Mr. Ballmer replied, \"No, I\u2019m not.\"","That conversation led Mr. Ballmer to pursue what may be one of the most ambitious private projects undertaken to answer a question that has long vexed the public and politicians alike. He sought to \"figure out what the government really does with the money,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"What really happens?\"","On Tuesday, Mr. Ballmer plans to make public a database and a report that he and a small army of economists, professors and other professionals have been assembling as part of a stealth start-up over the last three years called USAFacts. The database is perhaps the first nonpartisan effort to create a fully integrated look at revenue and spending across federal, state and local governments.","Want to know how many police officers are employed in various parts of the country and compare that against crime rates? Want to know how much revenue is brought in from parking tickets and the cost to collect? Want to know what percentage of Americans suffer from diagnosed depression and how much the government spends on it? That\u2019s in there. You can slice the numbers in all sorts of ways.","Mr. Ballmer calls it \"the equivalent of a 10-K for government,\" referring to the kind of annual filing that companies make.","\"You know, when I really wanted to understand in depth what a company was doing, Amazon or Apple, I\u2019d get their 10-K and read it,\" he told me in a recent interview in New York. \"It\u2019s wonky, it\u2019s this, it\u2019s that, but it\u2019s the greatest depth you\u2019re going to get, and it\u2019s accurate.\"","In an age of fake news and questions about how politicians and others manipulate data to fit their biases, Mr. Ballmer\u2019s project may serve as a powerful antidote. Using his website, USAFacts.org, a person could look up just about anything: How much revenue do airports take in and spend? What percentage of overall tax revenue is paid by corporations? At the very least, it could settle a lot of bets made during public policy debates at the dinner table.","\"I would like citizens to be able to use this to form intelligent opinions,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"People can disagree about what to do \u2014 I\u2019m not going to tell people what to do.\" But, he said, people ought to base their opinions \"on common data sets that are believable.\"","So how exactly does one go about collecting and ordering the nation\u2019s data?","Before he started, Mr. Ballmer was convinced someone must have already done this.","His first instinct, naturally, was to go to a search engine. \"My favorite one, of course: I go to Bing,\" he said. \"And by the way, I check it with Google, just to make sure there\u2019s nothing I\u2019m missing.\"","But neither option led him to what he was looking for.","\"You\u2019ve got to look at federal, state and local together,\" Mr. Ballmer said. \"Because I\u2019m a citizen, I don\u2019t care whether I give my money to A, B or C. I just want to know how it lands, how it impacts what\u2019s going on.\"","With an unlimited budget, he went about hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and made a grant to the University of Pennsylvania to help his staff put the information together. Altogether, he has spent more than $10 million between direct funding and grants.","\"Let\u2019s say it costs three, four, five million a year,\" he said. \"I\u2019m happy to fund the damn thing.\"","For Mr. Ballmer, the experience has been worth every cent simply for the surprises that he has discovered looking at the data.","\"I love this one!\" he said, showing me a slide of information about government employees. \"Don\u2019t look, don\u2019t look!\" He instructed me to cover my eyes from the number at the bottom of the page.","\"How many people work for government in the United States?\" he asked, with the excitement of a child showing off a new toy, before displaying the answer. \"Almost 24 million. Would you have guessed that?\"","\"Then people say, \u2018Those damn bureaucrats!\u2019\" Mr. Ballmer exclaimed, channeling the criticism that government is bloated and filled with waste, fraud and abuse. \"Well, let\u2019s look at that. People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.\" And they represent almost half of the 24 million, his data shows.","\"And you say, O.K., what are the other big blocks?\" Mr. Ballmer continued. \"Well, active-duty military, war fighters. Government hospitals. Really? I didn\u2019t know that.\"","Suddenly, he explained, the faceless bureaucrats who are often pilloried as symbols of government waste start to look like the people in our neighborhood whom we\u2019re very glad to have.","\"Now people might not think they\u2019re government employees, but your tax dollars are helping somehow to pay 24 million people \u2014 and most of these people you like,\" Mr. Ballmer said.","His other big surprises?","\"Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded,\" Mr. Ballmer said, referring to various efforts to fight poverty that he has supported. \"I mean it\u2019s funny, but I didn\u2019t realize all these not-for-profits were in a sense almost like government contractors.\"","Mr. Ballmer said he wanted the project to be completely apolitical. He has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle. But as he speaks, you can tell that some of his findings from the new data \u2014 which rebut his preconceptions \u2014 could change his own politics.","At one point, as he showed me the value of certain tax deductions and blurted out, \"If you look at these tax deductions for employer-provided health or for state and local taxes or mortgage-interest deductions, they\u2019re really subsidies to the affluent, which I guess I hadn\u2019t thought about them.\"","\"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes. That is worth, to a middle-income family, a hundred bucks a year. I was a little surprised by that. You can have your own reaction; I was a little surprised by that.\"","One rule Mr. Ballmer said his team made early on was to use only government data \u2014 no outside providers \u2014 to avoid accusations of bias. But this created its own challenges.","For example, Mr. Ballmer, said: \"You know it\u2019s not legal to know how many firearms that are in this country? The government is not allowed to collect the number.\"","There is data for the number of firearms manufactured, licenses, inspections, \"along with other data, but not a total,\" he said. \"I can\u2019t show it! I\u2019m shocked! But the N.R.A. apparently has lobbied in such a way government can\u2019t report the data.\"","Mr. Ballmer is hoping that the website is just the beginning. He hopes to open it up so that individuals and companies can build on top of it and pull out customized reports.","\"We\u2019re making philanthropic donations elsewhere \u2014 I think of this as another,\" he said, referring to himself and his wife. \"I don\u2019t even deduct this for my taxes. I pay this with after-tax money, no pretax money, because I don\u2019t want anybody being able to think that factors in. But I feel like it\u2019s a civic contribution more than anything else.\""],"targetTitle":"Steve Ballmer Serves Up a Fascinating Data Trove ","targetDescription":"A stealthy pet project by the former Microsoft chief lets you search and learn about how the government spends tax dollars.","targetKeywords":"Ballmer  Steven A,USAFacts,United States Politics and Government,Data-Mining and Database Marketing,Local Government,Politics and Government","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"provenance":{"source":"anonymized","humanSpoiler":null,"spoilerPublisher":null},"spoiler":["People who work in schools, higher ed, public institutions of education \u2014 they are government employees.","Most of the not-for-profits we work with would be 50 to 90 percent government funded","\"Take the mortgage deduction,\" he continued. \"This is to stimulate homeownership amongst people who are already going to own homes.
