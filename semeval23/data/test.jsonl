Photo via Getty","Reports on the income inequality gap and the separate lives of the wealthy and the poor have become depressingly rote. The rich are not like you or me: They can buy their way into exclusive clubs, special social networks, even elitist sex parties. The poorest people in America are now on average not making enough to meet their basic needs\u2014that sounds pretty bad, but can I interest you in a $700 juicer?","In that context, the publication, in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), of a new study that looks at income and life expectancy after age 40 contains no bombshells. The report, covered widely by the New York Times and pretty much every other outlet on Monday, drills down into how income and longevity correlate. The richest 1 percent of men lives, on average, 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women that gap is ten years. But the ability of money and the things it buys\u2014access to better medical care, leisure time, healthier food\u2014to stave off death is well known. The big finding from Stanford economist Raj Chetty and his seven co-authors is not that rich people live longer, it's that the life expectancies of Americans in poverty varies wildly depending on where they live.","Here's how the Times summarizes it: \"The poor in some cities\u2014big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.\u2014live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.\"","For the wealthy, it doesn't matter where they live\u2014they seem to have the access to the same sorts of advantages wherever they go. \"It is as if the top income percentiles belong to one world of elite, wealthy US adults,\" wrote Nobel Prize\u2013winning economist Angus Deaton in an article that accompanied the study in JAMA, \"whereas the bottom income percentiles each belong to separate worlds of poverty, each unhappy and unhealthy in its own way.\"","The obvious question, then, is what makes those individual islands of scarcity more or less healthy than other communities? That's beyond the scope of the paper, but it's clear that the answer isn't simply that some places have fewer or worse doctors. \"The JAMA paper found that several measures of access to medical care had no clear relationship with longevity among the poor,\" noted the Times. \"But there were correlations with smoking, exercise, and obesity.\"","The places where the poor lived the longest include New York and San Francisco\u2014rich cities that can afford to provide a lot of services and have proactive public health departments. San Francisco was a pioneer in smoking bans; New York abolished trans fats. Poor people in and around Birmingham had a surprisingly high life expectancy, but there too there has been an investment in health services, according to the Times, and banned smoking in restaurants and other places in 2012.","Any study like this comes with some caveats. One reason poor people in major metropolises have longer life expectancies could be that they have higher proportions of immigrants, who tend to live longer than native-born Americans. Some people have lower incomes because their poor health damaged their earnings power, not the other way round. And the authors adjusted the statistics for race and ethnicity in order to correct for racial differences in life expectancy (for instance, black people generally live less long than whites), something they've been criticized for. \"Social marginalization is not reducible to single variables,\" wrote Steven Woolf and Jason Purnell in a JAMA editorial. \"Race\/ethnicity is inseparable from the economic consequences and stress associated with segregation, past and present marginalization in the distribution of resources, structural racism, persistent poverty, and violence.\"","But if we accept the broader findings here, there seems to be almost a trickle-down affect when it comes to long life and health. In poverty-pocked areas in the Midwest and the South, poor people die sooner; in other words, in places that lack the services and infrastructure that wealthy big cities usually provide, people are less healthy.","\"Health is about more than healthcare,\" Woolf and Purnell wrote. Good schools, crime-free neighborhoods, childhoods spared the trauma of family dysfunction, and other factors all contribute to whether someone is happy and healthy as an adult, or whether they're trapped in that old cycle of poverty begetting stress begetting illness begetting more poverty.","Seen from this angle, inequality looks like not just a matter of unfair numbers but a public health problem. New York's example suggests at least the bones of a solution: higher taxes to fund a local government that develops policies to discourage people from eating crappy food and smoking. In many ways, this is a punishingly unfair city, but when it comes to having a healthy populace, it seems like other places could benefit from some New York values."],"targetTitle":"The One Strange Trick That Will Help You Live Longer: Have a Bunch of Money","targetDescription":"A new study showed that the wealthy are living longer than the poor\u2014but the size of that life expectancy gap varied wildly depending on where they lived.

Tossing and turning on your bed, just randomly checking the fridge for late night munchies and scrolling through your social media must be your usual post-midnight activities for sure. If you are wondering how to get uninterrupted sleep, then this will help. We have a list of things which people usually do to get a good sleep. Maybe you can try them out too! ","1. Take a long, warm shower with sweet-smelling essential oils. ","Fragrances such as lavender or jasmine will help you relax and calm you down. Add a few drops of your favourite essential oils to your bath water and de-stress after a long day at work. You can set up aromatic candles in your bathroom too. ","2. Create the perfect ambience before you head over to sleep.","Clean your room of the whole day\u2019s mess, dab some perfume and make your bed with some fresh bed sheets and pillow covers. When your surroundings are neat and soothing, you will be able to relax easily and put yourself to sleep sooner. Don\u2019t forget the dim lights! (Fairy lights are always magical.) ","3. Let your bed exclusively be for sleeping.","Keep your bed as the ONLY-FOR-SLEEPING zone! Whether it is working, eating or catching up some shows on your laptop or phone, do it all away from the bed. Condition your mind to think that the bed is meant strictly for sleeping. So, when you actually come and fall flat on it, your brain will know just what to do next. ","4.

The trip was full of surprises: lizards in our suitcase, a couple days on islands with no Wi-Fi (and no English), and days spent doing yoga on the beach to round it all out. But what was perhaps the most baffling part of the whole thing was the one question I was asked again and again from fellow moms: \"Who is watching your kids?\"","If I were a single mother, the question might be valid. But as a married mom whose husband has an equal hand in raising our brood to adulthood, it's quite astonishing to be asked that question again and again. No, I didn't hire a babysitter (at least not for the nights or weekends). No, I didn't leave them with the grandparents. My husband was with them.","Why would anyone find this shocking?","OK, so it's true. The list of daily tasks for the care and upkeep of three children is seemingly endless \u2014 from the moment they leap out of bed between 7 and 7:15 to the moment they hit the pillows around 8 or 8:30. The 2-year-old must be changed, washed, brushed, soothed, fed, held, rocked, amused, and watched multiple times a day. My 9-year-old and 7-year-old have homework to supervise, friend dramas to negotiate, permission slips to sign, and activities to attend. They dress and bathe themselves, but someone must be vigilant at all times to keep them on track.","Most Popular","Truth be told, I work part-time, so the bulk of the child duties does fall to me. But my husband knows the score. He is responsible for preschool drop-off every morning. He picks up from gymnastics every Wednesday, and takes charge of math homework and making sure our son reads for exactly 20 minutes every night. He changes diapers and also has access to the giant family calendar that hangs in our mudroom to track everyone's doctors appointments, playdates, birthday parties, and after-school activities. I might be behind the wheel mostly, but he's always next to me in the front seat reading the map.","So why the question?","Our society is full of all kinds of families, but our leafy suburb just outside of New York City often feels like there is one kind: traditional two-parent homes where one parent (usually the dad) works full-time while the long-suffering mother does everything with her kids. When I went on a business trip for a week two years ago, a friend confided in me: \"My husband wouldn't even be able to pack a lunch if I left.\"","Why are we accepting this as normal?","My husband regularly goes to California for work. Last year, there were long periods where he left every Tuesday and returned on Friday afternoon. Not once, in all those weeks of lonely nights and busy mornings, did anyone ask him who was watching the kids. It's obvious, right? Daddies get to go out in the world. Mommies stay home. Mommy has it all under control. And I do. Mostly. But it's not easy when one spouse travels. A job that really belongs to two people suddenly falls to one. It's a fact my husband understands well.","This is why I needed a vacation. Alone.","\"How long are you gone again?\" he texted me on Wednesday, six days into my 11-day trip.","I had to laugh. But that is all I did. Because I knew that back home, even though he felt like he was drowning, he would doggy paddle his way back to shore somehow. My toddler's cot sheet might not get washed for preschool. And my son might get a B on a spelling test instead of his usual A, because my husband doesn't ride him as hard as I would've if I was home. But my children would be clean, well-fed, and (mostly) smiling when I got back. And they were.","My husband is not a babysitter. He is a parent just like me. Being alone with the kids is a challenge even for the most organized and dedicated among us. But that doesn't make Daddy less capable of it.","Upon my return, a friend said she could \"never do what you did.\" Her husband wouldn't be able to keep it together. Not without massive amounts of help. And that's exactly the reason to go. Kids need to know their daddies can care for them as well. Fathers have an equal part in creating them and should have an equal role in raising them.","So go on. Leave the kids with Daddy. It's good for everyone. And I promise when you do, I will never ask you who is taking care of them.

{"postId":"827761870916423680","postText":["Ottessa Moshfegh's stories of selfish people doing foul things are must-reads"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["The protagonist of \"Malibu,\" the third short story in Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s new collection, spends his time making up job applications so he can continue to receive unemployment benefits and try to coax money out of his aging uncle, who has a colostomy bag and does little but eat fatty meals in front of daytime TV. He\u2019s handsome but pimply and given to throwing up after eating; he daydreams of the beautiful woman he\u2019ll one day fall in love with, but treats the real women he meets like inconveniently sentient Kleenex.","Oh, and then there are his hands. \"As good-looking as I was, I was scared nobody would ever marry me,\" he admits. \"I had small hands. They were like a girl\u2019s hands, but with hair. Nobody marries men with hands like that.\" When he goes to a meet-up he\u2019s planned with a strange woman, he shoves his hand down her throat, enjoying that he can see how his intrusive hand bulges her neck. He recalls taking a prostitute to a motel room: \"I sat down next to her and splayed my hands out on the bed. \u2018What do you think about these?\u2019 I asked. Nobody ever gave me the answer I wanted. Nobody ever said, \u2018Oh, so beautiful!\u2019\"","Moshfegh\u2019s fiction is nothing if not distinctive. As in her debut novel, Eileen, the narrators of the 14 stories in Homesick for Another World are gloomy, narcissistic and self-pitying. Their lives are claustrophobic and squalid. They\u2019re constantly squeezing their acne, having sex with people they despise, eating candy and drinking until they\u2019re sick, developing meth addictions just for kicks, and always feeling slightly superior to their own surroundings despite their listless lives. They crave adoration, but look on anyone who gives it to them with contempt.","In one story, a man obsesses over a woman who works at a video game arcade he frequents. He finally manages to secretly court her via text, but quickly loses his interest in her once she seems attainable: \"He took out his phone and reread all her texts again. \u2018I am very lonely and troubled. Who are you?\u2019 She sounded desperate, he thought. He had made a grievous mistake, he thought.\"","In a story called \"The Beach Boy,\" a man\u2019s wife dies suddenly after their 29th anniversary celebration on a tropical island. Initially devastated and adrift, he then catches sight of an unfamiliar face in the photos he developed from the trip. Though it\u2019s out of focus and context-free, he\u2019s convinced that it was a picture taken by his late wife \u2015 of a male prostitute from the island. Suddenly, he\u2019s revolted by her, the woman he thought was a lady, but who he\u2019s now certain was unfaithful. \"Marcia was gone for good now,\" Moshfegh writes after her ashes were disposed of, \"and he felt like celebrating.\"","The women in Homesick for Another World are equally self-involved and dismissive of their romantic partners. In one story, a woman lives with her boyfriend, who manages a dingy apartment complex while pursuing his dream of acting. She quietly loathes him, the way he clenches his muscles constantly to stay in shape, his devotion to a crystal skull he keeps by his bed, the yellow women\u2019s blazer he bought secondhand and considers the height of manly fashion. He develops a meth addiction. She never really tries to leave. In another story, a high school English teacher spends her summers in a dying small town, subsisting on subs and drugs. She has a brief fling with a local: \"I still remember the humility it took for me to agree to take him home.\" She hires a heavily pregnant young woman to clean her home, then calmly ignores it when her housekeeper begins to hemorrhage on the job.","The unpleasant, even grotesque behaviors of her characters seem amplified thanks to Moshfegh\u2019s cool, matter-of-fact prose. In either first-person or close third-person narration, the blunt, unemotional words with which her characters relate their petty cruelties, addictions, and even bodily functions never ceases to be slightly jarring. In much fiction, writers draw us in by painting the relatable, lovable vulnerabilities within even their most nominally unsympathetic characters, complicating our impulse to divide the world into \"good\" and \"bad.\" Moshfegh\u2019s stories do the reverse, confronting readers with the squicky, selfish, and sociopathic inner selves of even outwardly decent people. ","Reading Homesick for Another World offers a similar experience to watching a dark comedy, like the British sitcom \"Peep Show.\" There\u2019s something refreshing and funny about her unvarnished portrayal of human squalor, but also something unsettling and difficult to swallow. It\u2019s not a book to reassure readers of the essential goodness of the human race; it\u2019s a queasy jolt to our optimistic selves, a reminder of the lowest, most id-driven proclivities of humanity. This may sound unappealing, yet Moshfegh\u2019s talent is a sheer delight \u2015 and the heedless misbehavior of her characters is a reminder, needed now more than ever, that we\u2019re not such an elevated species as we\u2019d like to think, and that following our base impulses can lead us nowhere fast. ","The Bottom Line:","Moshfegh\u2019s stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature, which is easy but self-deluding to ignore.","What other reviewers think:","The New York Times: \"If there\u2019s a thematic thread weaving through this collection, it\u2019s the complicated relationship between entrapment in the physical body \u2014 her characters are often probing, picking and searching with their fingertips, as if seeking beauty and potential grace \u2014 and entrapment in social landscapes.\"","NPR: \"There\u2019s not a story in Homesick for Another World that\u2019s anything less than original and perfectly constructed. Moshfegh\u2019s talent is unique, and her characters \u2014 unfiltered, cold, frequently pathetic \u2014 are all the more memorable for their faults and obliviousness.\"","Who wrote it?","Ottessa Moshfegh has previously published a novel, Eileen, which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was given the Hemingway Foundation\/PEN Award. After her book, a noir novel about a miserable and self-loathing young woman who works in a detention center, was nominated for the Man Booker Prize, she notoriously confessed to The Guardian that she\u2019d written the book as a joke to get attention. She has published her short fiction in The Paris Review and The New Yorker, among other outlets.","Who will read it?","Fans of shocking, provocative fiction starring intensely disagreeable characters \u2015 and readers who don\u2019t mind being grossed out.","Opening lines:","\"My classroom was on the first floor, next to the nuns\u2019 lounge. I used their bathroom to puke in the mornings. One nun always dusted the toilet seat with talcum powder. Another nun plugged the sink and filled it with water. I never understood the nuns. One was old and one was young. The young one talked to me sometimes, asked me what I would do for the long weekend, if I\u2019d see my folks over Christmas, and so forth. The old one looked the other way and twisted her robes in her fists when she saw me coming.\"","Notable passage:","\"Her pretty, gleaming calves appeared between the rungs of the banister as she came down the steps. She\u2019d folded the cuffs of her leggings up above her knees, which were red from kneeling on the floor. When her thighs appeared, I saw a black stain of blood at her crotch. She seemed not to know that she was bleeding. There was no way she could have seen the blood past the mountain of her belly, I suppose. She gripped the bucket with one hand and the railing with the other as she descended the stairs.","\"\u2019Oh, shit,\u2019 she said when she reached the landing. \u2018I forgot the broom.\u2019\"","Homesick for Another World By Ottessa Moshfegh Penguin Press, $26.00 Published January 3, 2017","The Bottom Line is a weekly review combining plot description and analysis with fun tidbits about the book."],"targetTitle":"The Bottom Line: 'Homesick For Another World' By Ottessa Moshfegh","targetDescription":"Ottessa Moshfegh's stories of selfish people doing foul things capture the dark side of human nature.","targetKeywords":"bottom line,Literature, fiction,writing,romance movies,Teen Fashion,Man Booker Prize,Biographies (Books),homesick for another world","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":14}

Together, those countries own about $281 billion in U.S. debt, down from $298.4 billion in January.","A Freedom of Information Act request filed by A Freedom of Information Act request filed by Bloomberg News led to the Treasury Department breaking down the assets by country. The U.S. started releasing data on foreign ownership of Treasuries in 1974, but had never specified how much Saudi Arabia holds.","The $116.8 billion Saudi Arabia owns puts it in the top 12 foreign nations with holdings of U.S. debt, falling between India and Singapore. Its total pales in comparison to China\u2019s whopping $1.3 trillion and Japan\u2019s $1.1 trillion.","Saudi holdings of Treasuries peaked at $123.6 billion in January, the data released Monday show. The numbers were made public as part of the Treasury\u2019s regular monthly reports.","The disclosure comes during an unusually tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations. Last month Saudi officials warned the country would sell off $750 billion worth of Treasuries and other assets in the states if Congress approved a bill that would allow the monarchy to be sued in American courts for any role in the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.","Officials in Washington and Riyadh were already on edge because President Obama is said to be seriously considering declassifying 28 pages of a congressional report into the 2001 attacks that some say indicate the hijackers, 15 of whom were Saudi Arabian, received support, explicit or otherwise, from the country\u2019s vast royal family.","Intelligence officials have been reviewing whether to make the pages public since 2014 and are due to deliver a recommendation to the president. Whatever the recommendation, the White House has said Obama could ultimately use his executive authority to make the pages public.","The Treasury Department\u2019s disclosure answers one of the questions surrounding the relationship between the two countries and shows that the monarchy, while an important player in the U.S. financial system, doesn\u2019t have as much leverage as many likely believed."],"targetTitle":"Just how much US debt does Saudi Arabia own?","targetDescription":"Saudi Arabia holds roughly $117 billion of the U.S. government\u2019s debt, according to Treasury Department data that disclosed the country\u2019s holdings for the first time in over 40 years.

I will forever live in the fear of finding out my parents have turned into pigs, perhaps somewhat irrationally, mostly because that detail was never clear to me after watching the movie fifteen years ago.","But today, unsettled viewers might be able to find some peace. Spirited Away fans have long speculated over the deeper meaning of fantastical moments in the film , and now we're finally getting some answers.","Twitter user @0910noncha sent some questions about the film to Studio Ghibli earlier this year, and to her delight, she got a thoughtful reply from a Ghibli employee, which she posted to her Twitter account on July 9.","She wanted to know why the Chihiro's parents turned into pigs, what was in their food, and how she managed to pass her final exam. In the letter Studio Ghibli explained that the swine transformation represented the greed that took place during Japan's bubble economy of the 80s.","The letter explained that once someone transforms into a pig, it's irreversible, and Miyazaki used the metaphor to describe the real world and how greed changes people. \"This doesn\u2019t just apply to the fantasy world,\" it read.","The letter went on to say that none of the pigs in the pen were Chihiro's parents, which she knew because \"as a 10-year-old girl, could understand the difference because she had overcome difficulties and had managed to acquire the 'energy to live' \u2014 which is something everyone can do naturally,\" the letter stated according to a translation by RocketNews24.","Albeit being a bit vague, the meaning behind Chihiro's parents transformation deepens the theme on greed and sheds light on a part of Japanese history that most Spirited Away fans don't know much about. Japan's market crash of 1991 threw the country into a financial crisis so severe it's remembered today as the \"lost decades\" and Miyazaki used Chihiro's parents as a reminder that greed leads to devastating consequences. The metaphor also serves as a reminder of the richness behind Ghibli films."],"targetTitle":"Studio Ghibli solves one of Spirited Away's biggest mysteries","targetDescription":"15 years later we finally have some answers","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/logo_konbini.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/picto_snapchat.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/snapchat_konbini.png","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/icon_snapchat.png","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/konbini-instagram.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/logo_reddit.png","http:\/\/static.boredpanda.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/spirited-away-chihiro-parents-become-pigs-meaning-studio-ghibli-hayao-miyazaki-6.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/logo_konbini_footer.png","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/loader.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/blogs.dir\/9\/files\/2016\/07\/85118acb2a200d2c45a0ce0a78f22433-480x279.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/snapchat_konbini_gplay.png","http:\/\/www.konbini.com\/en\/files\/2016\/07\/85118acb2a200d2c45a0ce0a78f22433.jpg","http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/96484b34f86b2d82b2c3324a7c32c022?s=100&d=mm&r=g","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/picto_fb.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/picto_twitter.gif","http:\/\/cdn.konbini.com\/wp-content\/themes\/konbini\/images\/snapchat_konbini_app_store.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.konbini.com\/us\/entertainment\/studio-ghibli-finally-explains-chihiros-parents-become-pigs-spirited-away\/","id":16}
{"postId":"749975814461124609","postText":["In the Digital Age, is shopping America's new religion?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["This month, Art Basel Global Director Marc Spiegler joins CNN Style as guest editor . He's commissioning a series of features on the topic of art and technology.","(CNN) American-Qatari artist Sophia Al-Maria is preparing for the biggest exhibition of her career.","Her solo show \" Black Friday ,\" which opens at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art on July 26, will comprise over 100 new videos, screened on a series of broken or rejected consumer electronics.","The title, Al-Maria says, is in part a reference to the American \"national holiday of shopping,\" but also a nod to the holy nature of Fridays in Islam.","The exhibition \"posits the thought that shopping malls have become a kind of replacement for religious structures in our contemporary consumer society,\" she says.","Gulf Futurism","\"Black Friday\" sits comfortably in Al-Maria's roster of projects. Exemplifying of a new generation of creative polymaths, the writer-filmmaker-artist has produced photos, directed films, written articles and screenplays, and published a critically acclaimed memoir, \"The Girl Who Fell to Earth.\"","In her memoir Al-Maria talks about being brought up between two vastly different cultures. Born to an American mother and a Qatari Bedouin father, she spent her childhood in the US before moving to Qatar. There, she experienced the intense and rapid technological and cultural development of the Gulf.","Still from \"The Future was Desert Part II\" (2016) by Sophia Al-Maria","Witnessing this evolution inspired her to coin the term \"Gulf Futurism,\" inspired by \"the idea that time travel had literally occurred in one generation [in Qatar], from a sort of pre-agrarian society -- at least in terms of Bedouin culture -- deep into hyper capitalism and consumerism,\" as Al-Maria describes it.","Techno-pessimism","More than anything, Gulf Futurism is perhaps an investigation into some of the more negative aspects of a hyper-connected digital society that can sometimes be a lonely place -- a perspective Al-Maria describes as \"techno-pessimistic.\"","Born in 1983, she describes herself as an early digital native, part of the first crop of millennials. While the rise of the Internet was a key aspect of her formative years, her work often deals with the isolating nature of the digital space.","Still from \"Between Distant Bodies\" (2013) by Sophia Al-Maria","\"A few years ago I had a real feeling of heaviness through things like Facebook, like I was dragging the ghost of every person I had ever met.

{"postId":"835298520513069057","postText":["5 essential investing moves for millennials"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["If you believe recent reports from the web, you probably think Millennials are financial floozies, trading their retirement money for Venti lattes.","The reality is probably not that bad, but also not as click-worthy: Research from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies indicates that nearly three-quarters of Millennials are saving for retirement and that we started doing so at an earlier age than previous generations. Wells Fargo data show that of those who are saving, half are putting away 6% of their income or more.","What we're not so hot at, according to many of these same surveys, is investing. Many of us are frightened or confused by the topic and even inclined to put our money in a sock and call it a day. That's a problem, because investing the money you save is nearly as important as saving it in the first place.","Here are five crucial moves Millennials can make to overcome their investing anxieties.","1. Get an education","At least this one will be free. Investing is understandably scary. Until you learn what you're doing, it feels an awful lot like gambling in Vegas without the free drinks.","There are plenty of resources to guide you through the basics; you just have to put in the time. Khan Academy is a good place to start, as is NerdWallet's guide on how to invest in stocks. Morningstar has a good, if slightly dated, investing classroom, and online brokers often have a ton of beginner-focused educational materials on their websites.","2. Say hello to risk","Risk is kind of like that friend who regularly cancels plans but always comes through in a pinch. There might be heartache in the day-to-day, but in the long run, you'll be glad you stuck it out.","In investing, more risk means the potential for more reward. Investments that require you to take on risk, like stocks, have to offer you a premium for doing so. Could you lose money and never collect that premium? Sure, but that's unlikely when you're in it for the long-term. ","History illustrates this: A portfolio of 100% stocks had an average annual return of 10.1% between 1926 and 2015, according to a study by Vanguard. A portfolio of 100% bonds returned roughly half that, averaging 5.4%. To put that into real-money terms, if you invested $5,000 for 50 years at a 10.1% return, you'd have $614,000. At a 5.4% return, you'd have just $69,000.","But a 2015 study from BlackRock found that Millennials might have as much as 70% of their money in cash, meaning a savings account, a pillowcase, old sneakers. At today's historically low interest rates, it's all roughly the same. That $5,000 becomes just $8,000 at a 1% return; in your shoe, it stays $5,000. Factor in inflation   a force that Millennials may soon notice for the first time in their adult lives   and you're actually losing money.","3. Take that risk through index funds","About 70% would be a reasonable stock allocation for your retirement portfolio   and even that might be on the low side. At this age, you should have most of your long-term savings invested in stocks. The best way to do that is not by dumping your money into Apple stock, but with low-cost index and exchange-traded funds.","Those funds pool investor money to buy many different investments in one swoop. You can buy a couple of funds that hold the stock of U.S. companies, one that holds international companies and one that holds emerging-markets companies and you'll be reasonably diversified.","You can learn more about building a diversified portfolio in NerdWallet's piece on investing in your 20s.","4. Put a lid on fees","You can't control the ups and downs of the stock market. What you can mostly control are investing costs   fees charged by your index funds (called expense ratios), administrative fees in your 401(k) and transaction fees incurred when you buy and sell investments.","Every dollar that goes to these costs is a dollar that reduces your returns. Keep transaction costs down by limiting unnecessary trading and using commission-free and no-transaction-fee funds. Most brokers will have a list of both types of funds. If an index fund's expense ratio is more than 0.25%, you can likely do better with another.","5. Use a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k)","Contributions to a traditional 401(k) or IRA are made with pre-tax dollars; you pay taxes when you take distributions in retirement. But you can also pay taxes now and spare your future self the burden by choosing a Roth IRA (check Roth contribution limits to gauge your eligibility) or the Roth version of your 401(k), if your employer offers that option.","Why choose a Roth? If your income is lower now than it will be later   a likely scenario for many young professionals   you're locking in at lower tax rate. And because you're not getting a tax benefit now, you get to pull out the money   both your contributions and investment growth   tax free in retirement. To see how valuable that is, use a Roth IRA calculator."],"targetTitle":"5 Essential Investing Moves For Millennials","targetDescription":"Research shows millennials are strong savers, but hesitant to invest.

The veterinary procedure has been offered for many years, but that could cease to be the case, at least in New York, if legislation to ban the practice goes though.","For those who don't own cats, declawing may sound like simple nail clipping, but it's a very serious medical operation. Medically referred to as an onychectomy, declawing a cat is essentially amputation. Feline nails, unlike ours, are attached to their bones. To remove them, vets have to cut through tendon and nerves in order to fully remove the nail and bone. The human equivalent, as the Human Society of the United States describes it, is \"cutting off each finger at the last knuckle.\"","The gravity of the procedure is why lobbyists are hoping to make it illegal in New York. \"It's the equivalent of taking a cigar cutter and cutting the end joint off,\" veterinarian Jennifer Conrad, who helped lobby for the cause, told a Daily Freeman reporter. Kristine Brabson, site director of GoodHousekeeping.com and devout cat lover (she has six of them), strongly opposes declawing. \"It's torture to cats. Why would Mother Nature give your cat claws, for you just to pay to rip them out?\"","Most Popular","Many cat owners opt for the procedure to avoid a cat's destructive behavior, particularly against their furniture. To that, assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, who is sponsoring the bill, says:","\"I've heard so many times: 'I have expensive furniture! I have nice drapes!\u200b If your standard is, 'I need pristine furniture,' don't get a cat.\"","The controversial practice is already banned in Los Angeles, Australia, Britain and many countries in Europe. This ban marks the first time the issue has reached statewide level in the U.S, the Associated Press reports.","Meanwhile, many veterinarians understand the concern regarding the procedure, but disagree with a ban. \"None of us love the procedure. But when the alternative is condemning the cat to a shelter or to death? That's why we do it,\" says veterinarian New York City Richard Goldstein. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports the procedure, but \"only after attempts have been made to prevent the cat from using its claws destructively or when its clawing presents an above normal health risk for its owner(s).\" Still, 130 New York vets are completely supportive of the ban.","The bill is currently with the Senate and Assembly, but no voting date has been determined, reports the Huffington Post.","(h\/t Daily Freeman)"],"targetTitle":"Cat Claw Removal","targetDescription":"New York is looking to ban cat declawing.

The college football standout is eligible for the 2014 NFL Draft and is poised to become the first active openly gay player in the league's history. He spoke publicly about his sexuality for the first time to The New York Times and ESPN on Sunday.","\"I am an openly, proud gay man,\" Sam told ESPN.","The 24-year-old from Hitchcock, Texas revealed to both outlets that he had come out to his teammates during a preseason football practice before the Tigers' 2013 campaign.","\"I understand how big this is,\" Sam told ESPN. \"It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL.\"","A 6-foot-2, 255-pound senior who was voted co-defensive player of the year in the vaunted Southeastern Conference for the 2013 season, Sam made his announcement just two weeks before the NFL Scouting Combine begins on Feb. 22 in Indianapolis.","\"We admire Michael Sam\u2019s honesty & courage,\" the NFL said in a statement released on Sunday, via Ian Rapoport of NFL.com. \"Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in NFL.\"","Sam recounted for The New York Times the moment when he came out to his teammates during a team-building exercise at preseason practice last year.","\"I looked in their eyes, and they just started shaking their heads -- like, finally, he came out,\" Sam said.","After coming out to his teammates and coaches during the preseason, Sam starred on the field as the Missouri rolled to a 12-2 record and a 41-31 win in the Cotton Bowl. Given the type of year that Sam had, he was rated as the 12th-best outside pass rusher available in the upcoming NFL draft by ESPN Scouts Inc. and projected to be a mid-round selection. With the NFL's readiness for its first active openly gay player an open question, Sam's draft position will be watched closely in May. Several unnamed NFL personnel members interviewed by Sports Illustrated after Sam's announcement believed that coming out would adversely affect his draft stock.","\"I don't think football is ready for [an openly gay player] just yet,\" an anonymous NFL player personnel assistant said, reported Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated. \"In the coming decade or two, it's going to be acceptable, but at this point in time it's still a man's-man game. To call somebody a [gay slur] is still so commonplace. It'd chemically imbalance an NFL locker room and meeting room.\"","The general manager of one NFL team told Peter King of Sports Illustrated that he believed Sam would not even be drafted after coming out. Meanwhile, GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis contended that the leadership displayed by Sam should make teams eager to have him on the roster.","\"By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL,\" Ellis said in a statement. \"With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.\"","Should any NFL executives or coaches with questions turn to Missouri head football coach Gary Pinkel for answers then they will likely hear about Sam's desire to keep the focus on football and the example he set for this teammates.","\"We\u2019re really happy for Michael that he\u2019s made the decision to announce this, and we\u2019re proud of him and how he represents Mizzou,\" Pinkel said in a statement. \"Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he\u2019s taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn\u2019t matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we\u2019re all on the same team and we all support each other. If Michael doesn\u2019t have the support of his teammates like he did this past year, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way he has the type of season he put together.\"","One of Sam's former teammates at Missouri, Trey Hobson, was also among those expressing support for him on Twitter.","Shout out to my former Teammate Michael Sam. Though its old news to us its a Great move by a great guy. Wish u much success in the future! \u2014 Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014","Never cared if Michael was gay... As long as he put that pass rush on the QB and made my job easier i didnt give a damn... \u2014 Trey HobsonTM (@TreyHob21) February 10, 2014","Sam had been planning on coming out publicly before the NFL Draft but he had initially intended for the news to break after the NFL Combine, according to Outsports' behind-the-scenes look at the announcement. His plans were accelerated after unnamed scouts at the Senior Bowl in January were asking about his sexuality.","\"At the Senior Bowl, it was the first question I got from the scouts almost every time,\" one of Sam's agents, Joe Barkett, told Outsports. \"He didn't feel there was an agenda behind the question other than trying to determine if the word on the Internet was true. \"They would ask about spending time with him, were there girls around? Who is his girlfriend? They didn't ask that about another client, Tom Hornsey. They only asked it about Michael.\"","Wanting to come out on his own terms, Sam altered his initial timetable, eventually speaking with ESPN and The New York Times on Sunday. After the news broke, Sam took to Twitter to thanks those who helped him in coming out.","I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement,especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world! \u2014 Michael Sam (@MikeSamFootball) February 10, 2014","While Sam was thankful for the support he received, Athlete Ally Youth Programs Director Akil Patterson was among those noting the impact that this pioneering decision could have on others.","\"Having played Division I football as a closeted gay man, I recognize the game-changing potential here for athletes everywhere, \" Patterson, a former standout offensive lineman at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. \"If Michael Sam can navigate this transition into the NFL as an out man of color, it will open doors for young people everywhere, particularly in football. More athletes will feel comfortable being true to themselves at a younger age and that will translate into better performance on the field and in the classroom. I think we have the capacity to go from one trailblazer to a large community of players within a surprisingly short period of time.\"","Although several former NFL players have come out after retiring and it was widely presumed that there are currently gay players in the league, there has never been an openly gay player. In April 2013, veteran NBA center Jason Collins came out with a first-person piece in Sports Illustrated. The 35-year-old was entering free agency and did not find a new team for the 2013-2014 season. A month later, former U.S. national soccer team player Robbie Rogers became the first active openly gay player in a major professional North American team sport when he stepped onto the field for the L.A.

I was intimidated by the huge choice and the fast pace at which users were bidding, but after reading the help section of the site and a few minutes of observation, it all became clear.","So I joined an auction for the iPad Pro I wanted so much, and I was pleasantly surprised, after less than an hour, to win it for only \u00a357.76!","A brand new, still under warranty Apple iPad Pro, worth more than \u00a3400 in retail, for less than \u00a360!","I still had trouble believing it, so I decided to wait for the actual delivery of my iPad Pro. A few days later, it arrived directly to my home!","But I could have been lucky, and only one victory hardly is a valid test. I then returned to Swoggi to try to win something else, with my remaining credits. And this time, I went directly to the big prize: an iMac 21.5 inches, worth \u00a31150. The competition with other members of the site was tougher than for the iPad Pro, but I still managed to get it, achieving an even better discount: the iPad Pro at only \u00a391.04! This site is truly one of a kind!","Once again, the delivery was quick and the customer service really helpful! I can say I am definitely convinced by Swoggi!","How to use Swoggi?","If you want to enjoy the same crazy discounts, you will need only a few instructions to get started. The workings of this new type of shopping can be intimidating at first, so I will try to explain in a few steps how you can get the same savings achieved. Despite what you could think when looking at it for the first time, it is actually extremely simple:","Step 1: Create an account on Swoggi and get your free credits. Use the following voucher code to get 50 free credits!","Code: MAY50. Offer will expire soon, hurry up! CLICK HERE","Step 2: Browse the Live Auctions to find a product you would like to win, click on the auction and start bidding!","Step 3: When you win an auction, you will be automatically redirected to the payment page where you will need to pay the closing price and confirm you delivery address.","Conclusion","I started out this test as a sceptic, but after winning two apple products for less than 20% of their value, I can say without any doubt that this new form of online shopping is a GREAT way to save money on high tech, expensive products!"],"targetTitle":"Money Expert","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/1be9985d41ebe30f4fa19f44077c648115e5d1de.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/a744c97c0629576a48a5d7fe2234d34eed5b9c29.gif","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/8cb9dff262e55c8f00020b06ad9c9d2aacc5f793.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/e444d54a1dceda9b87a0da0376be0580c29a5373.gif","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/e7625f6c67261dfa234dd634fb90088774932dad.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/ac007ca64e3a61e1ea5c19b5ce5ba720e166dc6b.gif","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/b6180353fcbb0dd8fc08e7f026fc9bd221513596.gif","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAABU1BMVEUAAAABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCwsfHx8dHR0ICAgCAgIVFRUSEhISEhIODg5TU1MFBQUCAgIDAwNJSUkTExMEBAQHBwcICAgEBAQMDAwCAgJZWVk5OTkKCgoUFBQhISEODg4KCgoAAAANDQ0MDAwCAgIBAQEjIyMCAgIvLy8AAAAVFRUPDw8ODg4QEBAAAAAKCgovLy8qKioKCgoTExMAAAASEhIODg4EBAQAAAAFBQUKCgoKCgoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcXFwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEBAAAAAeHh4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgIoKCgkJCQNDQ12dnYSEhIdHR0lJSUmJiYwMDAUFBQZGRkKCgpiYmKCFFTcAAAAYnRSTlMAAAQCB+9A\/gFZYMtZCwADOK7fSgEA9k8APVM3pCfZpCenzKzqGgAAABHgJpHABxMZeE4k4epZw4I8eK5zAF1oSfMhmf7HKzGF1tO0RzIxna+4zTUDJecM4KyL0GEQw2Xe1BogW7kAAAC\/SURBVHheNY1Tg8RAEAY7yWZt2zbOtm2jszji\/3OnZy710l\/VSwOjGQbCYrPTkSRrMuWQ2Mp85ig4Xd7Rn3uRLZ+nRiHgr28EQ3IkGosnQGA+Sp9kB+\/f+YLwYqlcqfZ\/fjVsGHhotaHz8aYho0vem5icmh4iZ4bC7Fd\/bh4FCxSUpWVYEb66BvqfdXLT5ta2rKed3b39g0PVdKxwNZ6enV8AXCJe8c\/XN4i37Mp39w9APKqIT3wpIHh+eTXCP2MHbSZMouN0pwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/de82b8ac20b8cb32aa1248e8c0518914aebaa11c.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/f11015fc9f5390cbe1b6a7f893dc9bf215f1de1e.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/7cb08dac51a638de6c8ecf9015ced8d29c82b825.gif","data:image\/jpeg;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/7e8ab77c421e81108f153c9e16eb29de94a6b100.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/8af006402497bc9d0bfb03097e26e2b242aa604e\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/tw0Dp\/1714cc27ec1315c88cdb61bc8ba19b130904422f.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","data:image\/jpeg;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAA4AAAANCAAAAAC8twCjAAAAmUlEQVR42k3HsQ7BUBSA4b+3p4SBQGBjFUk7exDPapWwCZZOBkZDoUkjkd6eY2DwbZ\/Yy11sWhKdg4k2hVU78Zsro9jW+VLwxY1CLM+q+xuhrikWqT+oCkLYmWEYZrsbQtjo89UAwRn5PkmLcWwBghqVjxbHAYCgSremr2fyKzBvETtCEHhsXXTCpVUWIPSyzAFaeh0iLPjzAf6cQrE1ApjEAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"],"targetUrl":"Can you really save up to 90% on brand new iPhone 6s, iPad Pro and Macbooks?","id":22}

It was started by Elliot Costello, and it involves men painting one of their fingernails. Curious as to why? Read on...","When Costello ventured to Cambodia, he met a young girl named Thea who lived in an underprivileged location. The two spent plenty of time together, bonding over games and painting each others\u2019 nails. Eventually, Thea felt comfortable enough to disclose to Elliot that she was enduring constant sexual abuse","Shocked, sickened, and likely a bit heartbroken, Elliot promised the young girl that he would keep one of his nails painted in remembrance of her and her struggle. In addition, he would do whatever he could to raise awareness about her \u2013 and many other children\u2019s \u2013 plight.","Inspired, Elliot founded The Polished Man Project which aims to raise awareness about the number of children who face sexual abuse around the world.","Why this activism is powerful:","behind the painted fingernail, and be referred to learn more about the project by visiting The Polish Man Project\u2019s At first glance, one painted fingernail on a guy might be determined to be \u2018weird\u2019. But upon further inspection, one could learn about the reason of the painted fingernail, and be referred to learn more about the project by visiting The Polish Man Project\u2019s webpage","On the website, people can donate to sexual abuse trauma and recovery prevention. For this reason, The Polished Man Project is very worthy of attention and admiration.","Already, the project has taken off in Australia, parts of Europe, and the United States. It has inspired countless men to raise awareness about sexual abuse against children, and has compelled some to \u2018be the change\u2019 by donating to recovery programs","Remember, 1 in 5 children are \u2013 or have been \u2013 victims of sexual abuse.

{"postId":"796215710095646720","postText":["NEW: How Trump won Florida"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["With more than 95 percent of precincts reporting, Donald Trump carried a 140,000 vote lead in Florida. | Getty How Trump won Florida Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide.","Donald Trump\u2019s stunning win in Florida was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide on Tuesday: Despite losing big to Hillary Clinton in diverse, urban areas of south Florida, Trump dominated in every other corner of the state and outperformed past Republican candidates with older, white and blue collar voters.","With nearly all precincts reporting,Trump carried a nearly insurmountable 134,000 vote lead \u2013 1.4 percentage points -- leaving Democrats crushed and Trump\u2019s team elated with a win that, at one point, they felt wouldn\u2019t come.","Story Continued Below","\"I am so proud of this team! MAGA!,\" Susie Wiles, Trump\u2019s Florida campaign manager, said in a text message using the acronym for his \"Make America Great Again\" slogan. Her tone was a 180-degree turn from early in the evening when she called the day \"tense and nerve wracking.\"","Despite Hillary Clinton\u2019s large margins in Miami-Dade County and Broward County, Trump ran up the score elsewhere in the state -- from the Deep South Panhandle to the interior of Florida to peninsula\u2019s southwest, a bastion of working-class whites and retirees from the Midwest who pushed him over the top. Trump ran up huge margins with white Florida voters -- who comprise 64 percent of the state\u2019s voting rolls -- and have always been the most reliable voters in terms of turnout. Latino turnout in Miami-Dade and Orange County was just not enough for Clinton.","The ups and downs of the campaign had gnawed at Wiles for weeks when she took over following a campaign shake-up that left her in charge of winning must-win Florida without much of a budget to advertise or turn out Republican voters who tend to disproportionately cast absentee ballots by mail.","In early October, as Hurricane Matthew left part of the state damaged, Wiles realized the campaign had mistakenly not run an absentee ballot program at all. She sounded the alarm and Trump made sure the money was reprogrammed.","Two weeks ago during a meeting at Trump\u2019s golf club in Doral, sources said, Wiles successfully made the case to Trump to spend more on mail, advertising and paid callers to reach out to more Republican absentee ballot voters. Wiles, who managed Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s first campaign, in 2010, would neither confirm nor deny the accounts.","The spending was noteworthy because Trump, notoriously tight-fisted with campaign money, believed that campaigns dropped too much money on TV and get-out-the-vote \"ground game\" efforts. Instead, Trump had his outsized personality, his knowledge of Florida \u2013 his second home where he owns the Palm Beach Mar-a-Lago estate \u2013 and his plane that could carry him to any spot on a moment\u2019s notice in Florida, where thousands of supporters materialized for his rallies seemingly spontaneously.","But even with all of the new Trump spending, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign began to surge. Black and Hispanic voters cast record numbers of absentee ballots and flocked to the early voting polls.","By Tuesday morning, Democrats felt confident they could ride out the wave of what they knew would be a surge of Republican voters who tend to vote in greater force on Election Day.","About 1 p.m., one source with Clinton\u2019s campaign said, the Democrats were worried. Republicans were crushing the vote in the Panhandle, Southwest Florida and smaller conservative-leaning counties.","\"By 5 p.m., our voters showed again,\" the source, not authorized to speak by the campaign, said. \"We felt pretty good.\"","The size of the vote was historic in populous Democratic strongholds like Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties.","But turnout was even higher in Republican areas. By the end of the night, Trump\u2019s lead was so big that, even if turnout in Florida was modeled at 80 percent \u2013 far higher than recent elections \u2013 Clinton would still not win if she beat Trump by double digits.","Clinton\u2019s campaign was almost reduced to a regional effort confined to the southeastern peninsula. She won a stunning 571,000 more votes than Trump in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale media market, one of ten in the state, according to state elections data posted after midnight. She won three lesser markets: West Palm (a 44,000-vote lead); Gainesville (10,000 more votes) and Tallahassee (11,000 more votes).","Trump blew away records in the Tampa Bay media market, the western edge of the vaunted I-4 corridor that helps swing elections. In the counties composing the market, Trump rolled up a 193,000 vote lead over Clinton. In the Jacksonville market in the northeast, he pulled in 165,000 more votes. He held vote leads of 144,000 in Naples-Fort Myers market, 126,000 in the Pensacola market, 83,000 in the Panama City market and 58,000 in the Orlando market, which anchors the eastern end of the I-4 corridor.","One of Trump\u2019s pollsters, Tony Fabrizio, said the results showed that Clinton exceeded President Obama\u2019s margins in the Florida markets he won in 2012. But Obama only carried Florida by less than a point.","\"The difference here is that Trump did far better than Mitt Romney did in almost every county on Election Day,\" Fabrizio said.","Trump began Election Day down by at least 57,000 votes to Clinton, according to results posted on the Florida Division of Elections website just after the last Florida polls closed at 7 p.m. Central Time. But after that, as Election Day votes poured in, Trump began building a margin that stretched to more than 100,000 by 8:30 p.m.","By 9:10 p.m., Trump\u2019s margin started to peak at just under 150,000 votes over Clinton. It started to trend down. But not fast enough for the liking of Democrats, who just two hours before were musing about how Trump had lost Florida and therefore the White House.","\"So goes Florida, so goes the country,\" said Florida\u2019s senior senator, Bill Nelson. \"Look at the Hispanics turning out. Often the Hispanics are registered no party affiliation, but the young Hispanics, they\u2019ll be voting for Hillary.\"","Nelson and other Democrats also expected Clinton to pad her margin with African-American support.","But while Clinton rolled up votes with non-white voters, white voters appeared to heavily trend toward Trump. And whites are still a majority of Florida\u2019s voter rolls, 64 percent by registration. And they vote in even greater numbers. Their outsized support counteracted the votes of Hispanics and blacks \u2013 16 percent and 13 percent of the voter rolls, respectively.","Trump\u2019s strong showing calls into question those who believed his inflammatory comments about immigration reform would ultimately cost him Florida. Trump\u2019s positions put him at loggerheads with the Spanish-language powerhouse network, Univision, which has studios in the same city as his Doral golf club.","\"My theory is that no one can make it to the WH without the Latino vote. It seems @realDonaldTrump has a different theory. See you Nov 8th,\" Univision pundit Jorge Ramos wrote June 3 on Twitter, repeating his oft-held maxim \u2013 proven wrong in this instance by Trump \u2013 about the power of the Hispanic vote.","Florida is also a retiree mecca, with one of the oldest populations in the country. And poll after poll showed that the older the voter, the more they liked Trump.","Most major surveys also showed Trump losing the state \u2013 including exit polls on Election Day.","\"This was a data defying feat that captured a populist fervor we just couldn\u2019t measure,\" said one Republican pollster who was surprised by Trump\u2019s numbers. \"The Trump campaign kept talking about the missing white voter. Well, they showed up on Election Day.\"","In myriad ways, Trump succeeded despite the conventional wisdom.","Trump\u2019s campaign initially didn\u2019t run a robust absentee-ballot program to get voters to fill out and mail back their votes. He delayed advertising on television \u2013 a must for any other statewide candidate. And he refused at times to soften his tone on immigration.","\"Trump didn\u2019t run a robust program in South Florida targeting the Hispanic community. You could make an argument that his past statements [about immigration and illegal immigrants] made it impossible,\" said Curt Anderson, top adviser to Gov. Scott, the chair of the pro-Trump super PAC. \"But when Gov. Scott won, he did so because he really reached out. If Trump had, we wouldn\u2019t be talking right now. He would have Florida in the bag. Maybe he\u2019ll win because of what\u2019s in the countryside, so to speak, or the Panhandle. But this is really doing it the hard way.\"","The Florida meltdown is a familiar story for Democrats still scarred by Al Gore\u2019s 2000 loss to George W. Bush in a razor close race. Though Obama won the state twice, both times were by narrow margins built on the strength of his appeal to minority voters in the state.","But the vaunted Obama machine in Florida was no machine without Obama on the ticket. Now Democrats face a bleak prospect of the coming midterm elections, when liberal-leaning voters tend to stay away from the polls while Republicans keep voting. Sen. Nelson\u2019s team fears a showdown with Scott, who has won twice based on the strength of white voters and an outsider message.","Clinton allies expressed increasing optimism about their chances in the state heading into Election Day, energized by early vote results that showed Hispanic turnout exploding. Exit polls reinforced that optimism, showing Clinton with a narrow lead and demographic trends pointing her way.","Trump\u2019s strength was no surprise to Republican Party of Florida Chairman Blaise Ingoglia, who earlier in the day said Republicans had more energized voters who couldn\u2019t wait until Election Day to cast ballots.","\"We had the advantage in high-propensity voters and they didn\u2019t,\" Ingoglia said. \"But ultimately, this is a message to the establishment. It\u2019s an anti-establishment year.\""],"targetTitle":"How Trump won Florida","targetDescription":"Trump's Florida win was a microcosm of what unfolded nationwide.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/static2.politico.com\/dims4\/default\/343483b\/2147483647\/resize\/1160x%3E\/quality\/90\/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc2%2F56%2F34510eb845e1a9a61cde5be4c131%2F11-donald-trump-8-gty-1160.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","http:\/\/static.politico.com\/c2\/56\/34510eb845e1a9a61cde5be4c131\/11-donald-trump-8-gty-1160.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.politico.com\/story\/2016\/11\/florida-results-not-in-2016-231004","id":28}

While it\u2019s far from mainstream acceptance, UBI is viewed by some as a means to provide workers with economic stability as an increasing amount of the world\u2019s labor is automated.","\"I think we are moving towards a world with less job security,\" says Matthew Krisiloff, who is managing Y Combinator\u2019s UBI study. \"There\u2019s political consensus around it, and there\u2019s relative simplicity in the sense that it\u2019s just direct cash and you can spend it however you want.\"","Here\u2019s what you should know about UBI:","What is Universal Basic Income?","In its most pure form, a government would send all citizens a certain annual income to everyone, regardless of their salary, age or employment status, typically in installments throughout the year.","In reality, it gets a little more complicated. Sending money to every single citizen is expensive, so most UBI proposals involve some limits on who is eligible for the money \u2014 minors and the already-wealthy, for instance, might get smaller checks. Limits aside, the general point remains the same: (Almost) everyone gets a check from the government to spend without restrictions.","Why is it popular?","The basic concept has intellectual roots dating back to at least the 18th century . Some on the political left have supported UBI a tool to redistribute wealth to the poor and provide a means to improve people\u2019s quality of life, while some on the right have seen it as a way to make the existing welfare state more efficient while promoting individual choice and reducing \"welfare traps.\"","Despite sporadic support on both sides of the aisle, UBI has historically remained on the policy fringes. Many worry that a basic income could reduce the incentive to work, slowing the economy. Another concern is whether providing a basic income is the best way to spend public funds that could be specifically targeted to certain groups in need, the model most welfare programs currently follow.","However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent However, a confluence of factors have started to push basic income into the mainstream. Rising inequality and persistently slow economic growth have spawned concerns about the ability for working people to get ahead without increased assistance, for instance. Meanwhile, advances in automation and artificial intelligence have raised the prospect of a future with significantly fewer jobs for human workers. A recent Oxford University study found that as many as 47% percent of jobs are at risk of being computerized (although another study found that number may be as low as 9%).","Is anyone getting paid yet?","No nation has implemented a universal basic income, but the idea has gained traction in a few countries. Sweden recently voted down an initiative that would have implemented a relatively generous basic income for adults on top of the country\u2019s existing social services, Britain\u2019s labor party is considering advocating for a basic income, Finland may implement a version of UBI next year, and a city in the Netherlands is also pursuing a basic income experiment .","Y Combinator\u2019s Krisiloff says the newfound discussion of a basic income represents a fresh attitude towards government welfare programs. \"I think part of the reason it\u2019s back in vogue is because people are more accepting of unconditional programs,\" he says. \"People are starting to think there are more cost effective, less paternalistic, hands-on ways to help.\""],"targetTitle":"Why this tech company is

In fact, there are 22 countries where women have far more parity with their male counterparts than women do in the U.S.","The Global Gender Gap Report ranks 136 countries (which collectively contain over 93 percent of the world's population) based on 14 indicators used to measure the size of a nation's gender gap in four key areas:","1. Economic participation and opportunity, which includes female labor force participation, wage equality and the percentage of women in high-ranking, highly-skilled jobs.","2. Educational attainment, which looks at female literacy, and women's access to and enrollment in both basic and higher education.","3. Political empowerment, which examines the number of women holding political office as well as the number of female heads of state over the last 50 years.","4. Health and survival, which is measured by comparing female and male life expectancy and mortality rates.","Each country out of the 136 is assigned a score between 1 (total equality) and 0 (total inequality) for each of the 14 indicators. The scores are then averaged to determine the overall rankings. According to the report's authors, the index scores represent the \"percentage of the gap that has been closed between women and men.\"","This year the United States ranked 23rd and received a score of 0.7392, nearly the same as in 2012 when the U.S. ranked 22nd with a score of .7373. Unfortunately, our ranking and score have both decreased since 2011. That year, the U.S. was ranked 17th, just behind the United Kingdom and just ahead of Canada, with a score of .7412.","Where the U.S. really seems to falter is not in educational attainment -- we have near-perfect gender equality when it comes to enrollment in primary, secondary and tertiary educational institutions. And though we ranked an abysmal 67th when it came to closing the wage gap, overall the U.S. ranked 6th for economic participation. But the U.S. has a serious gender issue when it comes to politics, receiving a score of .159 for overall political empowerment, mostly because we have so few women in legislative and ministerial positions. For example, women make up just 18.3 percent of the 113th Congress.","And of course, this report does not account for everything that makes up the quality of a woman's life. For example, it is illegal in both Nicaragua and the Philippines for women to terminate a pregnancy.","As always, these rankings show us the places where we have made incredible progress when it comes to gender parity in the U.S. -- and the areas where there is still much more work to be done.","Here are 22 countries that are more gender equal than the United States:","1.

{"postId":"4ospl7","postText":["[Th Guardian] We shoppers aren\u2019t to blame for food waste. Guess who is."],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["L ast year, ast year, Tesco\u2019s food waste mountain amounted to 59,400 tonnes . If you\u2019re finding that figure hard to envisage, it\u2019s the equivalent of 119m meals, and an increase of 4% on the year before. From this we can deduce that Tesco\u2019s voluble commitment to reducing its edible detritus has yet to yield results. But is Tesco any worse in this respect than any other supermarket chain? Probably wisely, the others don\u2019t publish their waste figures, but let\u2019s just assume that if they had a better story to tell us, we\u2019d already know all about it.","Tesco\u2019s waste tally is certainly grotesque, but PR executives expert in techniques for smoothing over corporate difficulties would doubtless applaud the masterly way Tesco deflected criticism. On the day that his chain\u2019s depressing results were published, chief executive Dave Lewis addressed a food industry summit where he exhorted food manufacturers to do more to reduce their waste across the supply chain.","After deftly passing the waste ball back to his supply base, Lewis reprised a favourite supermarket refrain: blame the consumer. \"While the majority of food waste arises from the home, industry recognises the need to lead by example.\" There you have the dramatis personae in Tesco\u2019s food waste script: profligate consumers, suppliers who earn a \"must work harder\" rating, and enlightened Tesco, leading the vanguard in the national war on waste.","Just in case you aren\u2019t finding the plot line 100% credible, a further emotional strand is woven in: Tesco promises to redistribute all its unsold edible food to charities from 2017. Putting a gloss on your waste problem by repackaging it as a food poverty solution is a tactic increasingly deployed by our major supermarkets. Ideally, from a supermarket PR point of view, the term \"food poverty\" would appear in every headline that contains \"supermarket food waste\", for that allows our giant retailers to bask in the role of philanthropists who use their corporate might for the common good. It places a halo of saintliness around all their business activities.","But a waste prevention strategy should never be confused with a poverty reduction strategy. Crumbs from the rich man\u2019s table is a shallow, and too easily self-aggrandising response to the unacceptable reality that millions of fellow citizens can\u2019t afford to eat good, fresh food. What\u2019s more, the red herring of food poverty draws attention further away from one essential fact about supermarkets we must digest if we are ever to make any progress: waste is hard-wired into the supermarket system.","When the supermarkets began colonising the UK grocery market in the early 1980s, they appeared to be a newer, more efficient way of feeding the nation. They promised vast economies of scale by virtue of their collective buying power and state-of-the-art distribution logistics that would bring every agricultural product on the planet to our shelves, 365 days a year. This precision shopping model, we were assured, would produce dividends for consumers in the form of lower prices and more convenient shopping. Who needs parades of small, independent shops when chains can feed us so much more efficiently, and for less?","Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese; now we live in dread of food poisoning","Four decades on, it\u2019s becoming obvious that supermarkets are incapable of delivering this promise. Why? They are retail dinosaurs, locked into a system that\u2019s riddled with problems.","One such glaring issue is food waste. Far from discouraging it, the supermarket business model actively begets it.","There aren\u2019t, to my knowledge, any robust statistics on levels of food waste in British households before the supermarket era, but I\u2019d hazard a guess that they were much lower than they are now.","Our rubbish bins really started filling up when, instead of shopping for a little, as was needed, every day or two, we were persuaded to adopt the one-stop supermarket shopping trip. Theoretically, armed with a list, we could buy all the food we needed for a week. Nowadays, supermarket online ordering makes that even easier to do. Just press the same-as-last-week option. So supermarkets egg us on to overlook what we already have and to buy much more than we need. They encourage us to hazard a weekly guess about what we\u2019ll consume, rather than focusing on what\u2019s in our fridges and larders day-to-day.","If the untouched remnants of last week\u2019s order are stacking up in the fridge when the supermarket van arrives at our door, most people will consign them to the bin, schooled to believe, thanks to supermarket use by and best before dates, that judging freshness is best left to distant experts. Once we sniffed the milk and pared mould off cheese, now we live in dread of poisoning. Better safe than sorry, surely?","But sell-by dates \u2013 the progenitor of use by and best before \u2013 were introduced by supermarkets as stock rotation tools, to help clunky, mammoth chains keep tabs on the unprecedented amount of product passing through their system, not primarily as safeguards against food poisoning.","Undoubtedly, certain foods sold by supermarkets do pose a very real risk to health. Around two thirds of their raw chickens are contaminated with potentially lethal campylobacter at the point of sale, even though they are well within their use-by dates. Yet again supermarkets point the finger of blame at the stupid, sloppy home cook who fails to slay the bacteria through thorough cooking, rather than eradicating infection at their factory farms.","And don\u2019t forget that supermarkets have actively undermined our national food handling experience and skill by telling us that we\u2019re too \"time poor\" to cook from scratch, largely because it is much more profitable for them to sell us value-added, processed foods whose apparent freshness is validated by reassuring dates. The bottom line here is that such dates are absolutely no guarantee that food is truly fresh or safe, yet they shape our daily decisions about what we eat and what we bin.","Battalions of quangos, non-governmental organisations, government agencies and charities see supermarkets as allies in the war on food waste, but in reality, they are a huge part of the problem. If we are to stop waste at source, we must look to and learn from the burgeoning grassroots initiatives that aim to relocalise and scale down our food chain."],"targetTitle":"We shoppers aren\u2019t to blame for food waste.

They have to buy whatever books they're assigned,\" Nicole Allen, a spokeswoman for the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, told NBC.","Some publishers contest the idea that textbook prices have risen exorbitantly, claiming that what may look like stark increases in percentages actually represent more modest increases in whole dollars.","Still, students and experts following the trend say that the prices are becoming prohibitively expensive.","And the high prices are beginning to discourage some students from purchasing textbooks for their classes, despite the fact that they realize it may hurt their grades.","The US Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) conducted a survey of 156 different college campuses across 33 states and found that 65% of students decided against buying a book required for class due to its high cost. And 94% of those students acknowledged that they were afraid that the move would hurt their grade.","\"The textbooks market is broken and students are paying the price,\" Ethan Senack, a higher-education associate at US PIRG, told US News & World Report in 2014.","\"[Students] can't shop around and find the most affordable option, meaning there's no consumer control on the market,\" Senack said.","They can, however, mitigate the rising cost of textbooks by looking for alternatives, such as buying used books and selling their books after the course has come to an end."],"targetTitle":"One of the biggest ways college students are ripped off is getting out of control","targetDescription":"Textbooks are way too expensive.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/static5.businessinsider.de\/assets\/images\/de\/logos\/logo-print.png","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/18913\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/5419\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/static2.businessinsider.de\/image\/57cb117ddd0895a4528b456f-1024-682\/college-11.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/4459\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/5857b04acca1c7762029bc60-60-60\/bewerbershutterstock60.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3648\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/static6.businessinsider.de\/image\/564140b1dd0895c4188b462e-50-50\/abby-jackson.jpg","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/582c3a38cca1c7b21e0b12c3-556-156\/moneyou-logo-transparent.png","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3651\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/57cb117edd0895a4528b4570-851-562\/screen%20shot%202012-12-26%20at%203.07.11%20pm.png","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5857b178cdf4df736a14ab58-500-400\/ey-logo-horizontal.png","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5853ad8ecca1c7cf389ba041-600-257\/etoro.png","http:\/\/static1.businessinsider.de\/image\/57cb117fdd0895a4528b4572\/one-of-the-biggest-ways-college-students-are-ripped-off-is-getting-out-of-control.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/call\/pubi\/79630\/('post')\/3650\/S\/14886508621\/","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-103525h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/static4.businessinsider.de\/image\/57cb117edd0895a4528b4571-100-100\/one-of-the-biggest-ways-college-students-are-ripped-off-is-getting-out-of-control.jpg","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/5853ad19cdf4df847a27ac39-60-60\/robo-adviser.jpg","http:\/\/ww251.smartadserver.com\/imp?imgid=15552517&tmstp=1488654462","http:\/\/atsfi.de\/s.png?b=2","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/58887e2bf4c01d31008b52a3-1877-939\/oracle-hcm-logo-white.png","http:\/\/www.businessinsider.de\/image\/582c3bc9cca1c76d1a0b12c3-60-60\/sparenwachstumcarballoshutterstock60.jpg","https:\/\/static-ssl.businessinsider.de\/image\/5891fdaacca1c7fd0de51217-60-60\/blindkommunikation60x60.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/college-text-book-prices-are-getting-out-of-control-2016-9","id":34}

{"postId":"516pm8","postText":["How Stephen Hawking Has Lived So Long With ALS"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["An expert on Lou Gehrig's disease explains what we know about this debilitating condition and how Hawking has beaten the odds","Editor\u2019s Note: Renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking died on March 14, 2018, at age 76. This story, originally published on his 70th birthday on January 7, 2012, is being resurfaced to explain how he beat the odds and lived so long with the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","Stephen Hawking turns 70 on Sunday, beating the odds of a daunting diagnosis by nearly half a century.","The famous theoretical physicist has helped to bring his ideas about black holes and quantum gravity to a broad public audience. For much of his time in the public eye, though, he has been confined to a wheelchair by a form of the motor-neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). And since 1985 he has had to speak through his trademark computer system\u2014which he operates with his cheek\u2014and have around-the-clock care.","But his disease seems hardly to have slowed him down. Hawking spent 30 years as a full professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge. And he is currently the director of research at the school's Center for Theoretical Cosmology.","But like his mind, Hawking's illness seems to be singular. Most patients with ALS\u2014also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, for the famous baseball player who succumbed to the disease\u2014are diagnosed after the age of 50 and die within five years of their diagnosis. Hawking's condition was first diagnosed when he was 21, and he was not expected to see his 25th birthday.","Why has Hawking lived so long with this malady when so many other people die so soon after diagnosis? We spoke with Leo McCluskey, an associate professor of neurology and medical director of the ALS Center at the University of Pennsylvania, to find out more about the disease and why it has spared Hawking and his amazing brain.","What is ALS\u2014and is there more than one form of it?","ALS, which is also known as a motor-neuron disease\u2014and colloquially as Lou Gehrig's disease in the U.S.\u2014is a neurodegenerative disease. Each muscle is controlled by motor neurons that reside in the brain in the frontal lobe. These are controlled electrically and are synaptically connected to motor neurons that reside lower down in the brain\u2014as well as motor neurons that reside in the spinal cord. The guys in the brain are called the upper motor neurons, and the guys in the spine are called the lower motor neurons. The disease causes weakness of either upper motor neurons or lower motor neurons or both.","It's been known for quite some time that there are variants of ALS. One is referred to as progressive muscular atrophy, or PMA. It appears to be an isolated illness of the lower motor neurons. However, pathologically, if you do an autopsy of a patient, they will have evidence of deterioration of upper motor neurons.","There is also primary lateral sclerosis\u2014PLS\u2014and clinically it looks like an isolated upper motor-neuron disorder. However, pathologically they also have lower motor-neuron disorder.","The other classic syndrome is called progressive baldor palsy\u2014or progressive supranuclear palsy\u2014which is weakening of cranial muscles, like the tongue, face and swallowing muscles. But it pretty much always spreads to limb muscles.","Those are the four classic motor-neuron disorders that have been described. And it was thought for quite some time that these disorders were limited to motor neurons. It's now clear that that's not true. It's now well recognized that 10 percent of these patients can develop degeneration in another part of the brain, such as other parts of the frontal lobe that don't contain the motor neurons or the temporal lobe. So some of these patients can actually develop dementia, called frontal-temporal lobe dementia.","One of the misconceptions about ALS is that it's only a motor-neuron disease, and that's not true.","What has Stephen Hawking's case shown about the disease?","One thing that is highlighted by this man's course is that this is an incredibly variable disorder in many ways. On average people live two to three years after diagnosis. But that means that half the people live longer, and there are people who live for a long, long time.","Life expectancy turns on two things: the motor neurons running the diaphragm\u2014the breathing muscles. So the common way people die is of respiratory failure. And the other thing is the deterioration of swallowing muscles, and that can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. If you don't have these two things, you could potentially live for a long time\u2014even though you're getting worse. What's happened to him is just astounding. He's certainly an outlier.","Has he lived so long because he got the disease when he was young and had the juvenile-onset type?","Juvenile-onset is diagnosed in the teenage years, and I don't know enough about his course to say. But it's probably something similar to juvenile-onset disorder, which is something that progresses very, very, very slowly. I have patients in my clinic who were diagnosed in their teens and are still alive in their 40s, 50s or 60s. But not having ever examined him or taken a history, it's a little hard for me to say.","He's a very good example of the sparing of the non-motor parts of the brain that can occur.","How frequent are these cases of very slow-progressing forms of ALS?","I would say probably less than a few percent.","How much do you think Stephen Hawking's longevity has been due to the excellent care that he has received versus the biology of his particular form of ALS?","It's probably a little bit of both. I just know him from television, so I don't know what kind of interventions he's had. If he really isn't on a ventilator, then it's his biology\u2014it's the biology of his form of the neurodegenerative disease that determines how long he will live. For trouble swallowing you can elect to have a feeding tube placed, which basically takes malnutrition and dehydration off the table. But mostly it's about the biology of the disease.","Hawking obviously has quite the active mind, and previous statements that he has made seem to indicate he has a pretty positive mental outlook, despite his condition. Is there any evidence that lifestyle and psychological well-being do much to help with patients' outcomes? Or is the disease usually too quick for that to make a difference?","I don't believe that adds to longevity.","ALS still doesn't have a cure. What have we learned about the disease recently that might help us find one\u2014or at least better treatments?","Beginning in 2006 it became clear that like a lot of other neurodegenerative diseases, ALS was determined by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. Ten percent of ALS is genetic and based on a gene mutation. I'm sure there are also at-risk genes for ALS, but there are now multiple genes that have been identified as potentially causing the disease. Each one of them are interesting in that they lead to the accumulation of different proteins in the brain. Knowing specific genes gives us particular mechanisms in the brain, and would potentially give us targets for therapies. But none of this has given us any robust therapies yet.","What does Stephen Hawking's case mean for people who have the disease?","It's just an incredible, incredible example of the variability of the disease\u2014and the hope for patients who have it that they could also live a long life. Unfortunately, it's a small percentage of people for whom that actually happens."],"targetTitle":"How Has Stephen Hawking Lived Past 70 with ALS?","targetDescription":"50% of people diagnosed with ALS will live about 4 years.

After being heralded as \"the creation of a near-perfect blue pigment,\" this coincidental eureka moment is now being manufactured for artists\u2019 brushes.","This burst of blue came about when scientists at Oregon State University (OSU) heated manganese oxide, along with other chemicals, to over 1,200\u00b0C (2,000\u00b0F). Although the scientists were actually looking at manganese oxide for some of its electronic properties, one of their reactions inadvertently birthed a new pigment: the catchily named \"YInMn blue.\"","The findings of the original study were published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.","\"Basically, this was an accidental discovery,\" said Mas Subramanian, a Milton Harris professor of materials science in the OSU Department of Chemistry, in a statement. \"Our work had nothing to do with looking for a pigment.","He added: \"Then one day a graduate student who is working on the project was taking samples out of a very hot furnace while I was walking by, and it was blue, a very beautiful blue. I realized immediately that something amazing had happened.\"","So, what\u2019s so special about this blue?","This pigment is far more stable when exposed to heat or acidic conditions. Additionally, unlike Prussian blue or Cobalt blue pigments, it doesn\u2019t release cyanide and is not carcinogenic \u2013 that's always a plus. Not only that, the highly reflective properties of the new pigment means it could be used in paints that could help keep buildings cool by reflecting infrared light.","Subramanian told Artnet in a recent interview that the pigment has become a popular choice among artists because of its vivid color and resistant properties. The paint manufacturers Shepherd Color Company have also licensed a patent and is now selling samples of YInMn blue.","He added: \"Our pigment is useful for art restoration, because it is similar to ultramarine but really more durable.\"","[H\/T: Mental Floss]"],"targetTitle":"This New Shade Of Blue Was Accidentally Discovered By Chemists","targetDescription":"Chemists accidently created this bright blue pigment, which is now being used by artists for its durable properties.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-environment.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318082&cs=f932d0946b&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316406&cs=69f403dc56&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ilss-logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316414&cs=6c4ace3c1f&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo_narrow.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316385&cs=24a66e6205&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316330&cs=c58cc2de06&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=18981470&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-space.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ifls-placeholder.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316331&cs=ff36d3abd8&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-technology.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/2ac41d0c-9e37-536e-9496-6e31d22410a8\/author_large-1465396217-tom-hale.JPG","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-plants-and-animals.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-editors-blog.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/9d7ac88f-5df1-5499-a719-cb731bc072fd\/default-1467121318-cover-image.jpg","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318083&cs=075600f372&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-the-brain.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318081&cs=87fb1c7e69&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-chemistry.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=d6f5031c43&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=23fc1c635f&cb=1487689771","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-health-and-medicine.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-physics.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316354&cs=07106bb0fd&cb=1487689771"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.iflscience.com\/chemistry\/this-new-shade-of-blue-was-accidentally-discovered-by-chemists\/","id":39}
{"postId":"382166003905331200","postText":["Blocking this color light may help you sleep better"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well documented, and have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years -- with good reason. Nighttime exposure to artificial light -- which for the great majority of us happens without much thought or awareness -- disrupts the body's circadian rhythm, altering the 24-hour biological clock that controls our sleep-wake cycle. In addition to wreaking havoc with sleep, disruptions to circadian rhythms also have been associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer, diabetes, depression and heart disease.","In particular, research in recent years has shown that blue wavelength light is especially harmful to circadian rhythm function. Studies have shown that blue wavelength light has uniquely harmful effects on humans and suppresses melatonin levels more vigorously than other light wavelengths. Unfortunately, many energy-efficient light sources produce high concentrations of blue light. Blue light is emitted by electronic devices, energy-efficient light bulbs, and other common light sources.","Research investigating blue-light blocking -- most often in the form of goggles that filter out this particular wavelength of light -- has shown promise. A new study of cataract patients indicates that artificial lens implants can help improve sleep. Scientists at China's Sichuan University studied the effects of blue-light blocking artificial lenses implanted during cataract surgery. The study involved 40 patients who required surgery for cataracts in both eyes. Cataract surgery commonly involves removal of the eye's damaged lens and insertion of an artificial lens. Cataracts are a common condition among older adults -- approximately 60 percent of people over the age of 60 experience cataracts. The study subjects -- 26 women and 14 men, with an average age of 74 -- were given artificial lenses with blue-light blocking capability. Researchers assessed patients sleep quality before surgery and again two months after surgery. They found patients' sleep had improved significantly across several measures:","Patients were sleeping more during the night.","Their sleep quality had improved.","Their levels of daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness had diminished.","The number of subjects who met the criteria for \"poor sleepers\" had decreased.","Lens replacement surgery is necessary for cataract patients. But there are other, less-invasive ways to filter out blue-light that are also being investigated by sleep scientists. Research has shown the benefits to sleep of manipulating and controlling exposure to blue light:","A study of 20 adults who wore either blue-light blocking or ultraviolet-light blocking glasses for three hours before sleep found that both sleep quality and mood improved among those in the group who wore blue-light blocking glasses, compared to the ultraviolet-light blocking group.","Shift workers are at especially high risk for circadian rhythm disruptions because of their non-traditional schedules. In a study by scientists at Quebec's Universite Laval, nightshift workers used blue-light blocking glasses at or near the end of their overnight shifts for four weeks. At the end of study period, their overall sleep amounts increased, as did their sleep efficiency.","While nighttime exposure to blue wavelength light is damaging to circadian rhythms, exposure to blue light isn't always detrimental. Daytime exposure to blue light can stimulate alertness and help sleep later on. A study of 94 office workers found that daytime exposure to blue light during work hours resulted in improvements both to sleep and to daytime functioning, compared to exposure to white light. Subjects who were exposed to blue light experienced improvements to daytime alertness, mood, and concentration. These subjects also experienced decreases in daytime sleepiness and they slept better at night.","This area of research is critically important, and I expect we will see a great deal more investigation into the effects of blue wavelength light on sleep and health. But you don't need special goggles or eye lens implants to protect your circadian rhythms and your sleep from the negative effects of artificial light. Here are some low-tech suggestions that can help you:","Limit exposure to artificial light in the hours before bed. The last 1-2 hours before bed should be a time of winding down and preparing for sleep. Decreasing your exposure to light is an important part of this process. You don't have to sit in a pitch-black room, but you should think about beginning to limit your exposure to bright lights, whether from your computer screen or your television. Reading under moderate lamplight is fine. If you're using a tablet to read, bring the screen's brightness level down. Make the last 60 minutes of your bedtime ritual electronics-free -- and keep electronic gadgets and devices out of the bedroom altogether.","Get light exposure during the day. Daytime exposure to light -- both sunlight and artificial light -- can help strengthen circadian rhythms and boost daytime alertness, leaving you better prepared to sleep when the time comes.","If you need access to light in the middle of the night, use small nightlights. Rather than switching on hallway or bathroom lights -- and flooding your system with melatonin-suppressing light -- use low-illumination night lights to guide you when you need to get up in the dark.","Being aware of the effects of nighttime exposure to light and making some basic changes to bedtime routines can go a long way toward getting you the darkness you need to sleep well, even in this ever-bright modern age."],"targetTitle":"Blocking Blue Light Helps Sleep","targetDescription":"The disruptive effects of artificial light on sleep are well","targetKeywords":"light in bedroom,nightlight,blue light blocking lens,The Sleep Doctor,light exposure,circadian rhythm,electronics and sleep,Sleep Tips,sleep expert,Sleep Advice,bedtime routine,sleep habits,artificial light and sleep,Dr. Breus,blue wavelength,Electronics in Bedroom,blue light,michael breus,sleep,blue light sleep,artificial light sleep,blue light and sleep","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/51rWTZ2PAKL._SL160_.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41QKMIg7HvL._SL160_.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1361999\/images\/o-BLUE-LIGHT-SLEEP-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/big.assets.huffingtonpost.com\/ShopIndieRed.png","http:\/\/assets.huffingtonpost.com\/amazon-sidebar.gif","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1eBEXfW","id":40}

To put that into perspective, the US, on average, holds only 80 people per square mile. That much combined body odor alone could be enough to scare anyone away.","With such an insanely huge number of people living in just one city, it should come as no surprise that there is also an insanely huge amount of garbage produced.","Although residents of the city produce 12,000 tons of waste every day, New York City doesn\u2019t have any of its own landfills or incinerators. Garbage piles up in dumpsters until it can all be taken across the Hudson River to be incinerated in New Jersey, or, if possible, recycled locally and overseas.","But even after most of this waste has been incinerated across the river, strong winds can still carry the stench back over to the city on a hot day.","The sheer amount of garbage isn\u2019t the only problem. There also has to be a way to get all of it out of the city. Diesel trucks carry garbage out of Manhattan 7.8 million times each year. Let this sink in: That\u2019s the same as driving around the earth 312 times, and that's just for one city.","All this driving only adds to pollution and the greenhouse effect, causing the city to become warmer and smellier as time continues.","You may also be wondering why those subway vents on every block smell so much more putrid on a steamy summer day. Or how it is possible to smell a food cart from all the way down the street.","It turns out the combination of heat and humidity allow bacteria to grow faster and smells to travel further. Increasing temps mean molecules move faster, resulting in enzymes speeding up metabolism and cells quickly increasing in size. Heat is bacteria\u2019s best friend.","So when you get stuck with one those incredibly humid days, smells become only more potent. The water in the air causes these odors to dissolve, trapping them longer than if it were a dry day outside.","To many, New York is the city of dreams, but you have to be willing to accept it for the good, the bad, and the smelly."],"targetTitle":"Here's why New York City smells so rancid in the summer","targetDescription":"The Big Apple has some terrible smells in the summer.

Chances are, there would be nothing inside one of those that would make your day any better. But James Butler might disagree with you there.","James was strolling through Coonskin Park, a riverside sliver of nature located in Kanawha County, West Virginia, when he heard a strange noise coming from one of the dumpsters there. Curiosity piqued, he investigated, only to discover something that had him fumbling for his camera...","Retired West Virginia police officer and aviation enthusiast James Butler heard strange cries coming from a Charleston, West Virginia, dumpster on Tuesday, August 11, 2015. Curious, he investigated the sounds.","Right away, he noticed two things. Five raccoons were trapped inside the Coonskin Park trash receptacle, and one of those raccoons was like nothing he'd ever seen before.","As to how they got stuck, James said, \"The dumpster had apparently been emptied and the garbage level was low and the raccoons couldn\u2019t reach the top to get back out.\" And that rare raccoon?","He didn't really look like like his family members\u2014or like any raccoon James had ever seen! This trashmonger was an albino raccoon, an incredibly rare specimen according to the Indiana Division of Fish and Wildlife. How rare, exactly?","The organization stated only one in 750,000 raccoons inherit the albino gene, a mutation that means the animal creates no melanin and therefore has no pigmentation. Stunned by his find, James didn't forget the real trouble at hand\u2014these raccoons were stuck.","Thinking quickly, James fabricated a little something to help the raccoons escape their trash pit prison: a wood plank. He leaned it on the inside of the dumpster, and the raccoons could use it like a ramp! They were free\u2014but that brought consequences.","The albino raccoon had been \"a well-kept secret\" in Coonskin Park, according to Rodney Jones, chief of Kanawha's Park Police Department. And once James shared his pictures online, Officer Jones feared it would become the subject of the public's curious cameras...","\"Now that the albino\u2019s getting publicity,\" Rodney said, \"I figure people will start looking to see if they can find it around the park.\" And people searching for a wild animal\u2014with a wild animal's instincts\u2014can be trouble.","\"We try to tell people with animals to keep their distance and don\u2019t try to feed them,\" he said after emphasizing that raccoons carry deadly diseases. \"I'd really hate to see an animal like that be destroyed because of someone\u2019s curiosity or stupidity.\"","Worse, the albino raccoon's appearance can make it a \"prize\" in the eyes of some people. Something special that needs to be captured or owned. Such was the case with a four-year-old albino raccoon in Georgia...","For part of her early life, Isis the albino raccoon had a miserable existence. Because of her unique look, someone captured her and locked her in a small, wire cage, intending to use her for a taxidermy project. Luckily, there was good news in store for her...","The Georgia Department of Natural Resources rescued Isis and delivered the raccoon to Maxine Rainey, below, director of the Georgia animal sanctuary, A New Hope. But both the sanctuary and the department of natural resources feared she was a lost cause...","Understandably, Isis was aggressive. Human touch scared her, and she lashed out at anyone trying to help her. \"Since she was described as so aggressive,\" Maxine said, \"we were just going to hold her for a couple of days.\" But then what?","When Maxine accepted the albino raccoon, she gave the poor animal a look over: she had urine burns, smelled horrendous, was obese, losing hair, and had sores all over her feet. No wonder she was aggressive. Maxine, though, had hope for the poor animal.","She sat in the enclosure with the animal that, by all accounts, should've been trying to tear her head off if she got too close. But amazingly, that didn't happen.","\"I'd been going through some stuff in my personal life, Maxine said, \"and I was kind of having a sad day, so I...sat by her and she came right up to me....she came up and sniffed me, and put her little hands in my hand.\" From there, the raccoon's life only got better.","\"She's so gentle,\" Maxine said. \"She spent the last couple days glued to my side, sleeping on my lap, having me carry her around...I just saw a complete 180-degree flip in her personality the minute she was exposed to some kindness.\"","For a raccoon once deemed so aggressive she had to be kept away from other raccoons at the facility, that's a pretty glowing review! But the story of Isis only underscored the worry of Rodney Jones, the chief of Kanawha\u2019s Park Police Department...","People like James Butler are often fascinated with animals that are different and unique, but it's important to remember they're wild animals\u2014potentially dangerous and capable of love and affection.

{"postId":"618428639483424768","postText":["We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["It's hard to look at BuzzFeed without being reminded of your mortality. The site spits out a seemingly never-ending bucket list of things we absolutely must do before we die: places to see, books to read, urinals to pee in. And as we all inch closer to our imminent deaths, BuzzFeed creates more and more of these articles, making it seemingly impossible to accomplish all of these things before we kick the can.","If you're as young and bored as I am, though, you might wonder: Could you pull it off? Could you actually check everything off the BuzzFeed bucket list, and if so, how long would it take? A little while ago, I set out to find out for myself. Here's how I did it:","First, I had to compile all of the lists BuzzFeed has published in its \"Before You Die\" format. At the time I filed this story, there were 182 lists. These ranged from appreciating the little things in life (like watching the sunset) to full-blown adventures (like going to South Africa's version of Burning Man). BuzzFeed writers also seem obsessed with food, since practically every other list is about stuffing your face with 21 amazing Aussie burgers or the ten best New Orleans po-boys or the 15 best cheese toasties in London.","Next, I cataloged each task on each of the 182 lists. There are over a thousand individual tasks.","On Motherboard: Counting the Hours I've Spent on the Internet","Next, I calculated the time it would take to complete each of the tasks. This is where it all got slightly more complicated, since the time it would take to do most of these things is highly individualized. Eating fish and chips, for example\u2014how long does that take the average person? If you were really vying for time, you could probably scarf some down in five minutes, but I'd much prefer to spend an hour savoring of a nice, greasy plate. And what if the restaurant was really busy and it took a long time for your server to bring the fish and chips to you? I settled on 30 minutes for eating fish and chips, as well as the other food-related tasks.","Other tasks required a fair amount of research, like hiking the Camino de Santiago, otherwise known as St. James' path, between Spain and France, which is less like a path and more like a pilgrimage. The trail is nearly 500 miles long. According to the trail's official website, it takes four to six weeks to complete. I decided to allot 30 days to complete the trail, even though the website also noted that you would need to hike 18 miles per day without any rest days to finish the trail in that time, which seems completely insane.","I repeated this process for every single task on Buzzfeed's lists. Again, there are over a thousand individual tasks.","Here is a time table showing a small sample of the time I allotted for certain tasks:","Some of the lists contained fast, easy tasks that be completed entirely from your couch\u2014like this one, which requires you to look at 20 pictures of miniature pigs before you die\u2014but for most of them, you have to travel. Some of the lists, like the Five Highest Places to Visit Before You Die, require you to jet-set from the Haiku Stairs of Oahu, Hawaii to the Petronas Towers of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to the Taihang Mountains in China. In order to accomplish all of the tasks most effectively, you would need to travel the world. So I decided to calculate the travel time that it would take to work your way around the world, in an order most efficient for accomplishing each of the BuzzFeed tasks.","I decided to begin my hypothetical bucket-list journey in Boston, where I live, and work my way west through North America. I would visit 36 states in the United States and stop in Canada and Mexico along the way. Then onto the Dominican Republic to explore the three shipwrecks of Bayahibe, followed by stops at Turks and Caicos, and Belize. Some stops later, I'd spend 175 hours and ten minutes flying from country to country in Europe, stopping in Estonia to see the beech tree in Hiiumaa before taking a quick ten-minute flight over to Finland to go to the Kontula indoor skatepark in Helsinki. I'd make my way over to Turkey to swim in the crystal blue mineral waters of the Pamukkale Springs in Hierapolis and then pop over to Jordan to grab a drink at the Cave Bar in Petra.","I whittled the travel time down to one-hour flights over borders, stopping in some countries for only a few minutes to visit a bakery or for a few hours to watch a sports game. In total, the round-the-world trip would take 26 days in travel time alone, and would include 108 countries.","The last thing I calculated was sleep time. I figured a person would be fairly tired after spending months on end climbing mountains, reading plays, and visiting museums every day, so I allotted the doctor-recommended eight hours per night. I really enjoy sleeping, so this is painful for me to even imagine, but when you're racing to finish an extensive bucket-list in the fastest amount possible, I suppose luxuriating in the REM cycle shouldn't be a priority. I also factored in how long it took me to calculate the trip\u2014around 40 hours in total\u2014and how long it would take to actually book the flights, hotels, and day-trips, which would be possibly twice that.","In conclusion\u2014drumroll, please\u2014I determined it would take 1,448.7 days to do everything that BuzzFeed says you need to do before you die. That's 207 weeks, or just shy of four years.","I'll repeat that some of the timing calculations were arbitrary. You could get stuck in a restaurant with poor service and it might take double the time to eat your fish and chips, or you could arrive somewhere like the Trinity Church on King George Island in Antarctica and decide it was too boring to stay the full hour. Your flights could get delayed, or you could get food poisoning at one of the restaurants and choose to bail on the next day's activities. If you got the timing wrong, you might miss the small window when all 39 Christmas markets on the list are open, or arrive at the Mendenhall Ice Caves in Juneau, Alaska, to find that they have all melted.","But if you planned it just right and you had the time, money, and stamina to accomplish everything on the list, then you could definitely do it.","That said, I'm not sure why anyone would want to. There are a lot of things on that list that I, personally, have no interest in doing. Why should I visit 39 different Christmas markets across Europe? I mean, I'm sure they're beautiful and each have nice hot chocolate and giant, neon candy canes, but what's the harm in not seeing all 39 of them? Is it really worth the hours it would take to learn all 44 of these air guitar songs? Would I really be a lesser person for not having visited these 19 penis-shaped objects around the world?","I'm not saying I wouldn't do it. If someone offered me the chance to travel the world and see some of the coolest things this Earth has to offer, I'd be hard pressed to say no. Of course, I'll probably die before that happens. BuzzFeed has a handy quiz for that, too."],"targetTitle":"We Calculated How Long It Would Take to Do Everything BuzzFeed Tells You to Do Before You Die","targetDescription":"Could you pull it off?

He\u2019s like Tim Tebow, but Wilson doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s going back to baseball any time soon. At age 27 there is definitely more to come for the Seattle Seahawks quarterback. Not only does he have two Super Bowl appearances and a championship to his name, but he just earned another ring after tying the knot with Ciara.","With the Seahawks in the middle of training camp and only three days away from their preseason opener against the Chiefs, we had a chance to chat with Wilson about a recent commercial he shot with Bose for their QuietComfort35 headphones. Over the phone, the three-time Pro Bowler and Super XLVIII Champion talked about his unusual\u2014at least for your average NFL player\u2019s standards\u2014taste in music, the future of the Seattle Seahawks, and how married life is treating him.","So what is this Bose commercial looking like?","It\u2019s gonna be a good commercial. I\u2019m not giving away too much, I want people to see it first. Kinda can\u2019t tell too much, but it was a great commercial. It\u2019s so much fun shooting those commercials, especially with Bose. They\u2019re very first class in everything they do, and I\u2019m a big music person, as you know. I listen to tons of music, and we always have music playing around the house, Ciara and I, but also on the field, too. I have the wireless headphones in the locker room and the training room, and we listen to music when we\u2019re watching film, all those things, so I\u2019m constantly just listening to music. I think it can bring me a sense of peace and allows me to cancel out all the noise. I just like focusing on the things I need to focus on.","You have one song to listen to before kickoff, what\u2019re you listening to?","That\u2019s a great question. \"I\u2019m Gonna Be Ready\" by Yolanda Adams . That\u2019s probably my go-to song. Before a game, I\u2019m always listening to gospel music. I\u2019m just so grateful on game day. I don\u2019t try to be all amped up. I try to be calm as can be and just grateful that I can play the game. It\u2019s a special, special day, those days.","So you\u2019re not listening to Drake, Eminem, or anyone like that before kickoff?","Nah, I\u2019m chillin\u2019 out.","The NFL said they\u2019re going to teach referees to call questionable catches incomplete if they aren\u2019t 100 percent sure. You\u2019ve been a part of questionable catches, how do you feel about what the NFL is trying to do?","I think ultimately the NFL and all the players, we just want it to be called the right way, whatever that is. That\u2019s the simplicity of it. It\u2019s not that complicated. I think the biggest thing is, the referees, they always want to make the right call, and us as players, we always want them to make the right call as well.

I\u2019m just so grateful on game day. I don\u2019t try to be all amped up.","In the last four years, you have faced a division rival in the playoffs. What\u2019s it like to face a team in the division in the postseason?","Our division, in my opinion, is one of the hardest divisions, for sure, the NFC West. So many talented players, so many talented teams. When you go against the 49ers twice a year, you go against the Rams twice a year, you go against the Arizona Cardinals twice a year, that\u2019s not an easy conference, but we try to...the ultimate goal for us is to go 1-0 every week and to block out all the noise and to focus on one game in a week. That\u2019s a big part of my philosophy, and our team philosophy is just to go 1-0 every week and just try to win that one game and see what happens.","You were ranked 17th in the NFL Top 100. Where would you rank yourself, and what do you have to do to be ranked higher next year?","That\u2019s not for me to worry about. All I care about is our team winning; that\u2019s the only thing that matters. The rest will handle itself. That\u2019s my only focus, man. All that stuff like I said, I just try to block out all that noise, ignore the noise, and like I said, winning a game, and a big part of that is kind of my regimen\u2014how I get ready for the offseason, how I get ready for a game, and the focus you put into all the hard work that you put into everything you do, and Bose definitely plays a part of that; my music plays a major part of that.","What did you make of the Hall of Fame Game being canceled?","I think it was the right decision in terms of players safety. It always comes down to players\u2019 safety.","There was the big blockbuster trade where you guys got Jimmy Graham last year. You guys were ranked low in tight end receptions, and Jimmy only had 48 catches in 11 games. How come his numbers went down?","Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t get to play the whole season. Kinda holds him back, but we always wanna get better, and we always wanna do more. So we\u2019re looking forward to him being back out there on the field. He\u2019s gonna do a great job.","How much did Marshawn Lynch mean to this team and your play?","Marshawn\u2019s a great football player. He\u2019s always gonna be well respected across the league. Now, guys gotta step up, and we can\u2019t wait. We have a great team, we have a lot of great players. I\u2019m excited about the running back group that we have stepping in. Those guys are gonna do a great job, and we\u2019re looking forward to having a great season.","Are you concerned the Legion of Boom won\u2019t last much longer with more free agency talks and contracts coming up for them?","I think the Legion of Boom is going to be great once again. I\u2019m excited about all the things that they\u2019re gonna do this year. Our team, just in general, our offense and defense and special teams\u2014you take it one day at a time.","Congratulations on the marriage, how is the married life?","It\u2019s a blessing man, to find someone so special, so sweet. She\u2019s one of the best people you can ever meet, one of the best moms you can ever meet. I\u2019m just grateful for that.","Your celebrity has reached new heights. From third-round pick out of college to a couple Super Bowl appearances as the quarterback of one of the best teams in the league\u2014so what is the craziest headline you have ever heard about yourself?","Awh man, I don\u2019t pay attention to any of that stuff. I\u2019m just grateful I get to play the game of football. I\u2019m just grateful I get to take the God-given ability that God has given me and just spread it across to my teammates and for us to play together and try to hopefully win another Super Bowl, and that\u2019s kind of my singular focus.

Get in a classroom and watch children solve problems at their desks (sometimes ON them) with them and really engage in the process because it all of a sudden became colorful and perhaps a little bit taboo.","You think you have to buy too many glue sticks? I invite you to join a class when they do a simple sorting and gluing project that gives the kids one more opportunity to understand all the \"-augh\" words and their various pronunciations and watch multiple children go through half a stick just for that one project.","More is more, right? And yes, the theory is that you teach them to use less, but let\u2019s be honest: some just use what they use. Watch kids \"clean\" the floor at the end of the day and, in a rush to get home, throw away all the \"trash\" they found, which includes half used pencils and crayons that would take too long to find a home for.","So, let\u2019s fast forward to January. The supplies are no longer new and shiny, and more than a few have met their untimely trash can demise. Used and broken crayons look better in that circular file than in pencil boxes. Glue sticks that still have some in them but are not the easiest to use just aren\u2019t worth it anymore. Markers find new homes in backpacks. Pencils that have no erasers have lost their appeal. Dry erase markers are dried up because they have been used to solve, spell, create. And then what happens?","Supplies that were an extra $10 from you at the beginning of the year for one kid become extras in your kid\u2019s teacher\u2019s cart at Target during a grocery run. And forget the $10. Oh no. Multiply that sucker by \u2013 how many kids were in that classroom? Was it 20? 30? Let\u2019s see.","Does your job ask you to shell out a couple hundred bucks to upgrade your software or buy staples? And if it\u2019s teaching your kid how to multiply better or be able to compose a sentence without referring to spell check, isn\u2019t that extra $10 a little worth it?","I\u2019m frustrated by our entitlement. We act like we\u2019re doing the schools and the teachers a favor when we fill that backpack with tissues and markers.","Umm, let\u2019s back up a minute. Aren\u2019t they the ones doing us the favor?","I mean, are we willing to take a step (or 200) backward and fill in gaps caused by something as silly as a distracted kid (who then distracts others) because he can\u2019t find a glue stick to finish his project? And yes, we went through school without some of these things, but these kids are more accustomed to bright and shiny. Maybe sad, but still true. And if bright and shiny go away, attention spans shorten, and kids are more disruptive. And guess what? Kids don\u2019t learn as well then.","I\u2019m frustrated that we can\u2019t see just how big a job these incredibly underpaid teachers are undertaking. So, my suggestion is to watch for sales and stock up. Buy the extra box of tissues. Do the right thing and thank that teacher for all the efforts to make our future decision-makers great ones.

This one added multiplayer, and they decided to release it close to the Steam Summer Sale, to drum up additional interest. Sounds like it worked. They explained:","\"I mentioned earlier how timing was an issue for Giants, and I believe we have learnt our lesson. We stuck to our deadlines, used a faster service to do our shortened localization, and we released the MultiPrayer DLC during the Steam Summer Sale. Our sales this month had a +1572% increase from the previous month on Steam, and while the sale is likely the main culprit here, we still think combining the two was the jackpot.\"","They\u2019ve since released another piece of DLC that\u2019s, well, not really DLC at all.

Free DLC can be good for players and developers, but developers have to be strategic about it.","\"The Indie market is a tough one,\" they wrote. \"If like us, you have a small team, limited resources and a tight budget that simply cannot stretch to huge marketing campaigns, you need to think outside the box.

(To support his claim, he points, in part, to the show's lack of an audience in Russia.)","To some degree, this is true. Back when the series debuted, the media wrote about Mad Men to a level far exceeding its actual ratings. The first season's viewership numbers dipped below the 1 million mark a few times \u2014 a much more perilous event in an age when DVRs and streaming services were less prevalent. But by season two, the awards and critical attention Mad Men garnered ended up boosting those numbers to more comfortable levels, and even if the show was never a smash hit, it had a long, healthy run.","Still, there are a bunch of good, mostly reductive reasons for the media to keep, in Idov's words, shoving Mad Men down readers' throats. Here are five.","1) Readers wanted to read about it","In my pre-Vox life, I was the TV editor of The A.V. Club, a position that gave me unique insight into what sorts of TV content readers wanted to consume. And every time we wrote about Mad Men, those numbers spiked. The show was consistently among the top five series we wrote about in terms of readership, and a well-timed thinkpiece always had the potential to blow up.","The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle","This has carried right over to Vox. We write a lot about the show because there's a huge audience out there ready to devour Mad Men content \u2014 far beyond any other show I've written about here that's not Game of Thrones. The Mad Men audience overlaps so neatly with the audience of people who read about TV on the internet that the Venn diagram of the two might as well be a single circle.","Yes, the huge explosion of commentary in the days preceding the show's finale was driven by how much many of us in the media liked the show. But it was also driven by the fact that our readers wanted to see this sort of material. Some of that was an accident of timing.","2) Mad Men debuted right after The Sopranos ended and filled the void the show left","When Mad Men began, in the summer of 2007, The Sopranos had ended just a few weeks before. The Wire (never as popular in terms of raw readership numbers, though no slouch itself) would end in early 2008. Lost was the king of the recap roost at the time, but those who wrote about it usually focused more on grand, unified theories of why the show worked, rather than the sorts of symbolic interpretations The Sopranos invited.","Mad Men also benefitted from the rise of TV recapping in general","Thus, there was a huge opening in the \"reading about TV on the internet\" marketplace that was beginning to boom in the late 2000s, and Mad Men filled it as surely as it filled the slots vacated by Sopranos at the Golden Globes and the Emmys. The two shows' thematic concerns, use of dreamlike imagery, and storytelling structure were incredibly similar, which only helped matters.","But Mad Men also benefited from the rise of TV recapping in general. Alan Sepinwall began his seminal blog What's Alan Watching in late 2005, and by that final Sopranos season, dozens of publications were dipping their toes into the recap waters. That number would explode in years to come \u2014 and Mad Men was a natural fit for publications that wanted to write TV recaps and people who wanted to read them.","3) There just wasn't as much good TV on","When Mad Men started, it was popular to suggest that the end of The Sopranos, the cancellation of HBO's Deadwood, and the impending end of The Wire signaled the end of TV's Golden Age. (Sound familiar?) Instead, Mad Men and later Breaking Bad picked up that ball and ran with it, while FX entered the early stages of a hot streak that continues to this day.","But, really, in that summer of 2007, the established shows worth writing about were few and far between \u2014 especially if you didn't want to publish weekly, in-depth reviews of comedies (a later development, largely driven by content-hungry sites like, well, The A.V. Club). They were essentially limited to The Wire, Dexter, Lost, Heroes, 24, Grey's Anatomy, and maybe Veronica Mars (if your readership was especially young). Thus, it was easy to get the \"serious TV\" audience to tune in to Mad Men, because there weren't a ton of other options.","Mad Men suggested every cable channel should have its own scripted drama series in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do","Contrast that to today, when a show like The Americans can't get the same sort of readership traction as Mad Men (even though it has a loyal, dedicated audience that likes reading about it), simply because there's so much more stuff out there. This most recent season of that FX drama received the kind of acclaim Mad Men did in its heyday \u2014 but it's much, much harder for a series to cut through the noise from all those other shows out there. Mad Men suggested every single cable channel should have its own scripted drama in development \u2014 and now they pretty much all do.","4) Mad Men was actually pretty popular, when all was said and done","Though it never pulled in Big Bang Theory numbers, AMC told Vulture's Joe Adalian that at the show's height, a total of just under 7 million people watched it. That number's not insignificant, and even a tiny percentage of that audience consistently reading pieces about the show online would be more than enough to drive significant traffic to most websites \u2014 especially back in 2007, when the overall online readership was smaller.","5) Never underestimate passion","As my colleague Matthew Yglesias wrote about the popularity of Bernie Sanders' presidential candidacy online, a small but rabidly passionate audience for a particular topic can be lifeblood to a website that craves readers. What holds true for Sanders is also true for Mad Men: there are very few casual Mad Men fans. And those passionate fans tend to seek out everything they can find about the show.","Early on, the media positioned Mad Men as a sort of lifestyle choice","The media is, of course, at least somewhat complicit in this. Early on, we positioned the series as a sort of lifestyle choice \u2014 if you were cool, you would watch Mad Men. But TV sites have said that about a lot of shows over the years, and few of them held up, readership-wise, as well as Mad Men did. (Whither Boardwalk Empire?) Yes, the early push might have been a bit much, but Mad Men ended up having the goods \u2014 at least for the people who cared about it.","I agree with the theoretical concerns behind the criticisms of media coverage of Mad Men. Those of us who write about television do too often ignore the shows that a majority of Americans are actually watching, shows like The Big Bang Theory and NCIS and even Empire.","But the kinds of people who read our websites are also far more likely to want to take a deep dive into the latest episode of Mad Men than they are to want to read a careful analysis of even several episodes of NCIS. (Believe me. I've tried.) The answer to why the media keeps pushing Mad Men on the people is simple: the people keep pushing it on us."],"targetTitle":"The real reason people write so much about Mad Men: you keep clicking","targetDescription":"The show hit at just the right time to ride the growing TV recap boom.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53520017\/625496290.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/qRSlOihPEVuoFYY3bczwYfHTHE0=\/576x0:3600x2016\/1200x800\/filters:focal(576x0:3600x2016)\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/46358696\/e91a27d7-7779-a797-8ea8-6ba397e972e7_MM_714_JM_0623_1545.0.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53529619\/_94928968_originalpic.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53527277\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53484121\/medicine1.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/thumbor\/jcIKfVCivl71No-eC-i8ZS8TfBU=\/0x9:3600x2009\/1080x600\/cdn0.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/46358696\/e91a27d7-7779-a797-8ea8-6ba397e972e7_MM_714_JM_0623_1545.0.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53525779\/zeldabreath.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53521487\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_2.18.56_PM.0.png","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs","https:\/\/cdn2.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53535527\/GettyImages_647615482.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53519805\/shutterstock_554313283.0.jpg","https:\/\/cdn1.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53532165\/arnold.0.png","https:\/\/cdn3.vox-cdn.com\/uploads\/chorus_image\/image\/53527277\/Screen_Shot_2017_03_03_at_6.39.44_PM.1488585270.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/vox.com\/e\/8389932?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter","id":52}

Here are 5 foods to eat and avoid"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["High fat, low fat, no carb, more carb: when it comes to getting information on eating to manage high blood cholesterol, confusion reigns.","We checked the most recent research from trials that tested the impact of specific foods on blood cholesterol. ","The verdict? Good news first! Eating more nuts, legumes, plant sterols (molecules found in plants) and olive oil helps lower blood cholesterol.","The bad news? Discretionary foods (aka junk) raise blood cholesterol, especially bad cholesterol (called LDL). Eating less lowers it.","Do you know your blood cholesterol level? If you don't, ask your GP to check it. Over a third of Australian adults have high cholesterol.","1. Eat legumes ","Legumes and pulses, including baked beans, kidney beans, chick peas, lentils and split peas, can help lower cholesterol levels.","The most recent Australian Health Survey found fewer than one in five Australians ate them on the day of the survey.","The results of 26 randomised control trials (the gold standard of research trials), which included 1,037 people who had either normal or high cholesterol levels, were added together. ","The data showed LDL cholesterol was reduced by 5 percent in response to eating 130 grams of pulses per day. ","This is equivalent to one small can or about a third of a 400 gram (large) can of baked beans.","Pulses are high in vegetable protein and fibre. They lower blood cholesterol in a number of ways. ","The soluble and insoluble fibres assist with lowering cholesterol absorption in the gut, while they promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in the large bowel.","Legumes and pulses take longer to digest compared to processed foods. This means you tend to eat less when they're part of a meal.","2. Eat plant sterols, margarines and spreads ","Plant sterols, or phytosterols, are chemically similar to blood cholesterol and are found in some plant foods, including nuts. ","They are concentrated from plant sources and then added to some commonly eaten foods such as margarines, spreads or milk.","Plant sterols compete with two other types of cholesterol for absorption from the gut: pre-made cholesterol, which is found in some foods like prawns, and cholesterol, which is made in your liver. ","This 'competition' process lowers the total amount of cholesterol that eventually ends up in your blood.","A review concluded that two grams of plant sterols a day leads to an 8-10 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol.","The type of fat the plant sterols are mixed with is important. ","A meta-analysis of 32 randomised control trials, involving around 2,100 people, found bigger reductions in total cholesterol (a mix of good and bad types) and LDL cholesterol when plant sterols were added to margarines or spreads derived from canola or rapeseed oil, rather than sunflower or soybean oil.","3. Eat nuts ","Nuts are high in protein and fat, but the amounts of polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fat vary. ","In a review of 25 intervention trials, eating approximately 67g of nuts a day (about half a cup) led to a 5.1 percent reduction in total cholesterol and 7.4 percent for LDL.","It didn't matter what type of nuts people ate; the more nuts, the bigger the cholesterol reduction. ","People with higher LDL cholesterol at baseline or who were not overweight had a bigger improvement. ","One caution is that half a cup of nuts contains about 400 calories (1600kJ), so you need to eat nuts instead of another food, or eat less each day but have them every day.","4. Use olive oil ","Olive oil is a major component of the Mediterranean diet and the predominant source of fat. Olive oil contains a high proportion of monounsaturated fat.","More than 80 percent of olive oil's healthy compounds (called phenolic compounds) are lost during the refining process, so less refined varieties, such as virgin olive oil, are a better choice.","A review of eight trials that included 350 people consuming high phenolic olive oil found medium effects on lowering blood pressure and small effects on lowering oxidised LDL (a type of LDL), with no significant effects on total or LDL cholesterol.","In contrast, another trial randomly selected over 7,400 men and women at high risk of heart disease to follow three diets: the Mediterranean diet plus extra-virgin olive oil, or Mediterranean diet plus nuts, or a control diet (low fat). ","After 4.8 years follow-up, those in both the olive oil and nut groups had a 30 percent lower risk of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease compared to controls.","In a recent trial, 47 men and women were randomised to substitute 4.5 percent of their usual foodintake of olive oil or butter for five weeks, and then crossed over to the other group for another five weeks. ","Researchers found total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher after consuming butter compared to olive oil.","The reduction was biggest in those who had high blood cholesterol to start with. Switching to a healthier spread makes sense for those with high cholesterol.","5. Avoid junk food ","In our study, we found people were able to make a number of smaller changes across a range of the foods that lower blood cholesterol levels, including increasing nuts, soy foods and plant sterols.","But the biggest change people made was cutting back on energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods (junk foods) and eating a wider variety of healthy foods. ","The benefits of making these changes? They lowered their cholesterol, lost weight and lowered their blood pressure.","A big study examined changes in diet quality scores and heart disease risk in 29,000 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and 51, 000 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2010). ","After four years of follow-up almost 11,000 people had a heart disease 'event'.","Those who had the biggest improvement in their diet quality score had a 7-8% lower risk. You can check your diet quality using our Healthy Eating Quiz.","When it comes to heart disease risk factors, get your cholesterol and blood pressure checked next time you see your GP."],"targetTitle":"Do YOU have high cholesterol?

Scientists were very concerned and deeply disturbed as to what they found inside the unfortunate whales.","Wadden Sea National Park located in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well. Clearly, with this much debris in a whales stomach, there is no possible way for them to digest and get the nutrition necessary in order to survive. Having a full stomach and dying of starvation is one of the cruelest ways any marine animal could perish. The press release that was given fromlocated in Schleswig-Holstein, shows that many of the stranded whales stomachs were actually filled to the brim with plastic debris, which includes a 70 cm piece of plastic known to be apart of a car, a 13-meter-long fishing net, and a variety of other plastic debris that was found as well.

People on the other hand, however, believe that this is what happens when humanity continues to disregard marine life as well as the overabundance of plastic that is now circulating all over our oceans.","Environment minister for the state of Schleswig-Holstein, Robert Habeck states:","\"These findings show us the results of our plastic-oriented society. Animals inadvertently consume plastic and plastic waste, which causes them to suffer, and at worst, causes them to starve with full stomachs.\"","I n addition to this statement, Nicola Hodgkins who is affiliated with Whale and Dolphin Conservation states:","\"Although the large pieces will cause obvious problems and block the gut, we shouldn't dismiss the smaller bits that could cause a more chronic problem for all species of cetacean \u2013 not just those who suction feed.\"","It is very important thing to note that the young whales did not die due to the plastic in their stomachs. In fact, according to National Geographic, the whales had died due to heart failure. This was a consequence of them mistakenly swimming into the North Sea, most likely in search of squid, but then not being able to support the weight of their own body's in such shallow water. As an unfortunate result, the whales internal organs had collapsed.","Even that being the truth, humanity still needs to address this situation as a major warning sign about how much pollution we are pouring into our oceans.

{"postId":"538242957392875520","postText":["New data reveals who's likely to get married more than once"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be dismal, but remarriage is on the rise. According to new findings from the Pew Research center, 40 percent of marriages involve one spouse who's been married before. In 20 percent of new marriages, both spouses have previously said \"I do.\"","\"There's so much dialogue right now about the retreat from marriage in general,\" Gretchen Livingston, Senior Researcher at Pew and author of the study, told The Huffington Post. \"I was really curious to juxtapose that with what's going on with remarriage.\"","Livingston analyzed data from the 2013 American Community Survey as well as the 1960 and 1980 censuses and found that the number of remarried adults in the US has hit 42 million, which is almost double the amount recorded in 1980 and triple the amount in 1960. But not everyone is jumping to remarry -- after combining the hard data on remarriage patterns with the results of a recent Pew survey about marriage, Livingston found that specific demographics are actually less likely to remarry than others.","Among those who are divorced or widowed, age made a big difference in desire to remarry.","There are two demographic shifts that can account for this general surge in remarriage, according to Livingston. For one, the divorce rate is higher now than it was in 1960, so the number of people who are, as she put it, \"eligible\" to remarry has also risen. (But it's worth noting that the divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has been slowly declining and leveling off ever since.)","The more influential factor in the high remarriage rate, however, is a longer life expectancy for partners, particularly among baby boomers. While only 34 percent of those who were 65 and older (and eligible to remarry) had remarried in 1960, 50 percent of that same demographic had remarried in 2013.","\"The older you are, the more likely you are to have ever remarried, because you have more time in your life to have married once, gotten divorced or widowed and found someone else and remarried,\" Livingston said.","Younger Americans went the opposite direction: 75 percent of people ages 25 to 34 and eligible to remarry were remarried in 1960, while only 43 percent of that same demographic were remarried in 2013. It's very possible that this younger group of contemporary divorcees and widows hasn't soured on the institution of marriage completely, however. Livingston pointed out that, since younger demographics have tended to delay marriage -- the average age of first marriage is now is about 27 for women and 29 for men, as opposed to 21 for women and 24 for men in 1960 -- perhaps this group is content to cohabit with partners or advance the relationship in other ways, rather than jump into marriage number two.","Overall, women were less likely than men to want to walk down the aisle again.","Age wasn't the only differentiating factor, though. When Pew polled participants for the aforementioned survey on marriage, they asked single men and women who had been married before if they would be willing to marry again. There was a clear gender divide: Divorced or widowed men were more likely to want to remarry than women in the same position.","A majority of once-married, eligible men -- 65 percent -- either expressed a desire to remarry or were still considering it. In comparison, 43 percent of women said they'd be willing to remarry and 54 percent specifically didn't want to ever marry again. Only 30 percent of men were completely against the idea of a second walk down the aisle.","Previous studies have suggested that men enjoy more health benefits, relationship satisfaction and economic perks from marriage than women do. Livingston said it's quite possible that widowed or divorced men have more motivation to jump back into a new marriage and regain those aforementioned comforts.","Another interesting finding combined both age and gender: In remarriages, 16 percent of couples involve a husband who is at least 10 years older than his wife. This age gap falls to a mere 4 percent in first-time married couples.

In fact, according to Pew, previously married people these days are just as willing to remarry as they were back in 1960. Taken together, these findings can add more detail to an ever-shifting image of the American family.","\"Maybe newlyweds don't look quite as fresh-faced as they did in the late '60s,\" Livingston said, noting once again that 40 percent of today's newlywed couples involve at least one person who's been married before. \"But I think it's very striking and just another example of how the definitions of family and the norm are changing.\""],"targetTitle":"Pew Report Reveals Who's Likely To Get Married More Than Once","targetDescription":"Good news for romantics: The divorce rate may be disma...","targetKeywords":"starter marriage,starter marriages,second marriage,second marriages,second marriage statistics,marriage statistics,starter marriage statistics","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/2322978\/images\/n-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/2322978\/images\/o-ELIZABETH-TAYLOR-HILTON-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/229666\/slide_229666_1039035_free.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/files\/2014\/11\/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-07.png","http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/files\/2014\/11\/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-04.png","http:\/\/www.pewsocialtrends.org\/files\/2014\/11\/ST_2014-11-14_remarriage-02.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1rqzkUw","id":56}

Flu season is here, and enterovirus D68 has spread to all but three states in the continental U.S.","Handwashing can protect against both, says the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We should be doing more of it throughout the day, but it's our bathroom handwashing habits that have been carefully studied -- and they are disgusting.","The simple step is something many consider unnecessary in communal spaces, from your office restroom to bar bathrooms. Some people go so far as to turn on the sink and let the water run, so it only sounds like they're washing their hands.","When researchers hid in a public restroom in a Michigan college town, they reported that 10 percent of people didn't wash their hands after using the bathroom, and nearly one in four just rinsed with water. The average handwashing time? Six seconds, far short of the CDC's recommendation for a 20-second scrub. Men were more than twice as likely as women to leave without washing up.","\"Men are less concerned about things,\" study author Carl P. Borchgrevink, an associate professor at Michigan State University, tells The Huffington Post. \"They're not as thoughtful and they don't like to be told what to do.\" Men also seemed to think they were clean if they were dealing only with their genitalia. \"Many men suggested that unless they had a bowel movement, there would be no need for washing their hands,\" Borchgrevink says.","Michael Sykes, founder of the humor site the International Center for Bathroom Etiquette, says that the act of peeing is so easy for men that it may not register as a way of spreading germs.","\"Men don't have to do much more than unzip their pants to take a pee, and they might simply feel like going to the bathroom is so insignificant as to not even merit a hand washing,\" he writes to HuffPost in an email.","Seventy percent of people confessed to sometimes rinsing without soap, and 81 percent said they had witnessed a \"non-washing event\" in a public restroom within the past year, according to a 2013 survey by Bradley Corporation, which happens to be a manufacturer of bathroom products. Again, men were the grossest offenders: Only 60 percent said they always washed their hands after using a public bathroom, compared to 74 percent of women.

{"postId":"4xzzof","postText":["Is Clinton headed for a landslide win? Here\u2019s one reason it could happen"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["THE MORNING PLUM:","The other day, New York Times polling analyst Nate Cohn laid down a useful marker for gauging whether the conditions are taking shape for Hillary Clinton to crush Donald Trump in a landslide. Cohn noted that the GOP nominee is viewed as fundamentally unfit for the job by an unusually large percentage of Republican voters, perhaps creating unique complications in the quest to unify them.","\"Many Republican voters have an unfavorable impression of him \u2014 worse still, many don\u2019t even think he has the knowledge, temperament or qualifications to be president,\" Cohn wrote. \"If Mr. Trump can\u2019t reunify Republican-leaning voters, Mrs. Clinton really could win in a landslide.\"","Speaking in Warren, Mich., on Aug. 11, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton outlined her vision for the U.S. economy. (The Washington Post)","Today brings new polling that suggests these conditions may indeed may taking shape.","The new NBC News\/Survey Monkey Tracking Poll finds Clinton leading Trump among registered voters nationally by 50-41. Even more crucially, Clinton is demolishing Trump on the question of who has the right personality and temperament to be president: 42 percent of voters say Clinton does, versus only 17 percent who say Trump does.","But note Trump\u2019s numbers among Republicans on the temperament question:","Fewer than one in five Republicans believe Trump has the right personality and temperament to serve as president. (By contrast, 39 percent of Democrats say that about Clinton.) Now, this is only one poll, and the temperament numbers for both candidates were perhaps driven downward by the question wording, which did not poll each individual trait in a separate question, instead asking respondents to pick all the traits that apply.","But this general finding shows up in other polls, too. A recent Washington Post\/ABC News survey found that a surprisingly high 23 percent of Republicans agreed that Trump is \"not qualified to serve as president,\" while 74 percent said he is qualified. Among all adults, 61 percent said Trump is not qualified. Meanwhile, the Post\/ABC poll also found that a staggering 34 percent of Republicans say Trump does not have the right kind of personality and temperament to serve effectively as president, while 67 percent of overall Americans said the same. For Clinton, the percentages of Democrats who said she was unfit for the job by both those metrics was in single digits, while large majorities of overall adults gave her the thumbs-up on them.","This basic imbalance is one of the under-appreciated narratives of this race. It regularly gets lost amid claims that both candidates are historically disliked. While this is true, the underlying and arguably more important story is that in spite of this, only one of the two candidates is widely seen as fundamentally prepared and qualified for the presidency, while the other is widely seen as unprepared and lacking in the basic qualities required for it. And this core imbalance goes deeper: Only one of them is seen as unfit by surprisingly large percentages of voters from his or her own party.","To be clear, Trump could obviously still win this race or make it very close, if he succeeds in uniting Republican voters in the home stretch. It seems very likely to tighten. External events or new Clinton revelations could still shake things up. But the conventions are over, and the Clinton team \u2014 operating with a candidate with very real weaknesses of her own \u2014 appears to be well on its way towards accomplishing its goal of making this election all about Trump\u2019s increasingly obvious temperamental unfitness and lack of qualifications for the job. With a healthy assist from Trump himself, of course.","1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign comes to an end View Photos Hillary Clinton loses to Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

Melina Mara\/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.","*****************************************************************************","* CLINTON HOLDS WIDE LEAD IN VIRGINIA: A new Washington Post poll finds that Clinton leads Trump in Virginia by 52-38 among registered voters and by 51-43 among likely voters. Note: The poll also finds that Trump is viewed unfavorably by 70 percent of women and 70 percent of white college graduates.","This once again suggests that Trump\u2019s failure to broaden his appeal is putting him at a major disadvantage in states that are supposed to be very close (as Virginia was in 2012).","* QUOTE OF THE DAY, EVERYONE-HATES-TRUMP EDITION: The Post write-up of the new Virginia poll includes this gem from a Republican-leaning voter in the state:","Walt Purnell, 71, a retired business executive from Ashburn, had hoped to vote for Jeb Bush \u2014 or John Kasich. Or Marco Rubio. Or Chris Christie. But Trump? No way. \"I think he\u2019s a failure, I think he\u2019s a fraud, I think he\u2019s a con artist, I think he\u2019s insane,\" Purnell said.","Have we mentioned that this election is becoming a referendum on Trump\u2019s fundamental unfitness for the job?","* CLINTON OWNS THE AIRWAVES: Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and the First Read crew serve up these striking numbers:","Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign...has spent $61 million over the airwaves, while pro-Clinton outside groups have chipped in an additional $43 million. That\u2019s a combined $104 million in total ad spending for Team Clinton. But in that same time frame, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign still hasn\u2019t spent a single cent on a general-election ad, with two pro-Trump outside groups coming to the rescue with $12.4 million over the airwaves. That\u2019s a nearly 9-to-1 advantage in ad spending.","It\u2019s another fundamental Trumpian disadvantage that could grow more pronounced in the home stretch.","* TRUMP WOULD PROBABLY SEND TROOPS TO MIDEAST: The New York Times makes a good point about Trump\u2019s big foreign policy speech yesterday:","Though Mr. Trump made no reference to whether he would send more American troops back to the region, that appeared to be the clear implication. The kind of relentless attacks on the Islamic State he advocates \u2014 along with taking and holding the oil fields, which may well be a violation of international law \u2014 would require a considerable presence by American troops or their allies, and foreign bases to launch the drones.","Trump\u2019s promise is basically to promise to crush the terrorist enemy while vowing no messy entanglements abroad. It\u2019s a scam.","* TRUMP\u2019S POLICY GIBBERISH: Trump is now proposing to impose a new ideological test on those trying to enter the country from areas scarred by terrorism. CNN analyst Peter Bergen explains why the idea is half baked at best:","This seems unworkable. For example, would anyone sitting for these tests volunteer that they had secret proclivities for jihadist terrorism? Also, Trump didn\u2019t specify what countries would be affected by this new test. But France has a serious domestic terrorism problem \u2014 would French citizens be subjected to this kind of test?...In short, Trump didn\u2019t say who would be targeted for these ideological tests, saying only that he would consult the State Department about how to approach this issue.","The idea is really an effort to repackage Trump\u2019s Muslim ban as somehow being in sync with American values.","* TRUMP\u2019S BIG LIE ABOUT ISIS: Trump continues to claim (as he did in his speech yesterday) that Obama policies were the chief cause of ISIS. Glenn Kessler corrects the record:","This is false and facile. The terror group is the direct result of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003....At best, one could argue that actions that Obama failed to take (over Clinton\u2019s opposition) helped contribute to the growth of ISIS.","What\u2019s always missing from Trump\u2019s account is that Clinton was more hawkish than Obama was. Meanwhile, Kessler\u2019s interview with author Joby Warrick explores all this in more detail.","* TRUMP MAY COST GOP A GENERATION OF VOTERS: Trump is getting slaughtered among younger voters. Michael Gerson reflects on the reasons for this and its potential consequences:","Younger voters are less likely than other age groups to regard racially inclusive language as \"politically correct.\" They are less likely to believe in \"reverse discrimination\" and to embrace anti-immigrant attitudes....Young people understand the logo of the Republican nominee...as conveying a message of exclusion. These are the first serious political impressions of my younger son, voting in his first presidential election this year. It is the way to lose a generation.","Never Trump conservatives and Democrats both agree that the GOP\u2019s nomination of Trump provides a unique opportunity to tarnish the GOP among a whole new generation.","* CLINTON PREPARES FOR SLIME-FEST DEBATE: Politico\u2019s Annie Karni reports that the Clinton team is preparing for the absolute worst at the debates with Trump:","The person picked to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s sparring partner in her upcoming debate prep sessions is expected to confront her about the death of Vincent Foster, label her as a rapist\u2019s enabler, and invoke the personally painful memories of Monica Lewinsky and Gennifer Flowers....one of the key components of that prep...is finding a person who can stand in as Donald Trump during mock debates and launch personal attacks...that will make the real Trump look tame by comparison.","Cue up a fresh round of commentary claiming that Trump\u2019s \"street fighting\" debate style should make Democrats very, very afraid \u2014 even though thus far it has been a buffoonish failure."],"targetTitle":"Is Clinton headed for a landslide win?

As it turns out, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump share something pertinent in common, after all \u2014 a tax haven cozily nested inside the United States.","\"famous for helping tens of thousands of companies avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in tax.\" This brick-and-mortar, nondescript two-story building in Wilmington, Delaware would be awfully crowded if its registered occupants \u2014 285,000 companies \u2014 actually resided there. What\u2019s come to be known as the \"Delaware loophole\" \u2014 the unassuming building at 1209 North Orange Street \u2014 has become, as the Guardian described","Reportedly dozens of Fortune 500 companies \u2014 Coca-Cola, Walmart, American Airlines, and Apple, to name a few \u2014 use Delaware\u2019s strict corporate secrecy laws and legal tax loopholes by registering the North Orange Street address for official business.","\"Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse \u2014 all have turned up at the Delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes, skirting regulations, plying friendly courts or, when needed, covering their tracks,\" the New York Times\u2019 Leslie Wayne \"It\u2019s easy to set up shell companies here, no questions asked.\" the\u2019 Leslie Wayne described in 2012.","Do As I Say, Not As I Do. And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\" While the legitimacy of taxes as a concept may be up to personal interpretation, what matters in Clinton\u2019s use of the so-called Delaware loophole, in particular, is her constant harping on the need for corporations and elite individuals to pay their fair share. In other words, Clinton\u2019s employment of North Orange Street amounts to a telling,. And, as the Guardian notes, both of \"the leading candidates for president \u2013 Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump \u2013 have companies registered at 1209 North Orange, and have refused to explain why.\"","As Rupert Neate explained for the Guardian, being registered in the tiny state allows \"companies to legally shift earnings from other states to Delaware, where they are not taxed on non-physical incomes generated outside of state.\"","In fact, some have claimed \u2014 all revelations of Panamanian documents aside \u2014 the use of tax-friendly locations inside the U.S. makes it the biggest tax haven in the world, with Delaware, alone, costing other states some $9 billion in lost taxes over the past decade. Clinton has repeatedly touted the needs for tax transparency and to shut down foreign havens with similar loopholes.","\"Some of you may have just heard about these disclosures about outrageous tax havens and loopholes and superrich people across the world are exploiting in Panama and elsewhere,\" Clinton \"We are going after all these scams and make sure everyone pays their fair share here in America.\" Clinton told the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO annual Constitutional Convention earlier this month.","Oh, the irony.","According to Neate, a Clinton spokesman explained, \"ZFS [Holdings, LLC] was set up when Secretary Clinton left the State Department as an entity to manage her book and speaking income. No federal, state, or local taxes were saved by the Clintons as a result of this structure.\"","Why, if what the spokesman claims to be true, would Clinton bother using an address in Delaware?","Of the 515 companies Trump officially registered with the Federal Election Commission, \"We have 378 entities registered in the state of Delaware,\" the billionaire told the Guardian, \"meaning I pay you a lot of money, folks. I don\u2019t feel guilty at all, OK?\"","\"a magnet ... which individuals and corporations can use to evade an inestimable amount in federal and foreign taxes,\" as a Delaware\u2019s incredibly business-friendly structure that allows for such a crowded address is completely legal, though the ability to create shell corporations lends to shady dealings and isas a report by the Institute on Taxation and Foreign Policy has described.","Still, Clinton\u2019s constant moralizing on tax transparency \u2014 and her spokesperson\u2019s claims she hasn\u2019t benefited from the North Orange Street address \u2014 proves, yet again, her stances offer little in the way of a solid foundation."],"targetTitle":"Trump and Hillary Refuse to Explain Why They Both Share the Same Address in Delaware","targetDescription":"\"Big corporations, small-time businesses, rogues, scoundrels, and worse \u2014 all have turned up at the Delaware address in hopes of minimizing taxes.\"","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH\/3c07c95d4d838fa5464865a4dbe1ad07ee9641bb","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH\/6d46707b66125acb65785a9afcbc34a2e52e60c7.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH\/d227c42c2855f34bf7537ae48dfd8e1e83489593","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAJH\/AP\/\/\/wAAAMDAwAAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAABAAEAQAICVAEAOwA=","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH\/4e98ff003dac933dc0c5c1934680ebc7590f6706\/scr.png","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH\/dadd23eba6d040a228baf13b5c981651da1d7c40.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/vsUeH","id":66}

HBO signed a deal with Amazon to make its archive of television programs available for streaming for Prime customers.

The approximately 2,400-square-foot condominium, in a decidedly deluxe if architecturally nondescript full-service building and owned per property records by an investment banker who bought it in March 2005 for $2.45 million from retired Italian racecar driver Mauricio Flammini, has an open-plan layout that includes an unusually spacious and arguably space-wasting foyer with stone tile floor materials, smooth paneled walls and half a dozen small closets and storage cabinets. The main living space stretches a generous 35 feet and combines the kitchen, dining and lounge areas. There\u2019s a wood-burning fireplace sheathed in hand set slate tiles, and the smallish but sleek kitchen accommodates a full-range of snazzy high-quality appliances, including an integrated espresso machine. An open-tread switchback staircase ascends to a jail cell-sized lounge that opens to a 200-plus-square-foot private terrace with outdoor shower space and panoramic city views from the Empire State Building to north and the new World Trade Center in the south.","Officially, the penthouse has three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and online marketing materials show one of the guest\/family bedrooms has a custom-built Murphy bed and the other \u2014 labeled as a \"bedroom\/library\" on the floor plan \u2014 has corner windows and floor-to-ceiling built-ins with low enclosed storage and open shelving. The master suite, set privately away from the other bedrooms and lined on at least two walls with stunning, matchbook pattern wood paneling, includes a dressing hall lined with wardrobes, a laundry closet with full-sized machines and a windowless bathroom with poured concrete two-sink vanity, ebony tiled walls, a heated towel rack and a glass-enclosed multi-head shower.","This is not the first high-priced New York City rental for the former \"Dawson\u2019s Creek\" star who produced and co-starred in the recently released silver screen drama \"Mania Days\" and who will portray Jacqueline Kennedy in an upcoming TV miniseries (\"The Kennedys After Camelot\"). In or around August 2012 she moved out of the $30 million-plus Beverly Hills mansion she shared with her now ex-husband Tom Cruise and holed up with their preternaturally fashion forward toddler, Suri, in a $12,500 per month rental at the so-called Chelsea Mercantile, which afforded her a convenient back door entrance into the Whole Foods located on the building\u2019s ground floor as well as direct access to a subterranean parking garage that allowed her to evade paparazzi and the Scientology flacks who were widely reported at the time to surveil her.","Last summer the slim and stylish single mother, who may or may not be romantically involved with Jamie Foxx, returned to Los Angeles, where she shelled out $3.375 million for a nearly 6,000-square-foot six bedroom and 6.5 bathroom residence \u2014 listing details described it as a \"Grand European Manor\" \u2014 in a guard-gated and celeb-favored development in Calabasas. Some of the other high-profile homeowners in the affluent suburban enclave include Michael Jackson\u2019s mother and his three children; 1980s hair band star-turned-reality television regular Bret Michaels, whose house is currently for sale at $3.469 million; Khloe Kardashian, who bought her place last spring for $7.2 million from Justin Beiber; Kourtney Kardashian, who just this last weekend dumped her famously douchey boyfriend and baby daddy Scott Disick; and the Kardashian sisters\u2019 17-year-old half-sister Kylie Jenner, who just a few months ago paid $2.6 million for an architecturally pastiched residence of almost 5,000-square-feet and who, apropos of nothing, really, has admitted to having her teen-aged lips augmented with fillers and dates a 25-year old rapper and rent skipper named Tyga.","Listing photos and floor plan: Town Residential"],"targetTitle":"Katie Holmes Rents New York City Penthouse","targetDescription":"Katie Holmes signs lease for $25,000 per month penthouse in New York City's Chelsea nabe","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/logan-movie-5.jpg?w=148&h=90&crop=1","http:\/\/heartbeat.pmc.com\/track?host=variety.com&path=%2F2015%2Fdirt%2Freal-estalker%2Fkatie-holmes-rents-new-york-city-penthouse-1201534554%2F&post_id=1201534554&title=Katie+Holmes+Rents+New+York+City+Penthouse&author=Mark+David&comment_count=3","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/james-mangold-playback-podcast.jpg?w=89&h=89&crop=1","http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/ad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536?s=25","http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/24bef84a44fc1da74ade055d2ddb24fa?s=32&d=http%3A%2F%2F2.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&r=PG","http:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/katieholmes_nyc_lse21.jpg?w=146&h=82&crop=1","http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/7adfc6953daa97e3cc5276a00caf1ffe?s=32&d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&r=PG","http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/www.indiewire.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/shutterstock_5140784m.jpg?resize=180%2C101","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/katieholmes_nyc_lse12.jpg?w=146&h=82&crop=1","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/pmc-variety-2014\/library\/images\/modules\/vscore\/ajax-loader.gif","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/beauty-and-the-beast-3.jpg?w=148&h=90&crop=1","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/katie-holmes-nyc-penthouse.jpg?w=640&h=427&crop=1","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel?a.1=code&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/katie-holmes-nyc-penthouse.jpg?w=640&h=377&crop=1","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/trump-arnold.png?w=148&h=90&crop=1","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/pmc-variety-2014\/library\/images\/global\/real-estalker-logo.png","http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/aquazzura-paris-fashion-week-photo_xavier_granet-5469.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1","http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/pmcspy.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/lomo.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/mahershala2.jpg?w=89&h=89&crop=1","https:\/\/s0.wp.com\/wp-content\/themes\/vip\/pmc-variety-2014\/library\/images\/global\/site-logo_2x_v1.png","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/12\/batb-20582csm.jpg?resize=180%2C101","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/02\/deadpool-6.jpg?w=148&h=90&crop=1","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/rise.jpg?w=148&h=90&crop=1","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/oscars-best-picture-moonlight.jpg?w=89&h=89&crop=1","http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/the-arrangement-preview.jpg?resize=180%2C101","https:\/\/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/damien-chazelle-barry-jenkins-variety-oscar-cover-story-2.jpg?w=89&h=89&crop=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/variety.com\/2015\/dirt\/real-estalker\/katie-holmes-rents-new-york-city-penthouse-1201534554\/","id":69}
{"postId":"54esjq","postText":["Apple iPhone 7 has two nasty surprises"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Questions over supply remain and there is no doubt \u2019s new iPhones are already proving immensely popular. But two nasty surprises have been discovered which may cause owners of the iPhone 7 to regret their purchase...","\u2018Great Features\u2019 and \u2018Nasty Surprises\u2019 are my regular columns investigating the latest software and hardware for the best features \/ biggest problems hidden behind the headlines.","Nasty Surprise #1: Goodbye Sapphire?","The first concern comes courtesy of popular YouTube channel JerryRigEverything. The famously diligent test site ran the iPhone 7 through the durability tests and claims Apple has ditched its premium sapphire glass from both the new home button and the camera lens:","The revelation comes after JerryRigEverything used hardness picks to determine the makeup of both surfaces on the Mohs\u2019 scale of mineral hardness. Previously his tests on the iPhone 6S confirmed the presence of sapphire, but this time both the new home button and larger camera of the iPhone 7 scratched easily using picks that do not damage sapphire.","He concludes: \"we know for sure that it is regular glass and not sapphire.\"","And here\u2019s where it gets interesting, because Apple still advertises that both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus as using sapphire (which is considerably more expensive than toughened glass) on the home button and camera lens. Given the new iPhones are marketed as more durable than ever this would be a major let down. I have put these claims to Apple and will update when\/if the company responds.","Note: As JerryRigEverything has not tested the iPhone 7 Plus we cannot make assumptions here. Being the more expensive model, it\u2019s possible sapphire is still used there.","Nasty Surprise #2: New Home Button, New Limitations","The controversies around the new home button continue as well following a discovery by Myke Hurley, eagle eyed founder of RelayFM, who spotted the button only responds to capacitive touch not pressure.","This means the button will not react should you be wearing standard gloves since there is no response anymore to physical movement. As he points out, if you want to test this for yourself then put some material (such as your shirt\/t-shirt) over the button and try pressing.","That\u2019s right, you get nothing. Hardly ideal when winter and you need to wear gloves.","There are a couple of ways around this. Firstly you can invest in \u2018touchscreen gloves\u2019 which use conductive thread to transfer the mild electrical charge in your skin to which capacitive touchscreens respond (note that\u2019s a bogus claim that these don\u2019t work, but I\u2019ve tried two pairs and they do).","Secondly you can setup AssistiveTouch, though that's primarily used for when an old physical home button is broken outside warranty. Feel free to insert your joke of choice here.","Designed By Apple - For Apple?","All of which leaves me in two minds about the iPhone 7\u2019s biggest external changes and who they really help the most.","For example, the new home button kills a weak spot in iPhone design for Apple as the old physical button was notorious for going wrong - it saves on warranty claims. But the taptic engine required to simulate physical movement uses all the space vacated by the headphone jack (as the photo from iFixit illustrates below).","I\u2019m not convinced many users would consider this the best way to utilise the additional space the headphone jack used. Personally a far bigger battery would\u2019ve been top of my list.","Then there are little cost cutting omissions. If sapphire has indeed been dropped from the iPhone 7 then that is a notable one (sapphire is 5-10x more expensive than toughened glass). Meanwhile there are little packaging shortcuts such as the removal of the earphone case. Instead earphones with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are just wrapped around a piece of card.","This despite the fact iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus prices were increased compared to the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus in every country.","Yes there are good surprises in the new iPhones as well (most notably in the iPhone 7 Plus) but if you didn\u2019t buy an iPhone 7 just yet, waiting a little longer for some answers is probably a good idea...","___","More On Forbes","Apple iOS 10 Has 25 Great Secret Features","Apple iOS 10.0.1: Should You Upgrade?","Apple iPhone 7 Plus Has A Great Secret Feature","iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 7 Plus: What's The Difference?","iPhone 7 Vs iPhone 6S: What's The Difference?"],"targetTitle":"Apple iPhone 7 Has Two Nasty Surprises","targetDescription":"Apple's iPhone 7 has problems which may make customers regret upgrading...","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=960","http:\/\/specials-images.forbesimg.com\/imageserve\/599933512\/400x400.jpg?fit=scale&background=000000","https:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-18-at-01.51.18-1200x765.jpg?width=640&height=434","http:\/\/1.gravatar.com\/avatar\/135313297429b8a66b069508000b1134?s=400&d=mm&r=g","http:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-22.30.46.jpg?width=960","http:\/\/blogs-images.forbes.com\/gordonkelly\/files\/2016\/09\/Screenshot-2016-09-17-at-21.08.17-1200x658.jpg?width=960"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/gordonkelly\/2016\/09\/17\/apple-iphone-7-home-button-problems\/#6edff832541d","id":70}
{"postId":"562692085917425664","postText":["A University Recognizes a Third Gender: Neutral"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Being a boy didn\u2019t feel right, either: \"I had a couple months where I gave it a go. I tried to bind my chest with an Ace bandage every day. I wore some masculine clothes and told my friends to call me Emmett.\"","Neither category applied. \"It felt not only like I was invisible but, especially at that time when hormones are aflutter, like no one would really know what I was like for the rest of my life.\"","Gieselman began spending time at Outright Vermont, a trans and queer youth center where the gender lexicon of activists and academe is widely accepted. \"As soon as I learned about a genderqueer identity, I was like, \u2018Oh! That\u2019s the one!\u2019\" said Gieselman, who frequently ends sentences with a gentle laugh. \"Before, it had been really difficult to explain how I was feeling to other people, and even really difficult to explain it in my own head. Suddenly, there was a language for it, and that started the journey.\"","Gieselman dumped the girlie name bestowed at birth, asked friends and teachers to use Rocko, the tough-sounding nickname friends had come up with, and told people to use \"they\" instead of \"he\" or \"she.\" \"They\" has become an increasingly popular substitute for \"he\" or \"she\" in the transgender community, and the University of Vermont, a public institution of some 12,700 students, has agreed to use it.","While colleges across the country have been grappling with concerns related to students transitioning from one gender to another, Vermont is at the forefront in recognizing the next step in identity politics: the validation of a third gender.","The university allows students like Gieselman to select their own identity \u2014 a new first name, regardless of whether they\u2019ve legally changed it, as well as a chosen pronoun \u2014 and records these details in the campuswide information system so that professors have the correct terminology at their fingertips.","For years, writers and academics have argued that gender identity is not a male\/female binary but a continuum along which any individual may fall, depending on a variety of factors, including anatomy, chromosomes, hormones and feelings. But the dichotomy is so deeply embedded in our culture that even the most radical activists had been focused mainly on expanding the definitions of the two pre-existing categories.","Today, a growing number of students are embracing the idea that when it comes to classifying gender, there should be more than two options \u2014 something now afforded by the dating website OkCupid and by Facebook, which last year added a tab for \"custom\" alongside \"male\" and \"female,\" with some 50 options, including \"agender,\" \"androgyne,\" \"pangender\" and \"trans person,\" as well as an option for controlling who can see the customized version.","Activists on campuses as diverse as Penn State, University at Albany, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, and University of California, Riverside, are laying claim to a degree of identity freedom nearly unimaginable when the first L.G.B.T student centers were established. Today\u2019s students, who grew up with Gay-Straight Alliances in their high schools, with transgender people represented in the media and with transgender rights percolating through the courts, arrived on campuses already L.G.B.T.-friendly and, in many cases, equipped with gender-neutral housing and bathrooms.","In hopes of raising consciousness of the biases built into social structures and into the language we use to discuss them, students are organizing identity conferences and inventing new vocabularies, which include pronouns like \"ze\" and \"xe,\" and pressing administrations to make changes that validate, in language, the existence of a gender outside the binary.","Certainly, there\u2019s a long line of people throughout history whose traits have put them outside norms, and some cultures long ago formalized the existence of a gender that isn\u2019t purely female or purely male, like the American Indian\u2019s two-spirits or India\u2019s hijras. But the binary is a belief system at least as old as Adam and Eve, and most people don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s there. \"It\u2019s like a constant coming-out process, educating those around you that there is a gender binary, and this is what it means to identify outside of it,\" said Gieselman, who works on campus planning gender-related events.","Identifying as genderqueer is an opportunity to self-invent, unburdened from social expectations about dress and behavior. Occasionally Gieselman wishes for a lower voice and flatter chest, but other times feels O.K. with, even happy about, having a feminine physique.","\"Even within the same day or the next day I can suddenly really love how my chest looks in a sundress,\" said Gieselman, who wears two small nose rings. In the bedroom closet hang T-shirts, flannels, dresses and a rack of bow ties.","It might seem a simple turn of events, but adding gender-neutral options to the University of Vermont\u2019s information system took nearly a decade of lobbying, the creation of a task force of students, faculty members and administrators, and six months and $80,000 in staff time to create a software patch.","One key to the developments is Dorothea Brauer, a plain-spoken, big-hearted mental health counselor known to everyone as Dot. Ms. Brauer spent nine years working at the campus counseling center before becoming, in 2001, the director of what was then called the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning & Ally Center.","While in her 20s and living in New Jersey, Ms. Brauer, who wears her hair cut short with a single, long braid down her back in tribute to a Cherokee grandmother, was spending time with a woman when an acquaintance changed the course of her life by inquiring about the relationship, and then pointedly but nonjudgmentally asking, \"Honey, are you gay?\"","\"I said, \u2018Well, yeah, but only with Anita,\u2019 \" recalled Ms. Brauer. (Anita would turn out to be her life partner \u2014 32 years and counting.) \"That\u2019s how clueless I was,\" she said, chuckling over a taco salad lunch at the Penny Cluse Cafe\u0301 in downtown Burlington. \"I was 24, 25, and scared to death. I came out to my mother, only my mother, because I became physically ill with depression.\"","A decade later, as one of the few out women on campus in the 1990s, she treated students with debilitating identity issues, some of whom attempted suicide or faced a psychotic break. (L.G.B.T.Q. youth are more than twice as likely to attempt suicide as their heterosexual peers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.) Ms. Brauer\u2019s first act upon being installed as the center\u2019s director was to assign a graduate student to research and catalog the unmet needs of the transgender community.","Among the difficulties faced by transgender students: inability to use bathrooms marked \"men\" or \"women\" for fear of a confrontation with a confused classmate; being accused of using a stolen student ID in the cafeteria because the name printed on it didn\u2019t match someone\u2019s gender appearance; and having the faculty rely on a student-information system that listed only legal names, leading to occasions when a student might be embarrassed or inadvertently outed. Ms. Brauer heard about one distraught transgender freshman whose professor, while calling roll, first read the student\u2019s feminine legal name, then announced the male nickname.","Ms. Brauer reached out to the registrar, Keith P. Williams, who worked with the university\u2019s lawyers to allow transgender students to change their first name in the schoolwide system, but doing so required an in-person visit to the dean of students\u2019 office and filling out paperwork. She then set to work waging a campaign to educate, face to face, members of the faculty, staff and administration on why language sensitivity was so important to a student\u2019s self-respect \u2014 and assisted students in getting school policy amended to specifically prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.","By 2009, faculty members themselves began pushing for a broader solution to the identification issue, and Mr. Williams created a task force to look into how students could register a preferred first name without having to make a special request. The task force realized that the only way to guarantee a professor would properly refer to a student was to supply the student\u2019s pronoun on class rosters and advisee lists. Then came the question of which gender-neutral pronoun to offer.","\"Students proposed \u2018they\/them\u2019 pronouns, but the faculty vetoed the idea because they said it is grammatically incorrect,\" Mr. Williams recalled. \"They said, \u2018You don\u2019t put a plural pronoun with a single individual.\u2019\" A second option, also being used in various trans communities, was \"ze\" (pronounced ZEE), a riff on the German pronoun \"sie,\" with \"hir\" replacing \"his\/her.\"","Bowing to the faculty, the task force selected \"ze\" and revised its information system, becoming the first school in the nation at which students could select their pronoun. They could also leave the field blank, or opt for \"name only,\" indicating a preference for being referred to by name instead of by pronoun.","The change fueled gender-awareness campaigns by students all over the country. So many administrators were receiving requests that, in 2012, the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers convened a task force to draft a list of best practices for handling transgender student records.","So far, about 100 schools now allow students, and sometimes employees, to indicate a moniker other than their legal first name, according to the Consortium of Higher Education L.G.B.T Resource Professionals, and hundreds more have contacted Vermont on how to implement the pronoun choice.","In September, the university\u2019s pronoun options were expanded yet again to include \"they,\" as grammarians have reminded naysayers that the English language is constantly evolving. Since 2009, 1,891 University of Vermont students have specified a preferred pronoun, with 14 opting for \"ze,\" 10 for \"they\" and another 228 for name only.","On campuses across the country gender-conscious students have adopted the earnest, P.C. practice of starting social interactions by introducing themselves by name and \"P.G.P.,\" or preferred gender pronoun. (The most semantically obsessed still object to the word \"preferred.\")","Robyn Ochs, an educator who helped found an early L.G.B.T. faculty and staff group at Harvard, believes that Vermont\u2019s changes are nothing less than lifesaving.","\"Some people try to reduce this whole topic to kids trying to be cool or they\u2019re just acting out or whatever, just trying to be different or new,\" said Ms. Ochs, who has visited some 500 campuses to speak on L.G.B.T. issues, and often facilitates a discussion she calls \"Beyond Binaries.\" \"But there have always been people who have felt profoundly uncomfortable in their assigned gender roles,\" she said. \"Anything we can do to make them safer, or make them feel recognized, heard, seen, understood, we should do. To validate their identity and experience could, in fact, save their life.\"","How does one explain to family members what it means to be neither male nor female? Once, at age 15, in conversation with an aunt at the kitchen table, Gieselman tried unsuccessfully to diagram the concepts of gender and sex on a napkin, with gender referring to the attitudes and behaviors a society associates with a person\u2019s biological sex, and sex referring to a person\u2019s biological status (not to be confused with sexual orientation, one\u2019s romantic interests). \"I don\u2019t even know what it was I was trying to show,\" Gieselman, an eighth-generation Vermonter, recounted with a laugh. Gieselman\u2019s grandmother, too, had a few questions about the napkin. \"They were very confused,\" Gieselman said, \"and still are.\"","Sara Miller, Gieselman\u2019s mother, said that when her teenager first came out to her and offered to provide a pronoun chart for reference, she scoffed.","\"At the time, it irritated me to no end,\" said Ms. Miller, a social worker. \"I was like, \u2018Really? This is what our struggle is going to be about? Pronouns?\u2019\"","But Ms. Miller has learned to accept the person her former little girl has become. \"It\u2019s grown out of the process of really seeing how Rocko has grown as an individual and an adult, seeing how Rocko is their own person, and not a child,\" Ms. Miller said. \"This is how they presents themself to new friends and colleagues and employers and students. That group knows Rocko only that way.\"","Although Ms. Miller tries her best to always use \"they\/them\" pronouns, she often slips up, but Gieselman isn\u2019t bothered. \"Rocko and I have an understanding. She knows I try,\" said Ms. Miller, slipping up again.","At last summer\u2019s orientation for new faculty members, Ms. Brauer handed out pocket-size pronoun charts created by the L.G.B.T. Resource Center at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. She also gave out her cellphone number and words of support: \"If you\u2019re struggling with it, give me a call any time and I\u2019ll walk you through it, and give you time to practice, and walk you through any questions you might have.\"","Use of \"they\/them\" is so widely accepted in the politically correct enclave that is Burlington that a colleague at Feldman\u2019s Bagels, where Gieselman works part time, recently asked if it was O.K. to correct a customer who uses the wrong pronoun because she knew Gieselman wouldn\u2019t.","\"I know if something might be bothering them, they wouldn\u2019t necessarily say something about it,\" said Alexa Ciecierski, a morning-shift co-worker.","At the apartment that afternoon, Gieselman talked excitedly about finally receiving documentation of a legal name change, which arrived in the mail that afternoon, and showed off several gig posters brought home by a roommate, who manages local bands. On the coffee table, a collection of Angel Cards filled a small bowl, each billet offering a single word like \"discernment\" or \"balance\" or \"integrity,\" meant to be chosen and read for a daily dose of inspiration.","\"Do you want to pick one?\" Gieselman asked me. I reached in the bowl and pulled out \"strength.\"","Gieselman leaned forward off the futon, swished the cards around, plucked one from the center, smiled, then read it aloud: \"Freedom.\""],"targetTitle":"A University Recognizes a Third Gender: Neutral","targetDescription":"Rocko Gieselman goes by the pronoun \"they.\" Acknowledging the next step in identity politics, the University of Vermont has agreed to use it.","targetKeywords":"Transgender and Transsexuals,Colleges and Universities,English Language,University of Vermont,Vermont","targetMedia":["https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2015\/02\/03\/us\/02GENDER-hp\/02GENDER-hp-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2015\/02\/03\/us\/02GENDER-hp\/02GENDER-hp-master675-v2.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2015\/02\/03\/education\/edl-08glossary-card\/edl-08glossary-card-master675.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2015\/02\/08\/education\/edlife\/0208GENDER1\/0208GENDER1-blog427.jpg","https:\/\/static01.nyt.com\/images\/2015\/02\/08\/education\/edlife\/08MBA\/08MBA-thumbStandard.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/nyti.ms\/1Ap2rAE","id":71}
{"postId":"824032305769545728","postText":["10 pieces of career advice that are as true today as they were in 1996"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["In the summer of 1996 after my sophomore year of college, I started an internship at a nonprofit technology association in downtown Washington, D.C.","Until that point, I\u2019d only worked in retail and had no idea what to expect. I asked my father and a professor for advice. Remarkably, 20 years later much of that guidance still resonates.","Doors open based on who you know","In the late 90s, these were physical doors rather than virtual ones, but the concept is the same. When applying for a job or looking to connect with someone, name-dropping would increase your odds of getting a positive response. Today, although we have exponentially larger networks thanks to social media, deep, in-person relationships still provide the greatest networking benefit. ","As you build your network of contacts, remember to follow up","Meeting a contact once is a wasted opportunity unless you periodically remind him or her of who you are and take steps to grow the relationship over time. In the 90s, I was encouraged to send snail mail holiday cards to former bosses and colleagues, and even to pick up the phone occasionally. Twenty years later, it\u2019s all about LinkedIn.","In a new situation, aim to assimilate","Corporate culture used to be \"one-size-fits-all.\" If you worked in a business office in any city in the world, you were expected to behave professionally, adhere to hierarchies, and generally do what you were told without making waves. Individual company cultures may be more unique today (conservative versus liberal, strict versus playful) but the need to examine and then fit into a new culture \u2013 whatever it may be \u2013 remains.","Dress for the job you want","Like business culture, business dress was once straightforward. Junior level professionals in the 90s could wear business casual, which consisted of khakis and polos for guys and slacks or skirts paired with nice blouses for women. However, by the time you reached a senior level, you were advised to take it up a notch with tailored suits and pricey shoes and accessories. Basing your appearance on that of the executives sent a very clear signal that you intended to climb the ladder quickly. And it still does \u2013 even if the executives in your company now wear jeans and Hollister tee-shirts.","Be humble and willing to learn from any task","In the 90s, if your boss asked you to grab coffee or make copies, you did it with a smile. You understood that you were paid for the privilege of watching and learning as the higher-ups did the real work. Today, those with little experience may feel empowered to say no to grunt work, but that doesn\u2019t mean refusal is a smart idea. Human nature hasn\u2019t changed and humility will get you everywhere. ","Success is not about effort, it\u2019s about visibility and value","Early in my career, I made the mistake of churning out work product that no one ever saw. I didn\u2019t get ahead until I made sure my managers were aware of how my contributions were impacting the bottom line. Today\u2019s emphasis on lean teams and productivity means that adding and communicating value is more important than ever.","A bad attitude will break your reputation","Losing your cool at work has always been frowned upon, and despite claims of a kinder, gentler 21st century workplace, it still is. And now, the stakes are higher because your epic in-office rant won\u2019t just be a legend passed down from employee to employee. Instead, it could be taped on a phone and broadcast on social media for perpetuity. ","Take advantage of company-sponsored training opportunities","The concept that employees should \"skill up\" to remain competitive has been around for several decades, and in the last years of the 20th century, companies had dollars to spend on tuition reimbursement and courses like Dale Carnegie. In 2016, training opportunities are scarcer and more varied (online, in-person, etc.), but they should still be coveted. It\u2019s only a matter of time before individuals will be responsible for 100 percent of their professional development.","If you want to keep a secret, don\u2019t tell anyone","Workplace gossip has been a \"thing\" since biblical times, and in 1996, the chief concern was that if you told a colleague a secret or rumor in confidence, that individual would share it with someone else and it might be heard by the wrong person. Never has this advice been more critical than today, when, thanks to the speed and ease of digital communication, your secret WILL be heard by the wrong person \u2013 guaranteed.","Be respectful of others\u2019 time","Back in the day, we arrived exactly on time for interviews. We asked politely for networking conversations and check-in meetings with our bosses that fit into a half hour slot in the day planner. When we thought people were busy then \u2013 filing paperwork, sending faxes, and leaving voicemails \u2013 we had no idea what we were in for. In 2016, people are so overscheduled and frazzled that they take their iPhones to the bathroom. If you make them wait, they might just lose it.s"],"targetTitle":"Some things never change: 1996 career advice that's still solid","targetDescription":"Things change, but some job advices is timeless","targetKeywords":"cars, work-life, business","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":72}

There was a primary school for the prisoners' children, who they brought to live with them, and in the most notorious twist of all, there was an in-house cocaine factory.","\"I thought what is this place? I even had to pay my own taxi fare to get there,\" Thomas McFadden remembers today.","After his release in 2000, he left those days far behind and is now a chicken farmer in Tanzania. However, his life-changing friendship with his \"brother Rusty\" has gone the distance, and he has even named one of his children after him.","Their unusual relationship began when Mr Young joined one of the illegal prison tours that the inmate ran for foreign backpackers from early 1997 until his release.","Word had spread around local hostels that there was an English-speaking inmate who would show visitors around this strange microcosm.","Centrally located in downtown La Paz, the prison became a tourist attraction that featured in Lonely Planet guidebooks. Travellers paid an entrance fee and, in some cases, opted to stay for weeks, partying with the inmates.","Lydia Docking, a British traveller, went on not just one but repeated trips to the prison in 2008, led by a prisoner from Portugal. One of the other backpackers she met on her first day there later became her husband.","\"As a conversation starter, we used to say we met in a Bolivian jail,\" she says from her new home in Sydney. She was 24 at the time and is 33 now.","Their San Pedro tour guide came to their wedding after his release, and although the couple has since separated, she still has their dog, named Pedro after the prison.","Despite her jokes, she is acutely well aware of the darker side of the story. \"I'm still confused by it, still processing it,\" she says. \"Over the course of three weeks, we went most days. I sometimes question why. It was mostly just to share experiences and to understand how lives start the same but can take such different paths.\"","San Pedro Prison remains operational today, despite many plans to close it. For years, its tours were an open secret, but one day in 2009 a local television crew arrived to get footage for a story about a politician held inside. While waiting in the plaza outside, the cameramen caught a steady stream of tourists going in.","Armed with the footage, the Bolivian press ran with the story. The main concern locally was not the tourists but the alleged corruption of the authorities, who were thought to be taking a cut of the tours' profits. \"Who is watching the police?\" asked an editorial in La Razon newspaper. During the ensuing \"clean-up\", prisoners had their visitors' rights revoked for a day. A riot followed and around 80 children were evacuated.","In 2013, the story took an even darker turn when news spread of a 12-year-old girl becoming pregnant inside the jail, after an alleged rape by her imprisoned father and other men. Child welfare charities called for a ban on children living inside.","Large-scale tours of the prison are no longer possible. Today backpackers typically opt for La Paz walking tours, which stop outside the prison walls and tell Marching Powder's story.","When Rusty Young and Thomas McFadden returned to the prison for their forthcoming documentary Wildlands, they happened upon one such tour group and snuck alongside them, incognito.","\"They kept making factual errors, so I couldn't help asking smart-arsed questions,\" says Mr Young. Eventually an Irish traveller, who had just read the book, recognised the pair. \"He whispered, 'You're Rusty, You're Thomas!' And we sneaked off together for a beer.\"","Back in 2000, the two men travelled to Colombia, after Mr McFadden's release. They found work as English teachers and worked on the book, which became a New York Times best-seller.","Thomas then moved to Tanzania, and Rusty went back to Australia, where after the huge success of Marching Powder he had difficult-second-book syndrome. His novel Colombiano, about a teenager who gets drawn into a Colombian terrorist organisation, is due out later this year.","The documentary Wildlands uses their story in San Pedro Prison as a launch pad for exploring all sides of the drugs trade, and includes interviews with former undercover US police agents and an assassin who was a right-hand man to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar.","But the long-awaited Marching Powder feature film may still be years away. The rights were acquired by Brad Pitt's production company but have since expired. Narcos director Jose Padilha has been linked to the screenplay, and Don Cheadle and then Chiwetel Ejiofor expressed interest in playing Thomas McFadden, but filming never got off the ground.","As for the sequel to the book, perhaps that will come sooner. \"My publishers been harassing me about that for years,\" says Rusty. \"We already have a title: Marching On.\""],"targetTitle":"Bolivia's San Pedro 'tourist prison', 20 years on","targetDescription":"Marching Powder was a best-selling book among backpackers in South America, but what happened next?","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":75}

It sits in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, orbiting the sun at a distance almost 46 times farther away than Earth and completing an orbit once every 310 Earth-years. Recent observation by the Hubble Space Telescope, however, has revealed that Makemake is not as lonely as it once appeared: it has a moon.","Finding a Dark Moon","Until this new discovery, scientists believed Makemake was the only one of the four officially recognized dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt (Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Eris) without a moon - the fifth official dwarf planet, Ceres, is closer to Earth and also moonless. However, there were some inconsistencies in prior measurements of Makemake\u2019s light and heat. Observations from the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes revealed warm, dark areas on Makemake\u2019s otherwise bright, cold surface. However, Makemake\u2019s apparently mottled surface would not make sense with a normally rotating dwarf planet unless it was spinning with one of its poles facing directly toward Earth, a fairly unlikely situation. The \"dark moon hypothesis\" offered a simpler explanation: a charcoal-black moon orbiting Makemake. \"Imagine that the dark material isn\u2019t on Makemake\u2019s surface... it\u2019s in orbit!\" image analysis lead and paper coauthor Alex Parker tweeted. \"If the moon is very dark, it accounts for most previous thermal measurements!\"","Makemake is the second-farthest away of the official dwarf planets (Eris is the farthest) and the second-brightest (after Pluto). While it may seem strange that astronomers had been able to see moons around farther and dimmer planets while missing Makemake\u2019s moon, the reality is that this moon, informally called MK2, was very good at remaining hidden.","MK2 is over 1300 times dimmer and much smaller than Makemake, and its orbit appears to be edge-on to Earth, so we don\u2019t see it circling Makemake, only oscillating back and forth. Looking for it is like looking for a firefly flitting back and forth across a spotlight. If you watch it long enough and are lucky enough to look at the right time, as this team of astronomers did, the firefly might look obvious (in Parker\u2019s words, \"not actually that faint\"), but it was easy to miss before.","Part of a team from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, Parker was the first to notice Makemake\u2019s moon in data from the Hubble Space Telescope. At first, he","thought someone else must have already seen it. Just to be sure, he asked collaborator and team leader Marc Buie, \"Has anyone seen the moon in the Makemake data?\" When Buie replied, \"There\u2019s a moon in the Makemake data?\" they knew they\u2019d made a major discovery.","The Moon in the Data","It is unclear where exactly the moon came from or why its surface is black. More observations of MK2 from Hubble will help astronomers determine whether its orbit is circular or elliptical, which will provide clues to its origin. If MK2\u2019s orbit is elongated, it was probably simply captured in Makemake\u2019s gravity as it floated by. Many smaller Kuiper Belt Objects have dark surfaces like MK2. This is often because they are too small and their gravity too weak to keep bright ices (like the ones that cover Makemake) in place.","However, MK2\u2019s darkness could be due to constant interactions with the escaping atmospheric gases streaming off Makemake: like the top of a hearth blackened with ash, it could have accumulated compounds from Makemake\u2019s past atmosphere. If MK2\u2019s orbit is circular, as preliminary estimates indicate, the moon may be merely debris from a collision between Makemake and another Kuiper Belt Object. If MK2 was created by an enormous crash between two Kuiper Belt Objects, according to the paper, \"The apparent ubiquity of trans-Neptunian dwarf planet satellites further supports the idea that giant collisions are a near-universal fixture in the histories of these distant worlds.\" If all of the dwarf planets have satellites (moons), that may mean that Kuiper Belt Objects are often subjected to huge impacts.","The New, Improved Makemake System","While MK2 does create questions about the Makemake system and the Kuiper Belt, it will also provide answers. According to Parker, \"The discovery of this moon has given us an","opportunity to study Makemake in far greater detail than we ever would have been able to without the companion.\" ","Makemake is sometimes referred to as \"Pluto\u2019s little sister\" because of their similarities: both are dwarf planets, both have surfaces coated in methane ice, and both have temperatures that can drop to -400 degrees Fahrenheit. The discovery that Makemake has a moon adds yet another similarity to Pluto. When Pluto\u2019s largest moon, Charon, was discovered in 1978, it led to enormous new insights about Pluto itself, including that it was hundreds of times lighter than was originally estimated. \"That's the kind of transformative measurement that having a satellite can enable,\" Parker said: MK2 will almost definitely lead to a fundamental change in how we view the dwarf planet Makemake.","Looking at how MK2 orbits Makemake will allow scientists to calculate the system\u2019s mass and probe its inner composition. As Caltech\u2019s Mike Brown, a member of the team that discovered Makemake in 2005, said, \"The wide range of densities of the dwarf planets is one of the most interesting mysteries out there. But we still have so few objects that each one adds a critical part of the story.\" Small worlds like Makemake display a variety of internal compositions: they can contain rock and water ice, as well as other, more \"exotic\" ices and compounds. Since MK2 will allow scientists to tell Makemake\u2019s density and thus the densities of the materials it\u2019s made of, it provides a new clue about the family of dwarf planets.","The James Webb Space Telescope, scheduled to launch in 2018, will be able to conclusively test the dark moon hypothesis. Even before then, though, information about Makemake and its moon will continue to accumulate from new Hubble observations, teaching us about the outskirts of our solar system. \"This new discovery opens a new chapter in comparative planetology in the outer solar system,\" Buie said, and it will add to our understanding of the many worlds around us."],"targetTitle":"\"Pluto\u2019s Little Sister\" Makemake Has Something Even Pluto Doesn\u2019t","targetDescription":"\u2018Pluto\u2019s Little Sister\u2019 Makemake has grown up.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/space.washyourbrain.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/Makemake-805x589.jpg","http:\/\/1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/Obama-205x155.jpg","http:\/\/1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/makemake_nasa_big.jpg","http:\/\/secondnexus.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/makemake_nasa_big.jpg","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-q1u5wX8AfxWXr.gif","http:\/\/1wusz1l7dx227nr7mlgvjn14.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/o-ROUNDWORM-facebook-205x155.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/secondnexus.com\/technology-and-innovation\/makemakes-moon\/","id":76}

Golf\u2019s professional bodies have worked long and hard to integrate their sport into America\u2019s mainstream majority of tolerant society, the sport having started at member\u2019s only golf clubs which used to exclude women, African-Americans, Latinos and Jews from many private courses. So it only makes sense that they\u2019re following NBC\u2019s lead in firing the shameless race-baiter from hosting one of golf\u2019s top events now that he\u2019s hurting the sport\u2019s cash flow with his radioactive remarks.","The presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s golf resort business is going to be awfully lonely once six more months of his endlessly crass remarks of intolerance and hatred get plastered across the internet. Trump\u2019s open bigotry caused Cadillac to pull out as the title sponsor, and nobody else in corporate America wanted to touch Trump\u2019s signature golf course with a ten foot pole.","Trump handled the news poorly, blurting this out on a Fox News appearance: \"They\u2019re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. But they\u2019re moving it to Mexico City. And I\u2019m saying, you know, what\u2019s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what\u2019s going on with our country.\"","Donald Trump need only look in the mirror to see what\u2019s sad and wrong, because what\u2019s going on is Trump losing one of his golf crown jewels to Mexico due to his of stereotyping, hatred and bigotry."],"targetTitle":"PGA Just Cancelled A Huge Tournament At Trump\u2019s Resort.

Except for one particular style.","Ask your barber to scissor-cut the top of your head to about an inch and a half, adding a bit of texture to the ends with a razor. Around the sides and back, have him use a clipper to taper the length down to about a quarter inch, or an eighth if you feel like going really short.","This gives the face a squared look, where the sides are blended straight up and the top is slicked back with no visible part.","The heavy-on-top style is juxtaposed with a side of cool, with facial hair and cool specs.","You could achieve a formal look by slicking the full part of your hair with a hairdryer and a Denman brush for volume. Spritz some hairspray to firm it up.","Asymmetrical faux hawks give the appearance of playfulness. Get some gel and gather your hair up to one side with your fingers. Beau-haute!","Wavy hair? No problem. The clean and classy look works very well here too!","Pop culture and the media has a huge influence on how men sport their hair, so it's no surprise men emulate the hairstyles of their favorite musicians and celebrities to reflect the times. They even find inspiration from past trends, making everything old, new again. TV shows like Mad Men brought back the Don Draper cut, with tightened sides and a sharp part on the left side of the head that was typical among business professionals in the late 60s.With a population of roughly 318 million people here in the U.S., there is a huge range of styles and opinions when it comes to haircuts. But which is the cut that gets requested the most? GQ recently asked 500 barbers and stylists across our nation for the top three most requested haircuts. Their expectations about haircut preferences varying by region were...cut short. Before revealing the most requested haircut, here's a look at what's not on the top of everyone's list. Perhaps the mullet dominates in Kentucky or Oklahoma. Popularized by musicians like Rod Stewart and David Bowie (RIP), the mullet was predominant as far back as the early 70s. Some guys prefer to stay stuck in the era of disco. Still, it is not a popular haircut. No judgment here. You do your 'do the way you do!Perhaps the buzzcut is favored more in Iowa.Sadly, the buzzcut lacks the length of hair enough to be sweeping the nation. Maybe the Southwest prefers the Caesar's cut.None of these styles were in hot demand. But when all the data was compiled, there was one haircut that was consistently favored among men from Schenectady to Cincinnati, Portland to Nashville, Juneau to NYC, and every city in between. So which cut made the cut? There's no official name for the style, but it's basically the 'undercut,' long on top and short on the sides. The clean-cut style of a longer crown with a clipper cut fade on the sides won out as the preferred cut of choice. The prime example of the desired haircut is sported here by one of the most desirable men in Hollywood: Ryan Reynolds.The style is easily adaptable for both casual and formal occasions. This haircut works with most types of hair, including thick, wavy and curly hair. Want the same haircut? GQ shares how to ask your barber for the popular cut:The popular style is also easy to maintain, and there are plenty of options to play with.The word is out. This is the nation's popular haircut for now. But how long can it last? Will barbers be forever shearing this time-transcending method of the undercut, or will the style last as briefly as a cheap bottle of Dep gel? Time will tell, but since it's summer, it's gotta feel wonderful to clipper-cut the sides of your head. Your head will feel cool in the summer heat, and you'll be looking even cooler!

It felt like every last pore on my face was being tightened and pulled by a gigantic vacuum cleaner. I don't know how else to describe it! I could feel a warm tingling sensation on my cheeks, around my eyes, and on my forehead. I looked in the mirror and saw that my face looked a bit rosy - the result of revitalizing blood rushing to the surface of my skin to renew my face. After both products were absorbed into my skin, my face looked firmer and had a beautiful glow to it.","day 5: After five days of using Neuphoric Anti-Aging Cream , I was shocked at the drastic results. The lines, dark spots, and wrinkles - without question - were visibly reduced in size right before my eyes! I was astonished by the results, and literally felt 15 years younger again. It was like watching all my wrinkles and fine lines vanish right off!","day 14: After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and scepticism absolutely vanished - SO DID MY WRINKLES! The lines on my forehead, the loose, sagging skin on my neck, my crows feet even the age spots on my face had COMPLETELY disappeared. I've never felt or seen anything tighten my skin with this kind of force before, no matter how expensive the product! After the 2 weeks, my skin not only stayed that way, it actually improved every day until it became as beautiful and radiant as it was 20 years ago. By this point, all my friends and family were shocked. They couldn't believe the difference, and were convinced I was lying about not getting botox!","The Verdict:","Using the Neuphoric Anti-Aging Cream daily removed virtually 90% of all her wrinkles and problem areas. It tightened her face and neck, removing all signs of sagging, aging, and dehydrated skin.","We had her track her progress for the 14 day test.

The main reason of excitement for this new AAA game is the setting.","Unlike most of the other shooting games nowadays, which are set in modern or futuristic universe, Battlefield 1 is set during World War I. This will definitely give the players some new experience and a fresh perspective.","Although we are all excited about Battlefield 1, we are actually lucky that the game\u2019s setting didn\u2019t get rejected. While speaking at the Investors Day event, EA Studios Executive Vice President Patrick Soderlund said that the setting was originally not approved by EA.","The thing that Andrew spoke about in regards to the setting and why we decided to go for World War I, it wasn\u2019t the most obvious choice. If you look at what other partners in our industry are going, they\u2019re going into sci-fi, we had a lot of success with in the modern military space, but we felt that there was a need for a change, and when the team presented to me the idea of World War I, I absolutely rejected it.\"","However, things changed after DICE showed him a small demo of what it had in mind. This convinced him that the idea could actually work and the company bit the bullet and it paid off big time.","I said , World War I is trench warfare, it can\u2019t be fun to play.\u2019 But anyway the team continued to persist in the fact that this can be fun, and showed up with a very short demo that convinced me at least that this was the right path","Soderlund was amazed by the reception the trailer for Battlefield 1 got and he seemed very pleased that the audience connected in the way it did with the company\u2019s decision to switch from modern-day setting to world war 1.","The good news is that whenever you take creative risks, and it works, you actually can get to substantial success, and I think that what the internet is telling us with 31 million views and the most seen trailer of the history of EA is that the World War I theme is resonating with players out there. I think we have done something that will be right for the franchise and right for EA.\"","Battlefield 1 is looking set to break all kinds of sales records and this might finally be the year when it manages to dethrone the Call of Duty franchise from the number 1 position."],"targetTitle":"EA \"Absolutely Rejected\" Battlefield 1\u2019s World War 1 Setting Before This Made It Change Its Minds","targetDescription":"World war 1 setting for Battlefield 1 one might not have been approved but for this.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/pokemon-go-nick_statt-2016-2.0.0-100x70.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/gamespot-1.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/fragherow.png","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=21200650&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/fraghero-alt.png","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/667.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/battlefield-com.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/vikrambw.png","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/deadp2-500x300.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/n64-100x70.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/638fc971f23609c8e5aa7d9b84081a93-100x70.jpg","http:\/\/fraghero.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/f5274d5c14b303f2fd794acd3489978a-100x70.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/fraghero.com\/battlefield-1s-world-war-1-setting-was-initially-rejected\/","id":89}

THE SMELL.","\u00a9 Provided by Delish","I don't have to be too close to ketchup to know when it's around. It has that stinky tomato smell ... rancid even. And it lingers ... FOREVER. Hours.","5. I CAN NEVER ESCAPE IT.","As a ketchup hater, you can imagine the disappointment and utter grotesque when you sit down at a restaurant, whether it's a dive diner or upscale bistro, and have to share your meal with a bottle of the red stuff. Or when you order fries, they arrive with ketchup, and you have to spend the next five minutes tracking down your waitress just to get the condiment you really want with fries ... mayo! Do you know how many delicious French fries I've had to enjoy with my eyes closed? So that I don't have to bite into them with a vat of liquid red staring back at me? Even worse, when the ketchup and fries arrive together, with a few of the fries touching the villain.","6. Y'ALL ARE TOO OBSESSED WITH IT.","I wish America's sweetheart could be something more interesting than ketchup, but alas, the numbers speak. While mayo still ranks as the most popular condiment in America, ketchup is a close second. And that's because there isn't anything we're not dousing it on. Eggs are one that hurt my heart, and don't even get me started on omelets. But beyond that, hash browns, grilled cheese, chicken nuggets all disappoint me in their own way.","7. IT DOESN'T BELONG ON A DAMN HOT DOG.","Nope, I'm not a Chicago native, but I do still think this is a sin. Mustard (maybe sauerkraut, too) on dogs only, never ketchup.","Now Watch How to Make Homemade Ketchup:"],"targetTitle":"7 Reasons Why You Should Never Eat Ketchup","targetDescription":"\u200bDon't

{"postId":"622416023829020672","postText":["This CEO's first job? A Hooters girl"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Some successful people always knew what they wanted to do and had a plan. From a young age, they methodically plotted their way up the ladder. You look at their career path, and where they started \u2014 and where they ended \u2014 makes total sense.","There are many people who have become wildly successful whose careers had unexpected, even weird starts. They may have stumbled onto their vocations. Or they always had a passion \u2014 but found a very unorthodox way of finding their routes to achieving their dreams.","Take Jonathan Goldsmith, the actor who plays the \"Most Interesting Man in the World\" character in commercials for Dos Equis. After first moving to Los Angeles, he worked on a garbage truck, according to an NPR interview. He lied his way into westerns, pretending to know how to ride a horse, and eventually played villains, even though he had always wanted to do comedy. He finally got a chance, decades after starting acting and while trying to refresh his movie career by auditioning for a commercial by imitating his sailing buddy, Fernando Lamas.","\"It only took 50 years,\" Goldsmith said. \"An overnight success.\"","Even CEOs and power brokers have had unconventional starts. Andrew Carnegie\u2019s first job was as a 13-year-old textile worker. John D. Rockefeller was an accountant. Tim Armstrong, AOL\u2019s CEO before the acquisition by Verizon, was a teacher.","So, if you\u2019re one of the millions of newly-minted college graduates not sure of what\u2019s next\u2013 or the parent of one \u2014 take heart. There are many paths to business in success. Here are some of the more unusual stories of people who started in non-traditional beginnings and yet rose to high-profile positions that brought them wealth and fame.","Kat Cole","Position: CEO of Cinnabon","Unusual start: Hooters girl","As a teenager, she wanted to be a corporate lawyer and needed to save for college. So, at age 17, she became a hostess at a local Hooters and then, when she turned 18, a waitress \u2014 a Hooters girl. But she was a go-getter and by 19 was asked by the company to travel to different countries to help open foreign markets.","At 23, she was in charge of global training for employees and managers. She never finished the bachelor\u2019s degree, although eventually she got her MBA. \"I was lucky that Hooters wasn\u2019t a more sophisticated company, because there\u2019s no way someone my age would have had those chances,\" she said. \"It wasn\u2019t like people graduating from Ivy League schools were dying to get a corporate job at Hooters.\"","Richard Branson","Position: Founder and Chairman, Virgin Group","Unusual Start: Hit record producer","Branson started a magazine when he was only 16, but really set off his career as an entrepreneur at 22 when he opened a recording studio and brought in singer Mike Oldfield. The result was a single called \"Tubular Bells,\" which stayed on the U.K. charts for close to five years. \"On the back of that, we built a record company, and one thing led to another,\" he told BusinessInsider.","Mark Cuban","Position: Owner, Dallas Mavericks, Co-owner, Wagner\/Cuban Companies, Chairman and CEO of AXS tv, investor","Unusual Start: Disco dancing instructor","Mark Cuban was an entrepreneur from his early years, when he sold garbage bags to pay for basketball shoes when he was 12. He started a number of businesses when a student at Indiana University, but the most colorful had to be teaching disco dancing. \"If you get asked by a bunch of sorority girls to come to a sorority house to teach girls how to dance for $25 an hour, you do it,\" he told the Wall Street Journal.","Steve Jobs","Position: Late CEO, Apple","Unusual Start: Selling illegal telephone hacking equipment","In the 1970s, telephone systems were far different than today. They used tone signals to control long-distance dialing. Jobs and his friend and Apple co-founder, Steve Wozniak, had their first business: illegally selling so-called blue boxes that would allow people to break into the telephone system and make free calls. \"If it hadn\u2019t been for the blue boxes, there would have been no Apple,\" he said in a 1994 video interview. \"I\u2019m 100 percent sure of that. Woz and I learned how to work together, and we gained the confidence that we could solve technical problems and actually put something into production.\"","Les Moonves","Position: CEO, CBS","Unusual Start: Acting","Before he got into the production end of the business, Moonves was a struggling actor in New York. After playing a few small tough guy rolls in such series as the \"Six Million Dollar Man\" and \"Cannon,\" he gave up acting and switched careers. \"I was mediocre,\" he told Fortune.","Sumner Redstone","Position:  Chairman, Viacom and CBS","Unusual Start: Spy","During the Second World War, Redstone was part of an intelligence unit responsible for breaking the communications codes of the Japanese, which meant learning the language and culture. \"The work was so intensive that at some point I knew the meaning of more Japanese [pictogram] characters than the average Japanese on the street,\" he wrote in his 2001 biography, A Passion to Win. \"Breaking the Japanese code was one of the turning points of the war and I was proud to have made a small contribution to the effort.\"","However, he found it \"tragic and unfair\" that Japanese-American citizens, most of whom \"must have been extremely loyal citizens,\" were not allowed in the facilities, which also slowed progress."],"targetTitle":"Unusual jobs CEOs had before they became successful","targetDescription":"Whether teaching disco dancing or working as a spy, these people vaulted to the top from unusual beginnings.","targetKeywords":"most interesting man, CEOs, Kat Cole, Mark Cuban, Steve Jobs, Les Moonves, Sumner Redstone, leadership","targetMedia":["data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/gettyimages-93410952.jpg?w=720","https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/07\/gettyimages-93410952.jpg?w=1100&quality=85"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1HEa1Gx","id":92}

Carr had purchased the vehicle over a half-century earlier at a cost of \u00a3895 - the equivalent of \u00a315,500 today, or around $22,200.","Paul Cooper via MailOnline","It is highly coveted by collectors as only 17 were ever made and at least four of those are thought to belong to the Musee Nationale de L'Automobile in Mulhouse, France.","The nephew who wished to remain anonymous also told Mail Online, \"We knew he had some cars, but we had no idea what they were.","\"It was a bit of local folklore that he had a Bugatti, but no one knew for sure.

It's a wonderful thing to leave.\"","He also described his uncle, explaining that he was \"a very eccentric old gent,\" adding, \"I suppose you could call him a mad doctor. People who saw him in the street thought he was a tramp. He would wear two pairs of trousers at the same time.\"","Bonhams via MailOnline","In his later years, the doctor was said to have suffered from a form of obsessive compulsive disorder and hoarded everything in the house he refused to leave. Files were piled six feet high at his home, and they even included receipts for pencils he purchased in the 1950s.","\"Since he died, it has taken me 18 months to get where I am today,\" the nephew said.

Here's Why!"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["Infertility is no longer seen only in women. With the adoption of modern lifestyles, men, too are becoming infertile these days.","A renowned gynecologist and infertility and in vitro fertilisation specialist, Dr. Sonia Malik, at one of the leading fertility treatment centres in New Delhi, stated that 46% of Indians, between the ages of 31 and 40 years, need medical intervention to conceive. This is because one or both partners in the relationship are suffering from fertility problems. Another city gynaecologist named, Dr. Yashica Gudesar, said one of the main reasons causing infertility is polycystic ovarian disorder in women and reduced sperm count in men.","Studies also suggest that it is wrong to blame the women all the time for being infertile. Statistically, in nearly 30% of all infertility cases, men have been found to be infertile, as per Society for the Study of Male Reproduction.","Some of the reasons that doctors have stated for this problem is irregular working hours and work stress in the IT, media industry and BPOs. Apparently, constant use of Android or iPhone affects sperm count as they have higher emission rate. Environmental pollution also to some extent contributes to low sperm count. The food you eat and your sleeping patterns have also found to affect the quality of sperms and eggs these days. Moreover, men who smoke cigarettes regularly are at an increased risk of infertility says, Dr. Ved Prakash.","But dear men, worry not! There is a solution to every problem. And while cutting down on your smokes and adopting a better lifestyle is one of them, it\u2019s not the only one. IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection offers a good chance of pregnancy. Nowadays, people are becoming more open to consulting IVF centers for problems relating to infertility such as erectile dysfunction, or not being able to have a child.

Here\u2019s Why"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["A Democratic presidential candidate has not won a majority of votes in Nebraska for more than 50 years. But on Thursday, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign announced it would begin spending precious advertising dollars in the state. The advertising buy is focused on Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district, and includes two ads about Clinton\u2019s advocacy for children.","It is an expensive bet on a state that has almost always voted red. But there\u2019s a simple reason behind what seems like a gamble: Nebraska allocates its electoral college votes not in the usual winner-take-all method, but by congressional district. So a Republican candidate can win in the state, but a Democratic candidate can still pick up electoral votes by winning over a district.","The second congressional district, which is centered in Omaha and its suburbs, has a history of occasionally voting differently from the rest of deep-red Nebraska.","The district went for Mitt Romney in 2012 but for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008. In 2014, when Democrats lost a wave of congressional races across the country, Democrat Brad Ashford won the district\u2019s seat in U.S. Congress. And as a Clinton aide pointed out, the African-American share of the vote in the district is higher than the statewide average\u2014and Clinton has shown she consistently over-performs among black voters.","The electoral college\u2019s winner-take-all system means that reliably Democratic states like Massachusetts and Oregon\u2014or reliably Republican states like Texas and Alabama\u2014are never seriously contested by presidential candidates. They predictably vote Democratic or Republican. But in Nebraska and Maine\u2014the two states that allocate their electoral votes by congressional district\u2014there is more room for the parties to maneuver. They can spend ad dollars and campaign in states that they could never win outright.","It\u2019s an electoral strategy that Donald Trump is hoping to take advantage of, too. This week he campaigned in Maine, which also allocates its electoral votes by congressional district but usually supports a Democrat. He held a rally in Bangor in the state\u2019s second congressional district, which is predominantly white and rural.","Clinton has begun a broad and expensive advertising campaign in the swing states that you\u2019d expect: Florida, Ohio, Colorado, Iowa, Nevda, New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina. In those states, as well as in her Nebraska ad buy, Clinton has aired advertisements that tout her role in the creation of the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program in the 1990s.","These are the two ads that will be playing in Nebraska."],"targetTitle":"Hillary Clinton Is Advertising in Deep-Red Nebraska.

It\u2019s one of his worst yet."],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["THE MORNING PLUM:","Believe it or not, Donald Trump has now made a very important policy statement. Introducing what he billed as an \"energy plan,\" Trump promised to \"cancel the Paris Climate Plan.\" Unlike so much of what comes from Trump on policy, this is a genuinely clarifying moment, with potentially enormous long-term implications.","The near-term political consequences of this will \u2014 or should \u2014 be that there is now no chance whatsoever that Bernie Sanders will do anything at all on his way out that could imperil party unity in a way that makes a Trump victory more likely. I don\u2019t believe Sanders has any intention to do that, by the way, but this should theoretically render it an impossibility in his mind, because it dramatically increases the stakes for a relatively smooth resolution of the Democratic primaries. Indeed, I believe it\u2019s likely Sanders will see it this way, too.","To get all the details on Trump\u2019s full energy plan, read Brad Plumer\u2019s piece. Trump would pursue a mostly standard-issue GOP agenda of \"fewer regulations and more fossil fuel production.\" More important, with some reporters wondering what Trump\u2019s actual views are on global climate change, he clarified them: He is utterly indifferent to its existence and would roll back the main things we\u2019re currently putting in place to deal with it.","Trump said that the current environmental challenges that the Obama administration is trying to tackle are \"phony.\" He added that he would \"rescind\" the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which would curb carbon dioxide emissions from existing coal-fired power plants, and is key to the U.S.\u2019s ability to meet its commitments as part of the global climate deal. He would withdraw the U.S. from participation in that global accord.","As I\u2019ve reported before, there are complexities that could make it harder than expected for a Republican president \u2014 even one as masterfully competent and strong as Trump \u2014 to roll back the Clean Power Plan and\/or withdraw from the Paris climate deal. But it\u2019s possible that Trump could accomplish one or both of these, which would be a tremendous setback.","This deepens the contrast between Trump and Hillary Clinton. While Clinton would not be as ambitious as Sanders in tackling the climate challenge, the unalterable fact of the matter is that Clinton would preserve and implement the Clean Power Plan and the global climate accord, and Trump would seek to reverse them both.","Sanders has repeatedly described the climate challenge as the single greatest long-term threat we face:","Climate change is the single greatest threat facing our planet. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016","And:","As a father of four and a grandfather of seven, I care about leaving a healthy, livable planet for all of our kids and grandchildren. \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) April 7, 2016","It\u2019s true that Sanders has criticized the global climate deal as insufficient. But Sanders surely knows that continuing to implement it \u2014 and the Clean Power Plan \u2014 are infinitely preferable to rolling them back, which could lay the groundwork for catastrophe. Sanders knows that the Paris accord may end up being our best near term hope for building an international effort to tackle the climate problem. Implementing it could allow us to get to the point where dramatic innovations in energy technology begin to make solving the problem a realistic possibility. What\u2019s more, even if the Paris accord is currently not enough, it can be built upon later. The accord is not guaranteed to succeed, but trying to implement and build upon it makes success more likely. Obviously, if our participation in it is canceled, building upon it is no longer possible.","It is often said that Sanders may not help to unify the party because he has \"nothing to lose\" from a Democratic loss. I think that is wrong \u2014 I believe Sanders when he says a Trump presidency is unthinkable. And at any rate, the incentives, if anything, favor Sanders helping to unify the party, in order to maximize his and his movement\u2019s influence going forward. Trump has now clarified beyond any doubt just how much, by Sanders\u2019 own lights, we all have to lose from a Trump presidency. My bet is Sanders will seize on this to make the case to his supporters that the stakes in this election require a full commitment to Trump\u2019s defeat, even if that means supporting a flawed alternative."],"targetTitle":"Donald Trump just made an extremely important promise.

{"postId":"807797062762987523","postText":["These extraordinary holiday trips will be the highlight of your year:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["One clear travel trend this year is that more Asians are becoming free independent travelers (FIT), eschewing the ordinariness of coach travel for the novelty  and bragging rights  of new places and experiences.","Here are five extraordinary trips for them to make this holiday season.","1. Adventurous Christmas: Chile","Torres del Paine, one of Chile's wondrous sights. Photo credit: Shutterstock.","The sights are stupendous and varied: sand dunes, salt lakes, towering peaks, glaciers, geysers, lakes. Chile has it all in vivid colors.","Use the capital Santiago as a hub and fly to hot spots like the Atacama Desert in the north, Patagonia in the south, or the mysterious Easter Island, famous for its nearly 900 monumental human figures with oversized heads carved right out of a volcanic mountain, then transported to different parts of the island  a gargantuan feat for mere humans.","Another highlight of a Chile trip, especially for avid hikers, is a 19km hike to the base of Torres del Paine (Towers of Paine) to view the three 2,000-meter granite towers in all their splendor, a sight guaranteed to floor anyone.","Chileans are friendly and hosts at heart. The best time to visit is November to early March, so it's perfect for the holiday season.","Where to stay: Awasi Atacama.","2. Premium Christmas: Switzerland","Car-free Zermatt (Canton Valais). Photo credit: Switzerland Tourism\/\/Christof Sonderegger.","For a holiday as rich as Christmas pudding, Switzerland is hard to beat. Think spellbinding street lights and snowy villages, where the only problem you face is too much choice of where to go. Though it's small, Switzerland is multifaceted with a variety of history and traditions.","For cities, Zurich has the largest indoor Christmas market in Europe (until Christmas Eve) in the main hall of the Central Station where you can gorge on local treats from 160 stalls while your eyes feast on a Christmas tree decorated with 10,000 Swarovski crystals. Other highlights include a unique singing tree in town (come closer to the tree and you'll see it is actually filled with children singing Christmas songs) and the release of 800 floating candles into the River Limmat on December 22.","Then head to Zermatt for an alpine experience. It's car-free, leaving the snow-covered streets gorgeously illuminated for the holidays. And the Matterhorn never fails to mesmerize. There also aren't any large crowds at this time, making this a sublime place to have a Silent Night, Holy Night moment filled with love and gratitude.","Where to stay: The Dolder Grand (Zurich); Le Petit Cervin or the Bellerive (Zermatt).","3. Christmas in Santa's home: Finland","Northern Lights, Finland. Photo credit: Visit Finland.","Everyone knowns Santa lives in Finnish Lapland and it's time you pay him a visit for all those times he came to your house. At least that's according to Visit Finland, Finland's official tourism promoter which, together with Finnair, has been recently courting Asian visitors  to visit the country.","Lapland, the largest and northernmost region of Finland, has 190,000 reindeers, 749 mountains and one Santa Claus. While there is a Santa's Village there, this amusement park may be too commercialized for some. Best to check out hotels and resorts that offer a more authentic experience where the highlights can include visits to husky and reindeer farms, hunts for the Northern Lights with a guide, snow mobile safaris and winter fishing.","Finland will mark its 100th year of independence next year and to mark the occasion, Visit Finland has launched a StopOver Finland initiative comprising 50 easily reachable packages\/services lasting five hours to five days. It's also worth mentioning that Finland is the shortest connection between Europe and Asia, giving you even more reason to make the comparatively short trip.","Experiences available to Asian tourists include running tours of Helsinki, a two-day package to see the Northern Lights and a one-day trip incorporating two capital cities, Tallinn and Helsinki.","4. Christmas-at-sea: Genting Dream","Party all night at Zouk on board Genting Dream. Photo credit: Dream Cruises.","If you're after something different, why not eschew your boarding pass for a spot on a cruise? Hop onto Genting Dream, the first cruise ship of Asia's first luxury cruise line, Dream Cruises. It sails out from Hong Kong or Guangzhou in the south of China, and takes you to scenic destinations in Vietnam including Ha Long Bay and Danang.","As with all firsts, it's out to impress so you can expect keen service and a sparkling new vessel with such a wide range of facilities and entertainment it could be considered a destination on its own. This includes a waterslide park, Zouk nightclub (famous for its Singapore and Kuala Lumpur locations), more than 35 restaurant and bar concepts, the first Penfolds flagship wine vault at sea and a Dreamscapes enrichment program that will offer talks and presentations from esteemed speakers. Joining the cruise on December 10, for instance, is American astronaut Dr. Leroy Chiao, who will deliver a three-part lecture.","5. Break the bank Christmas: The Maldives","A Garden Villa at Cheval Blanc, Randheli. Photo credit: Cheval Blanc, Randheli.","The best time to visit the Maldives is from the second half of December to April, making it another destination pick that's perfect for the holiday season.","If you've been rewarded with a bonus as fat as Santa himself, treat yourself to a stay at Cheval Blanc Randheli. Owned by LVMH, it's one of the most stylish resorts in the Maldives with its contemporary minimalist design (by architect Jean Michel-Gathy), spaciousness (not just the size of the room; the resort's spa occupies another whole adjacent island), and extensive facilities to suit any tastes or needs (you have your own majordome for the entire stay who caters to your likes\/dislikes and ensures your day runs just as you wish)."],"targetTitle":"Five Extraordinary Trips To Make This Holiday Season","targetDescription":"One clear travel trend this year is that more Asians are becoming free independent travelers, eschewing the ordinariness of coach travel for the novelty \u2013 and bragging rights \u2013 of new places and experiences.","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":100}

BE WARNED..."],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["It is not uncommon to hear about somebody being stung by a bee or a wasp of some sort, as such type of insects and little bugs are very common in the outdoors.","While getting stung by a bumblebee may hurt, it is not dangerous at all and is in fact worse for the bee itself rather than for the person that got stung. Yellow jackets and wasps pose a whole new threat though, because they are faster, stronger, and have much more powerful poison in their stingers than bees do.","That is why if somebody is allergic to bee stings, getting stung by a wasp can be extremely painful, and sometimes even fatal if not handled correctly.","One man from Tampa, Florida, was out gardening on a seemingly normal day when he did not notice a wasp nest hidden beneath some plants in his front lawn.","John Clark missed the nest, and accidentally stepped on it, ushering a swarm of yellow jackets to come out and attack him.","John got stung four times, and made his way inside to rest and get treatment.","Hi wife went and grabbed John an ice pack to help reduce the swelling, and John sat down to try and recover from the extremely painful stings that were attacking his body.","Soon after getting stung though, John started acting strange. He started experiencing numbness, and had difficulty breathing. Something was evidently not right.","It was only an hour after getting stung when John was gasping for air and told his wife three last words, \"I love you\" before he took his last breath and died. Doctors did everything they could to get his system back up and running, but to no avail.","This was the case of a severe allergic reaction that John had experienced called anaphylaxis. This type of condition can be triggered from an allergic reaction from a wasp like John was stung by, but this type of condition is extremely dangerous due to its stealth.","Many people do not even know they can get anaphylaxis from a wasp or bee sting, and anybody can develop it at any point in their lifetime.

{"postId":"4q3xfu","postText":["The Dish You Should Never Order in Rome"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["When it comes to dining in Rome, there's a pasta dish to avoid\u2014unless you know the one place to try it.","There seems to be molto confusion around the origins of fettuccine Alfredo. Ask any true Roman about it and you'll be met with a befuddled \"who is-a Alfredo?\" That's because, fellow Americans, Roman children didn't grow up scarfing down plates of this creamy comfort food like we did here. (Then again, Olive Garden has yet to hit Mediterranean shores.) Alfredo, after all, isn't found alongside carbonara and amatriciana in the pantheon of celebrated local dishes\u2014not because it isn't Roman, but because it never spread throughout the city. Its origins lay in a single, no-name trattoria on a side street near the Trevi Fountain. In the early 1900s, the eponymous Alfredo di Lielo needed a calorific meal to feed his pregnant wife. So he combined butter and cheese and melted it over fettuccine noodles. Sated, his wife insisted he add it to his menu.","But it remained a strictly of-the-house specialty. Despite the acclaim (rumors swirl that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks ate it on their Roman holiday in 1927), other trattorias likely rejected it due to inauthenticity. Alfredo used parmigiano for the cheese (a bold move in Pecorino Romano country) and butter, which was pretty much as foreign an ingredient to Italians at the time as milk was to the Japanese. But it did take off stateside thanks to a Pennsylvania noodle company: Pennsylvania Dutch marketed a creamy sauce called Alfredo after influential New York restaurateur George Renart raved about the dish in the Saturday Evening Post when he returned from a trip to Rome. The version we eat now\u2014loaded with cream, often with chicken\u2014is a bastardization of what Alfredo cooked up a century ago. And it's definitely not what you would find in Rome now, even if those trattorias from Testaccio to Prati had Alfredo on the menu (which they don't).","Should we just quit the search and make do with carbonara instead? Local food expert Elizabeth Minchilli says no way. \"I always encourage travelers to seek out Alfredo in Rome,\" she says. \"You just need to know where to go.\" That would be Trattoria della Scrofa, between Piazza Navona and the Trevi Fountain, a 103-year-old restaurant that Alfredo started after his first spot was flattened to make space for a shopping center. What you\u2019ll get is a heaping plate of pasta prepped as Alfredo did it all those years ago: hot noodles, on a hot plate, mixed with (lots of) softened butter and (lots of) grated parmigiano right at your table. What you won\u2019t get is cream, garlic, or an overwhelming crush of travelers. Which, in Rome, is rewarding in its own right."],"targetTitle":"The Dish You Should Never Order in Rome","targetDescription":"When it comes to dining in Rome, there's one pasta dish to avoid, and one you shouldn't leave the city without trying.","targetKeywords":"food-drink,contributor\/context-travel,daily-traveler\/2014\/05\/the-best-food-in-rome","targetMedia":["http:\/\/www.cntraveler.com\/images\/ecom\/failsafe\/TVL_Failsafe_Navbar_Rollover_970x250.v1c.jpg","https:\/\/media.cntraveler.com\/photos\/53daa82d6dec627b149f9803\/master\/pass\/best-restaurants-rome.jpg","http:\/\/www.cntraveler.com\/cnt-f-core-img\/failsafe\/TVL_Failsafe_Footer_950x560.jpg","http:\/\/www.cntraveler.com\/images\/cnt-print-logo.gif","http:\/\/www.cntraveler.com\/cnt-f-core-img\/failsafe\/TVL_Failsafe_Mobile_300x100.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.cntraveler.com\/stories\/2014-05-12\/the-best-food-in-rome","id":106}

Within six months to a year of starting my diet, my weight would creep back up to my heaviest.","Shopping for clothes was pure hell for me. I ate myself up to a size 5XL and 30-32 blouses, 28-32 pants and 50 bra. I didn't have a lap; I couldn't hold my beautiful grandkids.","Breaking Point: Three things: In July 2013, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Dallas and the seat belt barely fit around me. I was so embarrassed and wanted to cry.

I had had enough.","I went to dinner to celebrate July birthdays in my family. We all gathered to take pictures.

I looked at that woman in the picture and asked, \"Who are you?\" I didn't know the woman looking back at me.","How I Lost It: The initial start was to remove sugar from my diet, stop late-night eating and start using the gym membership that I had been paying for for two years. I knew I had to do something different this time. I had to find a way to make it work longterm. I knew \u200bgiving up too much and feeling deprived wasn't going to work this time.","I looked at every diet plan I'd ever been on and came up with a lifestyle plan that would that fit my daily routine and give me long-term results. Because at the end of every diet, you've got to get back to real life.","For the first 30 days, I didn't eat any potatoes, pasta, white rice, flour, soda or sugar, and I drank no less than a gallon of water a day. I've learned to read labels. My meals consisted of baked chicken, fish and vegetables. As much as I try to stay away from processed foods, in some cases, it's hard to avoid, so moderation is the key.","I make my own snacks, like roasted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, almonds, pistachios, cashews and roasted chickpeas. I lost 20 pounds in 30 days and started going to the gym. I was sore for \u200bthree months straight, but I kept going every day. Even after losing 20 pounds, I could only walk on the treadmill at the lowest speed, but I kept going. I would be on it for an hour, take a break and get right back on. I stuck with the treadmill for the first nine months.","Now, I love going to the gym, and my energy level is off the charts. Everybody who knows me is cheering me on. I want to do everything: Spinning, dancing, running, horseback riding, traveling the world. Now, I can walk on the treadmill on its highest level for 45 to 50 minutes. For someone who could barely walk up a flight of stairs without being winded, I feel like I got my life back!","I'm no longer on any of the medications.

Unconditional \u2014 they can do anything they want with it \u2014 which is incredibly empowering to recipients, but many people in \u2018the west\u2019 think it\u2019s risky...or even foolish.","We\u2019ve told countless friends and family about GiveDirectly, and the concept of transferring cash is met with much skepticism; soliciting responses such as \"eh, I only give people food,\" and others such as;","\"How do they make sure people aren\u2019t defrauding them or stealing the cash?\"","\"I bet most people waste or squander the cash.\"","\"It probably doesn\u2019t have long-term impact, such as building a school could.\"","\"General angst about the \"Savior Barbie\" complex, where western people go out to save people in poor countries by telling them what they should do \u2014 often a self-serving endeavor.\"","...and more.","After dealing with the frequent barrage of opposing views, but always holding strong to our personal convictions; we decided to dig for some more answers \u2014 and see how many of these holes they were poking in our own justifications could be filled. Since we currently travel abroad full-time, and Kenya is an incredible country, we decided to head out for a field visit and take a real peek under the hood of GD\u2019s operation.","Outside of GiveDirectly\u2019s Country Headquarters in Kisumu, Kenya","In August 2016, my wife and I visited GiveDirectly\u2019s office in Kisumu, Kenya and spent two 10-hour days in the field, visiting real past recipients in the Siaya (where President Obama\u2019s grandmother lives!) and Homa Bay regions. After meeting the team on the ground and hearing about their day to day work, we were really surprised and impressed by five main things that actually directly addressed a lot of the negative feedback we\u2019ve heard in the past:",") The vast majority of the team are local Kenyans; only two of around 80 or so employees are expats. We think that\u2019s fantastic, since we\u2019ve already known that 91% of the cash that we personally give to GD goes directly into the field, but actually a solid portion of the 9% administrative cost actually funnels into creating local jobs that afford hundreds more people in East Africa the opportunity to build bright futures for themselves. There\u2019s a huge unemployment issue in Kenya and other East African countries and foreign investment is still far behind demand, so this kind of job creation has a huge impact on the community.","Beyond the employment opportunity, the real incredible moments for us came when we had the chance to speak individually with a few of the locals on the team. Candidly; they are all proud to be working their asses off to improve the lives of people in their own community. We even heard two separate stories from some senior-level guys (still under 30 years old) who were driven to work at GiveDirectly after having their own first real exposure to abject poverty; even just a few miles from where they lived. They were moved to make a difference, to pour their energy every day into giving other people in their community better lives.","Cavin Oginga (from Kenya) \u2014 A Field Ops Manager for GiveDirectly \u2014 who applied for a job there after running a research project on GiveDirectly\u2019s work (for poverty-action.org) and seeing what a massive impact they were having.","One of the most interesting stories we heard was about a young woman who received a cash transfer from GiveDirectly in 2014. She used a large portion of the transfer to cover her school fees so that she could complete her schooling, and then graduated and immediately sought employment. She applied to work for GiveDirectly (GD often has 200\u2013600 applicants for any one vacancy) and she got the job. From living off of less than one dollar a day, to now being employed in one of the most competitive roles available, the cash transfer from GiveDirectly has completely altered the path of her life, and she will reach heights that only two years ago she would have thought to be completely unattainable for her.","2.) There was really no \"savior barbie\" complex in the GiveDirectly operation \u2014 no one is coming in from wealthy nations and telling anyone else how to live their own lives and what\u2019s best for them, and no one here is swooping in from some rich country on a self-serving mission \u2018save the world.\u2019","3.) Auditing \u2014 The rigor behind this operation is crazy. They have 5 separate teams of people for each stage in the transfer process \u2014 from initial outreach through final follow-up, the recipients almost never see the same people, so there\u2019s no nepotism, and absolutely everything is audited.","4.) Let\u2019s face it \u2014 \u2018data\u2019 is boring and unsexy, yet it\u2019s likely the most powerful foundation for any for-profit or charitable organization to build upon. GiveDirectly is almost annoying with how data-centric they are. Every decision, literally every single question we asked them about why they do or do not do something, was backed by data. And we\u2019re not talking about just any old data. We\u2019re talking about peer-reviewed, audited, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) \u2014 the holy grail of \"I\u2019m right and you\u2019re wrong.\" Not that they carry that swagger on their shoulder whatsoever (I\u2019m humble-bragging on their behalf), but if they\u2019re doing something, it\u2019s because their data, and 3 other independent sources\u2019 data has proven that\u2019s the right decision.","5.) The \u2018mission\u2019 per se of how GD gives isn\u2019t about funding what they believe will have the most \u2018profitable\u2019 result, rather, funding is based on who has the greatest need. Basically it\u2019s the ultimate \"anti\" ruthless capitalism. I loved hearing that. (i.e. not favoring a 22 year old with a bunch of entrepreneurial ideas over a 35 y\/o single mother of 4)","Richard Aura Ongari from Homa Bay, Kenya sits inside of the small two-room mud hut that he build with part of his cash transfer from GiveDirectly. The majority of his transfer has been spent on medication for a chronic illness. Before being able to afford the medication, Richard could not walk, but now that he\u2019s being treated, you can find him marching all around his property and enjoying his life with his children and grandchildren.","Now, for the meat of it \u2014 we went into small Kenyan villages and met these people who\u2019ve taken a cash transfer of $1,000 (3 installments over a year). Here\u2019s the breakdown of how their money was spent:","1.) Housing \u2014 everyone that we met improved their housing situation in some way; they were fixing the following core issues; (and FYI we didn\u2019t see a single home that was larger than 20 feet by 20 feet (That size home would house 5\u20139 people))","This small mud shack is home to 5. Before receiving his $1,000 transfer from GiveDirectly, Samwel Odhimbo Orimba and his family lived homeless on the shores of Lake Victoria in Homa Bay, Kenya. This house, where you can see through the walls, is a major upgrade for this incredibly grateful and loving family.","a. Thatched roof \u2014 which leaks in every rain and must be replaced every 1\u20133 years.","i. Completely sleepless nights (who can sleep getting rained on?)","ii. Leads to frequent illness \/ sometimes chronic, and death","iii. Leads to missed frequently school for children","iv. Leads to missed work and income","b. No home \u2014 living with 4\u20138 people in a 10x12 one or two room mud hut","c. Upgrading home \u2014 living in a mud hut (with holes in the walls)","d. Dirt floor in home \u2014 constant insect infestation, including \"jigas\" which burrow in your feet causing crippling pain.","2.) School Fees \u2014 After primary school, Kenyans have to pay $60-$70 per 3-month semester for school, given that people in extreme poverty often earn less than $5 a day for a family of 2\u20134 kids, that meager amount can be a mountain, forcing thousands of kids to miss out on school from 5 or 6 years old and onwards.","3 children of GiveDirectly Recipient Eunice Awino Omondi, and 5 of their friends all living in Siaya Kenya (Where President Obama\u2019s Grandmother lives!). Eunice\u2019s children are now much healthier because they can sleep through the night under a steel roof, and not thatched grass that keeps them up and cold when it rains.","3.) Food \u2014 probably the saddest of expenditures, in my opinion, but a lot of people that we met were purchasing a few month\u2019s worth of corn to feed their families. I see it as the saddest because such a basic need, that\u2019s consumed and gone without perpetual benefits","Bags of corn purchased with a portion of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly that sit in the recipients doorway \/ living room \/ foyer \/ children's\u2019 bedroom \/ guest\u2019s bedroom","4.) Other \u2014 Outside of those top three, which everyone seemed to have spent at least some portion of their transfer on, people purchased medicines for chronic illness (Cancer, HIV, etc), livestock for income, and clothing & shoes.","5.) I\u2019ll hide this little gem in here: Many skeptics think that large portions of the transfers will be wasted on vices like alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, or that the sudden influx of cash may increase a person\u2019s propensity to seek these substances, however there is no evidence that vice consumption is different from others in the community who did not receive transfers.","With GD\u2019s rigorous measurement and auditing, they find the effect on vice spending (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), is \"negative and insignificant,\" meaning there is no statistically significant effect on vice consumption...Here is the 3rd party study conducted by Princeton.edu","This finding is consistent with a publication from World Bank on vice spending and cash transfers that surveyed dozens of studies from around the world.","Now this ended up being a pretty diverse array of purchases considering that half were from one little village, and half from another, and for us it just highlights the variety of need that exists within any small community. I think that if an organization went in to build clean water wells, offered solar panels, mosquito nets, donate clothes, built schools or built houses \u2014 only a fraction of the gross value of the investment would be felt by the people in the community. Shoving a square peg of charity into a round hole of need. This is exactly why we believe in giving cash, and why we believe in GiveDirectly. Of course these people still have needs for more, but I can confidently say that 91% of what we give them goes directly to people who need it most, and 97% of that cash transfer served immediate needs in their lives, and I don\u2019t think other NGOs can say the same.","I think a more open and participatory conversation on eradicating extreme poverty is critical in this day and age. Extreme poverty sits at the bottom of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs and contributes to massive issues all the way up the pyramid; leading to widespread health epidemics, overpopulation, lack of education, lack of environmental and conservational awareness, increased violence and pollution. We\u2019re all connected, and the more people who live in dignity, the better off we can all be. Do you think cash transfers are a terrible idea? Do you know of a better way?"],"targetTitle":"Here\u2019s What Happens When You Give $1,000 to Someone in Extreme Poverty","targetDescription":"My wife, Adrienne, and I are long-time supporters of unconditional cash giving.

{"postId":"4z1mg1","postText":["British Police Officers Reveal What They Really Think About the War on Drugs"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["\ue605 A Met Police officer with some confiscated drugs. Photo: Tom Johnson","This post originally appeared on VICE UK.","Good Cop, Bad War is the story of an undercover police officer, Neil Woods, who spent over a decade infiltrating Britain's biggest drug gangs. The book , released last week, provides a unique insight into a world of mind games and violence, where the drug trade acts as a production line for the creation of ruthless gangsters. Ultimately, his experiences led Woods to reject the way drugs are policed in the UK.","\"The logic of the drugs war only leads one way: the police get smarter, so the criminals get nastier; things can only ever go from bad to worse, from savagery to savagery,\" says Woods. Now, after having left the force, he is chairman of LEAP UK (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition), a pro-drug legalization activist group consisting of ex-law enforcement officials.","But to what extent are Woods and his colleagues at LEAP UK\u2014and those currently employed in the police force\u2014rare specimens? How thin on the ground are drug cops who think they are fighting the wrong fight? Expressing sympathy for anything other than hardline prohibition\u2014even to their colleagues\u2014is something of a risk in the black and white, \"them and us\" world of police culture.","Even so, every now and then drug cops open up about the realities of clearing the streets of dealers and drugs.","\ue605 Neil Woods buying crack while undercover in 1995. Photo courtesy of Neil Woods","I spoke to Mike Fisher*, a senior drugs investigator for Britain's organized crime busting bureau, the National Crime Agency (NCA). He asked for his name to be changed to avoid disciplinary action, as his views will definitely not be found anywhere near the pages of the NCA's annual report.","\"If the NCA stopped targeting drug gangs, it would change nothing,\" he explained. \"You would see little change in the high street. Society would not collapse. As it is, drugs are freely available now. All that would happen is that dealing would be more open. But it may give us more of a chance to deal with crimes such as homicide.\"","On the surface, it's a counter-intuitive line to take for a senior officer working within an agency for which the drug trade is a key target.","\"Law enforcement against drugs is completely ineffective and has been since the Misuse of Drugs Act came into force in 1971,\" says Fisher. \"The idea of the state protecting you from yourself just doesn't work. We've spent billions of pounds trying to prohibit drugs, but there's less chance of it working than Canute stopping the waves.","\ue605 Photo: Andoni Lubaki","Fisher tells me that arresting people on the streets for drugs is an endless cycle, and that it's the same with the larger fish. \"Whenever we remove a big guy, someone else\u2014usually a lieutenant\u2014replaces him within days. The more we try, the harder it gets: increased enforcement keeps these people looking over their shoulder; they become more covert about their activity, and that makes our job harder.\"","Fisher's solution is to take the Portugal route: decriminalize personal use of all drugs, from cannabis to heroin, and look at legalizing production and supply. \"I believe consenting adults have a choice as to what they put in their bodies. It will also make it easier for heroin and crack users to get the help they need and free up police time to go out on patrol and deal with other crimes,\" he says. \"Ideally, production should be wrested from organized criminals and managed by governments.\"","Surprisingly, he tells me around half of Britain's elite drug detectives at NCA have similar \"liberal\" attitudes to the drugs problem.","But what about those drug cops working below NCA level, in towns and cities across the UK? To gauge what they truly think about their daily task, you need to be a fly on the wall\u2014so that's the exact position that University of Sheffield criminologist Dr. Matthew Bacon took. He spent two years embedded with drug detectives in a town and a major city (the identities of which are secret) in the UK and wrote about his experiences in Taking Care of Business , published last month.","Most officers were anti-drugs and fully supported prohibition. Drugs were seen as being behind all that's bad in society. This gave them a \"righteousness\" in their actions, observed Bacon. But within this, recreational drug users, social dealers, and nightclubs were far less of a crime problem than alcohol, a drug which few officers had a problem with.","It's perhaps not surprising, given the police's moral code, that most of the officers he hung around with viewed \"junkies\" as lazy, undeserving scumbags. In 2012, a former undercover officer who disguised himself as a heroin user-dealer, told me: \"It made me realize how bad cops can be to drug addicts. I was abused, assaulted, and threatened with being fitted up by having drugs planted on me on a regular basis.\"","To the anti-drug teams Bacon shadowed, heroin dealers were one of the most despised groups in society, so much so that they were seen as \"police property\"\u2014objects that police could do with as they wished. \"Almost without exception, dealers were depicted as deplorable and dangerous outlaws,\" says Bacon. \"They were made the scapegoat of the drug problem.\"","\ue605 Photo: Marco Tulio Valencia","Drug cops, who saw themselves as \"elite crime fighters,\" had sufficient respect however for the the Mr. Bigs of the drug world. They saw those who ran professional outfits and had families at home as worthy adversaries, and a \"good collar\" for which they would earn respect among their colleagues.","Despite all this, there was acceptance\u2014often expressed by officers off-duty after a few pints\u2014that they were not waging a \"war on drugs,\" but managing an unbeatable problem in order to \"keep the public happy.\"","One detective sergeant told Bacon: \"Sometimes I think we're like those [Japanese] soldiers in World War II\u2014you know, those ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over. Only difference is, we'd lost the war before we even started fighting.\" Another officer told him: \"We've thrown everything at it, even the kitchen sink, but drug problems just keep getting worse. In the end, the drugs are still on the streets, no matter how many people we lock up.\"","There are rebellious notions even among the rank and file. When I went stop and searching in Soho with one of the Met Police's sniffer dog teams in 2013, I was surprised to hear from a regular beat officer and his colleague that they thought cannabis should be legalized entirely. \"I say legalize the lot,\" one said. \"Legalize it and tax it,\" said the other. \"If someone wants to turn the sky green and the grass blue, then it's up to them. I can't see the difference between alcohol and cannabis. The official line is that drugs are under control, but they are not.\"","I call up Simon Kempton, a police sergeant from Dorset who has specialized in drug enforcement and sits on the National Board of the Police Federation, a body that represents rank and file officers. He agrees with Woods\u2014that the drug trade houses the most violent people in the country\u2014but believes prohibition is crucial to taking them out.","\"I can't speak for everyone, but in my opinion drug policing is worthwhile, all day, every day,\" he says. \"I get it: it can seem futile when we take out someone knocking out kilos of cocaine, [who's] replaced within two hours. But the reason it's worth doing is because the drug is not just about the drug trade: it's weapons, terrorism, people trafficking, money laundering; it straddles the spectrum of the most serious crimes, such as murder, kidnapping, serious assault\u2014which all go hand in hand with the drug trade.","\"We are taking out the worst people in our society. When they assault people it's not just a punch-up outside a pub; we are talking about sending a message through retribution and torture. These people have to protect their trade from others, so they use extreme levels of violence. You have to be the scariest, biggest person on the block, otherwise they will take your money from you.","\"Undercover police officers would not take the huge risks infiltrating gangs if they did not think it was worthwhile. Undercover drug policing is not cheap, but it's very cost effective. It's rare to get a not guilty after undercover work because of all the evidence that's been gathered. Yes, people can feel demoralized that they've put themselves on the line, and then someone ends up getting just a coupe of years, but that's the way it is sometimes.\"","However, Sgt Kempton said that for rank and file officers, policing cannabis was another matter, and that many officers sympathized with the path taken by Durham Police in going easy on low-level cannabis offenses : \"With dwindling resources, forces are having to focus their limited numbers on areas which represent the greatest harms to wider society. While policing cannabis is still a legitimate action, I believe most officers and the public would support a focus on other areas of crime.\"","Over the years writing about the drug trade, I've met drug cops who have told me that their job is similar to that of the drug user or trafficker\u2014a series of almost addictive drug bust \"hits\" that perpetuate the game. There are some who have crossed the line completely to become dependent drug users themselves, and others who are disgusted by the stigmatization of drug users and even dealers.","One female drug cop I spoke to told me: \"There are some pretty nasty pieces of work out there, but some of them are just ordinary people. Behind every user and runner, there's a story,\" she said. \"A lot of people say drug addicts and drug dealers are scum of the earth, but they don't know anything about them.\"","Woods' book will open the public's eyes to the raw violence and canniness of the drug world, and the lengths police will go to in order to disrupt it. But after years fighting at the apex of the drug war, his conclusion\u2014and that of other experienced officers who have chosen to speak out\u2014must be heeded if we want to find a solution to a problem that has been trashing communities around the world for decades."],"targetTitle":"British Police Officers Reveal What They Really Think About the War on Drugs","targetDescription":"\"Sometimes I think we're like those Japanese soldiers in WWII\u2014the ones on the island who just kept fighting because they didn't know the war was over.\"","targetKeywords":"drugs, war on drugs, good cop bad war, neil woods, Narcomania, Max Daly, post-regular, news-cycle, news, crime, drug use, drug dealers, drug gangs, arrests, cops, police, VICE UK, Good Cop, Bad War","targetMedia":["data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAMzMzP\/\/\/yH5BAAHAP8ALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/62f27bdd707fece1e17f8ae592aa45d9f3ce7741","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/973fcca06ce211fda31c16f10edc45938107321c","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/6bf69332854b92bf8dc89ca55748497d020e1a7f","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/b339c3f782f6875f34c781c0a8cb29e3b6c52848","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/ba18220d67ea21f9705acd66f2578e9d5238b3b1","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/4bf3918fde90c04032102bf2a49c64c94f45d14c\/scr.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/929ca28647309f2278330481aab2ce1ebeca0472","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/f6fe1180681774fe491bc303d7334a7c4722398c","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/a1236612a14ffb4c5b1f4be4d8dab457552dc08a","data:image\/png;base64,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","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAMAAAAoyzS7AAAAA1BMVEVMaXFNx9g6AAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEHAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/b664433987a80ba8a8dc941a740a61a7e5f7c5df","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/44fe84504b952902bc353ffc1a5d639356f3326e.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/575af6c93490090d6c82ae7bdf49899b9c4a578f","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/2949b83aa1d8998687db5a22494691d3f2b3173b","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/abc27b61515a6da9b226f2f2b597c8eaec3b2fe8","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/9ebe9b7ec3d663a5816dc45402bd441e872b5cfa","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/ddc84d91a0e5657ead0073c98070291ba56f8bd4","https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd\/0fe354f1cc3db115d4c7d046753c26407c9b221e"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/archive.is\/gxCxd","id":111}

And the birds can be damn cunning about it.","According to Seabirds: Feeding Ecology and Role in Marine Ecosystems, kleptoparasitism is a survival strategy that minimizes the energy expenditure needed to obtain food. Basically, the gulls have realized, why search for your own food when there's some perfectly good food in another animal's possession? They need to be clever to do so. Birds that are kleptoparasites tend to have bigger brains than birds that live the straight and narrow.","For it to be considered kleptoparasitism, the biologist Erika Iyengar explains , the parasite has to steal food from the host, and the host has to suffer as consequence. (The people who were not able to eat that delicious spiced chicken because, gross, a bird was in it, definitely suffered.)","And it's not just human food. Gulls and some other birds will steal food right from the clutches of other birds, mid-flight.","Seabirds breaks down the percentage of which species of seabirds get their food from robbing. There are some, like the Arctic skua (a.k.a. the parasitic jaeger), that feast primarily on the food of others.","Gulls are what's known as \"opportunistic kleptoparasites,\" meaning they don't derive 100 percent of their diets from heist but rather just steal when the opportunity arises.

The original title [of Stephen King's short story] was ... 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.' Now, don\u2019t choose 'Shawshank Redemption' when you\u2019ve got Rita Hayworth! But they said when I complained \u2014 and I did \u2014 that it won\u2019t fit on the marquee. So what? Just put 'Rita Hayworth...' You\u2019ve got the one-sheet there, it\u2019ll say the rest of it! But they chose not to, and so it took a while to catch on.","While the original title of Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption doesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is,","Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter than Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption end up getting cut off.","While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for Shawshank Redemption, making it one of the most popular films ever made.","Throughout his career, Morgan Freeman has been in a ton of incredible movies like Shawshank. In fact, his mere presence is enough to get most people excited about a movie, but did you know he was actually in one of the biggest flops of 2015? In fact, the movie made so little that almost no one even knows the film exists. Click over to the next page for the full story. As of this writing, The Shawshank Redemption is sitting atop the IMDB rankings of the most popular movies of all-time. The film is truly beloved today. However, that wasn\u2019t always the case. While the film was critically praised upon its release, it was a commercial failure. Nobody saw it in the theaters, and most fans found it on home video or cable later. Morgan Freeman thinks that a large part of the reason the movie did so badly at first is because the title is awful.Appearing on Late Night With Seth Meyers , Morgan Freeman says he knew thatwas a great film as soon as he read the script, and that he was willing to play any role just to be in it, but if there was one thing he could have changed about it, it was the title page.While the original title of Stephen King\u2019s novelladoesn\u2019t do any better job telling you anything about what the movie actually is, Morgan Freeman has a point that at least that version has the name of a famous movie actress included, which is something people will recognize. Shawshank, the name of the prison where the film takes place, is a meaningless word by itself. Morgan Freeman jokes in the interview that many people would mispronounce the word, even while telling him how much they loved the movie.Hearing that the reason the title was shortened was so that it could fit on theater marquees is almost quaint. Today, few theaters still have marquees that you can see without standing in front of the ticket window, and the amount of space given to each title is such that even titles much shorter thanend up getting cut off. Morgan Freeman makes a good point, that by doing the title his way, the part that you see has Rita Hayworth\u2019s name, which is something, although it\u2019s possible the studio was afraid people would think the theater was showing old movies.While we\u2019ll never know if the title change would have meant earlier financial success for The Shawshank Redemption we do know that the title they chose didn\u2019t help.

{"postId":"853858829934743552","postText":["How safe is your DNA?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA","CBS News correspondent Anne Marie Green writes about how she came across this story, and the Angie Dodge murder investigation, which she reported for \"48 Hours\" in \"The DNA of a Killer.\"","I first learned about the 20-year-old murder of Angie Dodge in a roundabout way, after getting my DNA analyzed by one of those commercial DNA databases. When I got my results back I was not surprised. There were no big revelations and, just as I suspected, I am not related to royalty. But I did wonder if I could learn anything more from the DNA report. That search sent me down a rabbit hole that lead me to the story of Michael Usry Jr., a young filmmaker who became a suspect in the Angie Dodge murder investigation.","After getting my DNA report I learned that there are a number of genealogy sites, educational institutions and companies that are willing to offer you further insight into what your DNA may reveal, as long as you\u2019re willing to upload your DNA profile to them. Some of these sites charge money, while others are simply willing to analyze your DNA profile in exchange for adding your profile to their database. I probably uploaded my profile to about four sites. One told me the type of workout supplements I should be taking, another searched public family trees for family connections. There was even one that promised to create a diet tailor made for me based on my DNA. I gave no thought to how my profile could be used by these companies or institutions down the road.","Then I heard that the New York City Police Department was trying to get permission to do something called a \"familial DNA\" search. What does that mean?  Police hunting for a killer in a high-profile murder case wanted to use his DNA to search New York State\u2019s criminal database for a relative of his. They had already searched for the killer, but he was not in the database. If they could find someone related to him they would have a family name, making it easier to track down the killer.  A quick search of the phrase \"familial DNA\" and I learned authorities in California had used it to apprehend a serial killer, who had eluded them for 25 years. The infamous \"Grim Sleeper,\" Lonny Franklin Jr., had a son who was serving time on a felony weapons charge, and his DNA had been uploaded to the California criminal database. A familial search connected father and son, allowing police to finally make an arrest.","A little more searching and I stumbled across a blog post about a young filmmaker named, Michael Usry Jr. A familial search conducted by Idaho Falls police landed Usry in a stark interrogation room, where he was grilled by detectives and asked for his DNA, without any explanation. I tracked Usry down on Facebook and asked him to call me. When we finally spoke, he told the whole story. How his father had participated in a genealogical study through their church, giving a sample of his DNA to a public database, which was later purchased by Ancestry.com. Years later, in an attempt to crack the 20-year-old cold-case murder of Angie Dodge, police conducted a familial DNA search in that very database, and found an anonymous donor who appeared to be a very close match to the killer\u2019s DNA. After obtaining a search warrant for Ancestry.com to reveal his name, detectives learned it was a man named Michael Usry Sr. When cops built out his family tree they found Usry had a son. Cops tracked him down and began investigating.","As I talked with Michael Usry, he told me he was very angry about being caught up in the investigation, but he was even angrier about something else. There was a man serving time for Angie\u2019s murder, Christopher Tapp, who Usry believes is innocent.","After I hung up the phone, I started researching Angie Dodge\u2019s murder and the case against Chris Tapp. I learned that authorities had never found Tapp\u2019s DNA at the crime scene. Tapp was convicted and had at that point served nearly 20 years because of his own words, a confession he made to police. I was immediately struck by the fact that Michael Usry Jr. and Chris Tapp had found themselves in similar situations, 20 years apart. Both men said they knew nothing about the murder of Angie Dodge , both men had their DNA tested and both men did not match that of the killer, yet one man went to prison and the other man went home. That was the story I pitched to \"48 Hours\" executive producer Susan Zirinsky.","Chris Tapp, serving time for the murder of Idaho teen Angie Dodge, shows CBS News correspondent Anne-Marie Green what his life is like inside the...","The day both Michael Usry and I went to see Chris Tapp in prison, I was struck by how soft spoken and kind Tapp was. He cried twice that day, once when I asked about the moment in his interrogation when he began to implicate himself in Angie\u2019s murder, and a second time when Michael Usry showed him a video of something that was shot for a documentary Usry is making about this case. It was an interview with Tapp\u2019s wife, Lori, who Tapp had met and married while in prison. In the video, Lori spoke of how much she admired her husband and believed in his innocence. The interview was conducted shortly before Lori was killed in a car crash, and this was the first time Tapp had heard her voice since the accident. I think there are many lessons in this case, but writing strictly as it relates to the privacy of DNA databases, the lesson is this: When you trade your DNA for information you are also giving it away -- and the database you give it to, owns it. What if that company goes out of business and sells the database? Do the protections you have been promised still stand? What if an insurance company wants to know if you carry a specific gene that could increase your chances of getting cancer, or indicates a penchant for risk taking?  ","Right now, the judicial system is playing catch up when it comes to your rights and protections, so we should all be aware and read the fine print. There is nothing wrong with wanting to know where you came from and what your genes can tell you about your health; just make sure you know what you are signing up for. Despite what happened, Michael Usry\u2019s father does not regret participating in a DNA study, but rest assured that his son never will."],"targetTitle":"How safe is your DNA?","targetDescription":"A new high-tech, controversial law enforcement procedure has some people worried it threatens the privacy of our DNA","targetKeywords":"48 hours, familial DNA, DNA test kit, privacy, christopher tapp, DNA database, DNA, Anne-Marie Green, the dna of a killer, Chris Tapp, murder, dna testing, Michael Usry, Angie Dodge, idaho falls","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":115}

{"postId":"4yx8ln","postText":["Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["I n the Superman comics there is a character called Bizarro, a twisted, villainous inversion of the iconic hero. Bizarro looks and acts like Superman but lives by the exact reverse logic: he says adjectives to mean their opposite, he sees it as a crime to do good, and so on. There\u2019s a great Seinfeld episode based on the character.","In today\u2019s age of superhero movie ubiquity, it\u2019s tempting to read 2000\u2019s Unbreakable as a Bizarro version of everything that proceeded it. The basic similarities are all there: a cloaked protagonist with superhuman strength locks horns with a scheming, criminally insane supervillain. We see the reluctant hero, played here by Bruce Willis, come to terms with his powers, use them for civic protection and watch him win the girl before finally overcoming his nemesis. We get both characters\u2019 origin stories in flashback, and both are played by Hollywood A-listers. It\u2019s the preeminent blockbuster blueprint.","And yet it by no means and exaggeration to say that Unbreakable is the exact antithesis of Marvel and DC\u2019s current output. For starters, it clocks in at 106 minutes and its cast barely extends beyond the four central actors. Nothing explodes, erupts or is shot at from beginning to end. There is no shouting. The film is shot and cut with a near-maddening degree of patience, its soundtrack almost noiseless for long spells, and it resorts to eye-catching CGI not once.","It may be anathema to the box-office behemoths of today, but there\u2019s no doubt that M Night Shyamalan\u2019s film is a superhero movie in the truest sense. Nor that, as its camera glides affectionately down the aisles of comic-book stores drinking in vintage illustrations, it shows a genuine passion for the original form that is unmatched by anything that has come since (with the possible exception of Sam Raimi\u2019s Spiderman films).","The present glut of cinematic universe-forging comic-book adaptations has born some decent films and some terrible ones, but none can claim to rival the atmosphere and immersion of Unbreakable. Remember the face-clawing tedium that was the final hour of Man of Steel ? Indestructible hero and indestructible villain throwing each other through brick walls ad nauseum, CGI skyscrapers reduced to CGI rubble at a rate of knots, the level of peril remaining at precisely zero throughout. Unbreakable\u2019s final encounter includes not a single building flattened, not a single punch thrown and lasts all of five minutes. Instead, we see Willis\u2019 David Dunn defeat his arch-nemesis by dobbing him in to the authorities. It is a scene of understated gravitas, perhaps the most affecting showdown of any modern superhero movie.","It\u2019s also significant that the other character at the heart of Unbreakable is Samuel L Jackson\u2019s villain. Six years before he was being driven to high-pitched distraction by those muthafuckin\u2019 snakes on that muthafuckin\u2019 plane, Hollywood\u2019s keenest scenery-stealer took to the screen with uncharacteristic restraint as embittered comic-art dealer Elijah Price, barely raising his voice above a murmur throughout (and his one concession to theatricality, the berating of a customer intending on buying a limited edition print for his kid, works as a nice metaphor for how the film wants to treats its audience like adults).","If Heath Ledger\u2019s Joker was so arresting because of his lack of motive, Jackson\u2019s cane-clutching baddie chills precisely because his are so plainly stated. But while Ledger used a manic physicality to unnerve, Jackson achieves the same end through the opposite means: his resolutely undemonstrative \"Mr Glass\" is straight from the John Doe school of dead-calm supervillainy. The scene where he repeatedly sabotages a book store clerk\u2019s attempts to wheel him out of the shop is a more effective, more affecting demonstration of directionless rage than any of the extravagant acts of terrorism enacted by his screen successors.","While today\u2019s superhero movies aim for excitement via loud action and bloated narratives, Unbreakable is deadly quiet, only lightly dusted with plot and told with an everyday realism that verges on mundanity. Its sole fight sequence is unpleasant and ungainly, actively un-thrilling, shot from a distance in one unbroken take. Admittedly the film\u2019s slow pacing can seem a bit strained at times, but it\u2019s a directorial style that takes guts to pull off this effectively \u2013 and one that\u2019s aged well over a 16-year period in which frenzied spectacle has become the new normal.","Two years after Unbreakable was released, Raimi\u2019s first Spider-Man film became the highest grossing film of that year, taking close to half a billion dollars worldwide and effectively igniting the superhero movie boom. A decade on, Marvel\u2019s list of past and prospective releases stands at 45, while DC having latterly leapt aboard the gravy train. Between them, these studios are working hard to ensure that the summer blockbuster season remains choc-a-bloc with superhero movies, a trend which shows no sign of letting up. \"These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn,\" Jackson tells Robin Wright\u2019s Audrey Dunn in Unbreakable. \"People are starting to lose hope.\" He didn\u2019t know the half of it.","Published 21 Aug 2016"],"targetTitle":"Why Unbreakable remains the ultimate superhero movie - Little White L...","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/826632c8c919a363a5d565b5ac80d3fb20d5c23b.jpg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/f7e02120b1a9a7be3480b8e3c64c372de911cec4.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/db12219cd0c0fa474288f8d970a53ab365ec3d8e.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/2ca12a003ba2a59eaa73e6535cbb94bf543e6a93.gif","data:image\/png;base64,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","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/1ec83eec7c5c0bc2a0a9302951ea04935a821221.gif","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/758e32443ba20b573effd1955aacd2eff5548d2a.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/7681e135e809ac8f9551e469a1f6b3cb272dc54b.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/04e4c94b5c8a4b878a05254ed1ce5d88bdd7bfac.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/81230d834f783fb41b691f536f8924d8ca008874.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/5991382db5636f1b796bbb5a6fdbd52608fc639f.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/1ab21373f5e4192ba5007f2d5a5973e736609950.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/1dd54d468af6c34af10c347ac5830188c19d19ec.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/0f774ba70f36292ec6e9d838a1debb8a7699f73c.gif","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/4aa495994deb51c4acb914601e8fa25ed6b05fe4.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/18057c7ff90d9e0c22110ee1510d6391750c67a6.gif","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/12d1f3ed0019ab17c3d47008876f3ac889ee8948.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/cfe2c135c2c54c1eaf04619f798e3b10e5728a5d\/scr.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/d0b67952f24359504ee12553d50a9d99cee43f6c.png","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/1744ae0412c17bb5266cc672ebd91b1548744372.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr\/0cf5bafd1bb3b51a77e40b35e789fb460e6a4980.jpg"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/archive.is\/m6cIr","id":118}

{"postId":"4rvo6c","postText":["Something Crazy is Happening in Switzerland, and its a Bad Sign for the World Economy"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Harold Cunningham\/Getty Images","Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition. You buy a bond. Then you get back interest payment. So easy, even your great uncle Mort can do it.","Jordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate\u2019s senior business and economics correspondent.","These days, things aren't so straightforward: The sovereign-debt markets have devolved into a bizarro world of upside-down expectations. Yields on government bonds from all around the world have been plunging thanks to anxious investors buying them for their safety. (Bond yields fall as prices rise.) And in many instances, the returns have cratered below zero. As Quartz reports Thursday, \"around a third of all developed-country government debt\u2014or more than $7 trillion, in terms of market value\u2014is now trading at negative yields,\" meaning that buyers are willing to pay more for these bonds than they will eventually get back if they hold them to maturity. This is remarkable. Countries like Germany have been selling short- and midterm debt at negative yields for a while, but now it\u2019s happening with bonds dated for 10 years or longer. Investors are basically banging down the door for the guarantee that they will only lose a little bit of money over the next decade or two.","The most mind-blowing example of this trend is Switzerland. Last week, yields on all of its government bonds, out to 50 years, turned negative. Investors are now expected to pay for the privilege of lending money to the Swiss for a half-century at a time. Other countries are getting nearly as good deals. Fifteen-year German and Japanese bond yields have also drifted below zero. Even economically wounded Spain can borrow for a few years at a time and theoretically make a profit. It's like a bad financial-world play on a Yakov Smirnoff joke: In Switzerland, lender pay you!","Why are investors settling for these kinds of terms? For one, they don't see many other safe options. The world economy still feels shaky, especially after the Brexit vote, which sent bond yields even lower. Meanwhile, stashing cash in a vault somewhere costs money and effort\u2014you need to cover the cost of security and storage. So they're willing to pay governments to essentially hold their euros or yen or Swiss francs. The fact that long-dated bonds are going negative also means that the markets don't expect inflation to rise much down the line, which means they don't expect world growth to pick up much either. It may even be a sign that some investors see deflation on the horizon, since a bond with a negative yield could theoretically be profitable if prices fall enough in a country.","All of which is to say: Today's sub-zero bond yields are a sign of how deeply pessimistic investors have become about both the near and somewhat distant future. And if they stay down, they could create some nasty problems of their own. When long-term interest rates fall too low, for instance, it makes it very hard for banks to earn a profit by borrowing and lending. This is playing out all over, but right now, people are looking very nervously at Italy's banks in particular, which are parched for profits while sitting on a pile of bad loans. As Matt O'Brien notes at the Washington Post, low bond yields around the world can make it hard for central banks to ever raise rates, since the second they do, investors will rush to buy that government's bonds. Among other things, that can push up the value of a currency, hurting exports and risking deflation."],"targetTitle":"Something Crazy Is Happening to Swiss Bonds, and It\u2019s a Sad Sign for the World Economy","targetDescription":"Investing in government debt used to be a boring, pretty straightforward proposition.

According to the report in Women's Wear Daily, we can expect more reasonable price tags on the racks at J. Crew as well.","\"For spring, you'll see our prices much more friendly this year,\" said Drexler. \"We can't compete with designers.

Crew stores. It's the \"middle of the road\" merchandise that will come down in price in some cases.","Perhaps they were persuaded to drop prices by customer complaints.

The Answer Is Actually TRAGIC"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Walt Disney may no longer be with us, but he's left behind a legacy of films that have ultimately been with most of us since the time we were born. For as long as I can remember, Disney films have been a major part of my life. Growing up, I constantly watched the classics with my family. Now, I find myself venturing off into some of Disney's newer films. But regardless of the year they are released, almost every Disney film has one thing in common \u2013 the main character almost never has a mother. But why?","Think about it!","Cinderella? No mom. The Little Mermaid? No mom. Pocahontas? No mom. ","Now some skeptics might point out that there are also a lot of characters who don't have any parents at all \u2013 like in Aladdin.","But even in those films, there are side characters who have a father and no mother. Recall Jasmine's dad the Sultan? No wifey.","Well if you've been trying to think of a reason behind this common plot structure, look no further.","Because longtime Disney producer Don Hahn recently offered two very insightful theories behind Walt's method.","And one theory behind it is quite sad!","Don explained that the lack of parents in the films is just an easy way to allow the main characters to grow up.","And let's face it \u2013 most Disney movies are about growing up. ","\"One reason is practical because the movies are 80 or 90 minutes long, and Disney films are about growing up\" says Hahn.","\"Bambi's mother gets killed, so he has to grow up. Belle only has a father, but he gets lost, so she has to step into that position. It's a story shorthand.\"","Hahn went on to explain that this isn't a method Disney created himself, but one that he borrowed from many of the fairy tales his movies were based on. ","But that's not the only possible reason for the lack of motherhood in his movies.","Hahn explained that the lack of mothers in his films might have been a result of something that happened to Walt and his family.

BuzzFeed News obtained the footage from the online-only Buffalo, New York\u2013based video store Cinema Cornucopia.","Other scenes from the film feature fully nude women posing in sexual positions, dancing naked, touching themselves while naked, touching each other sensually, rubbing honey on themselves, taking a bath, and dressing in costumes.","The VHS cover of the video reads: \"From luxuriating in a warm, soapy tub, to reveling at an exclusive night club, Carol and Darlene bare their sex appeal and lead you on a sensual journey of discovery.\"","On a bus tour hunt for the 2000 Playmate of the Year around the country, the Playmates travel to different cities including New York, Las Vegas, Chicago, Nashville, and San Diego. Trump welcomes the Playmates in New York and pops a bottle of champagne to kick off the New York stop.

Well, perhaps not always terror, but certainly mysterious lifeforms, as evidenced by a bizarre purple blob that appeared off the coast of California the other week.","Now, a new bemusing lump of biological matter has appeared near the shores of Bunbury, Western Australia, and it\u2019s safe to say that it caused some fishermen a bit of head-scratching. Smooth, pink, fleshy, and unbearably smelly, this chunky conundrum simply couldn\u2019t be identified \u2013 at least at first.","Mark Watkins, a fisherman of 21 years, had clearly never seen anything like it. \"When we got closer we realized it had to be a dead whale because of the smell,\" he told the West Australian. \"Its stomach was full of gas so it was all bloated up.\"","The stomachs of whales tend to be full of gas during life, but this is normally kept under control. Floating up to the surface some time after death, the Sun's rays began to hit the whale's abdomen, causing the gases to expand and ultimately forcing the stomach to swell up.

Console wars never change. The hardware arms race to superiority will forever dominate as the main motivation for any company not named Nintendo, or so it once seemed. Reports from around the game industry have dubbed a new iteration of the Playstation 4 the Playstation 4.5, or possibly Playstation 4K thanks to its upgraded GPU which will be used for 4K visuals and the fancy Playstation VR headset. The fact that the Playstation 4, which is still a relatively beefy system three years post-launch, needs an upgrade reeks of the days of gaming past, when kids had to walk uphill both ways to find an N64 ram pack so they could finally play co-op Perfect Dark.","Needless to say, pundits, hardcore gamers and industry leaders aren\u2019t impressed. Yes, technology is moving faster than ever, but had even a whiff of this been known back when Sony was the altruistic heroes of the Xbox DRM meltdown before the launch of the next-gen systems, most gamers may have saved up their cash for a gaming PC.","Speaking after Microsoft\u2019s Build 2016 keynote address, Xbox head Phil Spencer told Gamespot he doesn\u2019t believe in the piece by piece upgrading of systems, and you won\u2019t be seeing that with the Xbox One.","\"I\u2019m not a big fan of Xbox One and a half.

One in which gamers will intermittently upgrade their systems and won\u2019t have to shell out $500 every 5-7 years, thus rendering their previous console obsolete. If that\u2019s the case, it will be hard to take the first steps, but Sony could be trailblazing, and that\u2019s never easy to do with the gaming crowd.","(Via Gamespot)"],"targetTitle":"Xbox Boss Phil Spencer Says Xbox One Won\u2019t Get Playstation 4.5-Style Upgrades","targetDescription":"Reports say the \"Playstation 4.5\" is in development, but Xbox boss Phil Spencer says the Xbox One won't be receiving intermittent upgrades.","targetKeywords":"gammasquad, home page, technology, webculture, microsoft, playstation 4, playstation 4.5, sony, xbox, xbox one","targetMedia":["https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/bmw-feat-uproxx-1.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/analytics.twitter.com\/i\/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/150964.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","http:\/\/dbg52463.moatads.com?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8","http:\/\/t.co\/i\/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0","http:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/ryan-murphy.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/nodapl-wells-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/top-chef-feat-uproxx-2.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/weird-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/fastlane-header.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/xbox-one-and-a-half.jpg?quality=100&w=600","http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/photo\/95427\/profile","http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/content\/default-avatar.jpg","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/starter-jacket-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/photo\/101115\/thumb","http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/photo\/100821\/thumb","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif","http:\/\/d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/jeff-sessions-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/carl-ichan-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/future-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/sharp-dressed-man-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/xbox-one-and-a-half.jpg?quality=100&w=650","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/grohlsteen-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/spice-girls-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/ice-ramp-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/chef-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/netflix-theater-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/kevin-gates-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/sampha-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/uproxx.com\/gammasquad\/xbox-one-ps-4-5-upgrade\/","id":129}

The warehouse retailer\u2019s 16-year partnership with has expired, and as of June 20 members who had Costco AmEx cards should switch over to the new Costco Visa Anywhere card.","is now the only credit card accepted at Costco. (Debit cards, EBT cards, and cash are still accepted as payment too.) Costco members who have Costco AmEx accounts should have already been sent new Costco Visa cards in the mail automatically.","In many ways, the card change works to the benefit of Costco members. The new Visa cards provide members with 4% cash back on up to $7,000 of gas purchases annually, plus 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back for Costco purchases, and 1% back on everything else. The old Costco AmEx card, by comparison, gave 3% cash back on gas purchases up to $4,000 annually.","In the case of both of the new and old Costco-affiliated credit cards, the cash back can be redeemed only at Costco. What\u2019s more, Costco now accepts any Visa card, so you don\u2019t need to use the one the retailer sent as a replacement for the old AmEx card.","And there may be times when you probably should use a non-Costco Visa card for your Costco purchases. For instance, the Chase Freedom Visa card is offering an outstanding 5% cash back on purchases at warehouse clubs such as Costco, BJ\u2019s, and Sam\u2019s Club. The cash back applies to purchases up to $1,500 per quarter, and while the cash back offer was originally only supposed to apply to the second quarter of 2016, it\u2019s been extended to the entire year","So, looking ahead, Chase Freedom cardholders have the possibility of earning 5% cash back on up to $1,500 worth of Costco purchases (for a total of $75 back) during the third quarter (July 1 to September 30), and again during the fourth quarter (October 1 to December 31). After customers hit the cap, the bonus goes back to only 1%. Note that with the Chase Freedom card, the cash back is plain old cash back and does not have to be redeemed at Costco.","Finance","Costco"],"targetTitle":"Costco Is Making a Big Change Today That Shoppers Need to Know About ...","targetDescription":"From Yahoo Finance: How you can pay is changing.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/cecc225febbe519545f37f88354dee387928bb9d.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/150f4f22e022401ce1a7d9756a3add19026e66dc.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/21bf146cc84624895cab22711cd234f1e2b23e11","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/c49ff36109da5f0113555c92224d455aaab518ea.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/63a5155b8c1152795486ee50ee58632e711e2afb.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/ff6ef0ddebe8046c97aa05cdcc4133f6c5eb71cb.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/d38ee9fd38100245ec317c3cb7fce62233c353b6","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/d7e47b9b4da43a4131c7e44adbb7307bee6b08d4.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/7dbb4a35945151f2d4562ffd466f15e4c28903c1.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAABlBMVEX\/\/\/\/\/\/\/9VfPVsAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUCB1jYAAAAAIAAc\/INeUAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/9d030e8924125b95a647edf89032efdea1e9a54a.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/d9a72fb2fca078fbc2ae5a4a5701dc33a2e9f5de.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/3abe798e6e43c5da93e9034e54731c7a44267ff8.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/162eadf6c7f775a987e4d3001b40ed6dbb39caec.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/f649b07d0140808519a19fc8a3a85c94a1ded90b\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth\/97fc30c7f683cbe2790823527b2541709e280323.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/Knhth","id":130}

But, as he explains in the YouTube video above, online gaming eventually gave him a sense of purpose.","Worrall was on a windy construction site when his accident occurred. An incorrectly fastened air duct fell and hit a pair of two-by-fours; Worrall's helmet broke under the impact. He woke up able to move only his eyes. Blinking in a yes-or-no binary code was initially his sole form of communication. His father persuaded him to give it time.","Some time later, he was introduced to the Jouse, a mouth-operable mouse that made computer use accessible. Worrall began playing \"Diablo,\" and he was hooked.","Known online as \"No Hands Ken,\" Worrall streams his play live to a mass audience via Twitch. By placing the Jouse in in his mouth and puffing it, he is able to right-click; by \"sipping,\" he can left-click. According to a Reddit AMA he held after his story's release on YouTube, it took Worrall about a month to master gameplay with the Jouse. And now hundreds of thousands of people have seen him play.","Worrall never expected to catch people's attention -- or hearts -- in the way he has. When asked during his Reddit AMA how many people he expected to watch him, he wrote, \"Maybe thirty?...

Graphic images ahead that some readers might deem slightly NSFW, or for life.","This is Emma Quirk (center), a very lucky young Australian woman currently living in Alberta, Canada. ","Emma loves traveling, so a couple of weeks ago was exploring Saskatchewan, the part of Canada where her boyfriend grew up.","Saskatchewan is a province known for its beauty and particularly harsh winters.","Quirk said that after having a good deal to drink one night, she got separated from her friends with no phone, no money, and no sense of direction.","In the midst of the Canadian winter she found herself getting tired, a symptom of hypothermia, and fell asleep outside a nursing home.","Some staff members found her outside, and rushed her to the hospital. This photo was taken about 20 minutes after she was discovered, with her hands already exhibiting symptoms of frostbite.","She stayed in the hospital the next few days with people whom she described on Imgur as \"insanely cool nurses and doctors\" and even remarked at the coincidence that the specialist treating her was named Dr. Freezin.","The doctor explained the blistering process to her, and said he would pop her blisters when the time came.","Quirk, who works at a liquor store, described the agony of dealing with frostbitten fingers to BuzzFeed News.","\"The pain was so bad I could't sleep. The medication made me sick, and the prospect of losing your fingers never disappears. From the second I was told it lingered on my brain.\"","This was the biggest point her fingers reached in the process.","The doctor told her that the extent of her injuries ranged from mild to third- and fourth-degree frostbite.","The healing process was tough for her, but Quirk said it was little things that helped her maintain a positive outlook.","\"There would be these moments that pull everything back to a slightly better reality. Like trying to teach my boyfriend how to brush my hair, or getting him to do my makeup. And I think it was just a constant focus on the good bits that keeps me upbeat.\"","Quirk added that her hands have been healing well \u2014 she has a full range of motion, and most of the feeling in her fingers is back. Her prognosis is good, she said: \"By all accounts of medical professionals, my fingers are remaining attached!\"","She said she has a simple but effective philosophy on staying upbeat in the worst situations: \"Basically, try to find the shit that makes you happy, especially when everything seems miserable.\"","We'll try that.

The latter is largely connected to another phenomenon that \u2013 albeit prevalent for years \u2013 has been recently brought to the attention of the masses.","Yes, we\u2019re talking about whitewashing , a Yes, we\u2019re talking about, a casting practice that gives historically nonwhite character roles to white actors. Examples include Leonardo DiCaprio being cast as Persian poet Rumi , Tilda Swinton as Tibetan monk the Ancient One, and so on and on...","The latest addition to this troubling trend \u2013 the rumor that actress Jennifer Lawrence is being cast as Mulan in a Disney reboot.","The rumor was released by a fake (FAKE, PEOPLE!) @Unreel_News . It also followed with a \"breaking update\" that Hollywood\u2019s sugar boy Zac Effron will be joining Lawrence \"in the live-action Mulan remake as Li Shang!\"","The \"news\" quickly caused an outrage among many online users.

Evidently, people are concerned about the whitewashing trend sneaking into Disney and stealing what could potentially be a name-making role from diverse actors.","Even more worrying is the fact that bogus news like such are highly believable \u2013 and why wouldn\u2019t they be when we\u2019ve had white actors play everything from Asian to Black characters.","So what can we do to change that?

The U.S. also would need to cut carbon emissions 55 percent to 65 percent, according to the Stockholm Environment Institute, Friends of the Earth, and Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement for Debt and Development.","Worldwide, developed nations would have to pay more than $1.1 trillion annually to developing nations on top of massive emission reductions to keep climate change in check.","The environmental groups created an online tool showing how much each country should cut emissions and how much money should be given to developing countries not fully responsible for global warming but that would be devastated by climate change nonetheless. That even includes nations such as China, now the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter.","How did the environmental groups come up with such exact figures? The first scientific attempt to calculate each country\u2019s \"fair share\" factored in historical emissions, its wealth, and its current population.","That means poor, populous, undeveloped countries would be the beneficiaries of funds from rich, developed nations to cut their emissions and help produce access to energy for the 2 billion people living largely off the grid.","\"We call this a part of the climate debt owed to us, and it is needed if we are to confront climate change while still responding to the needs of people,\" Lidy Nacpil, director at Jubilee South Asia Pacific Movement on Debt and Development, said in a statement. \"It\u2019s not just a question of being fair. It\u2019s about being realistic. To be realistic means if we want a hope of stopping climate change, these transfers have to happen. These deep cuts have to happen. That\u2019s the realistic demand from people facing the full brutal force of climate change.\"","The tool\u2019s calculations are based on the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, which puts precise figures on emission cuts and money amounts needed to hold an increase in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2025.","Sivan Kartha, a senior scientist at Stockholm Environment Institute, said that IPCC\u2019s numbers show that temperature increases greater than 2 degrees could have irreversible effects on the world\u2019s climate.","\"Based on those limits on climate pollution for the whole world, it is striking just how quickly emissions need to come down, across the world. It may be hard to do, but it\u2019s dramatically easier than surviving 2, 3, 4 degrees of warming,\" Kartha said.","Kartha added that the online calculator shows not just what the whole world has to do to mitigate climate change but also helps answer the fundamental question in U.N. climate talks of what each country should do.","But how do we know all those billions transferred among nations would be put to good use and not squandered?","Alex Rafalowicz, a fellow at the Washington-based Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, said the creation of a transparent U.N. Green Climate Fund is paramount to the plan.","\"The organizing of democratic, accessible, and people-first financing systems is a core part of many organizations\u2019 demands,\" Rafalowicz wrote in an email. \"That\u2019s why they are focused on making sure the U.N.

To compare: When President Obama took office in 2009, the unemployment rate was at 7.8 percent.","With 14 total world championship medals, 19-year-old Simon Biles arrived in Rio already a star. It was her near-perfect performance at the Olympics, however \u2014 which netted four golds and a bronze \u2014 that cemented her legacy as the greatest female gymnast who ever lived.","No matter what team you root for, it was hard not celebrate alongside the Chicago Cubs after they won their first World Series in 108 years. As legend has it, the team was cursed in 1945 when tavern-owner William \"Billy Goat\" Sianis was kicked out of Game 4 of the Cubs' World Series game against the Detroit Tigers for bringing his smelly billy goat, Murphy. On his way out, Sianis is reputed to have declared, \"Them Cubs, they ain't gonna win no more,\" thus spawning the so-called Curse of the Billy Goat that lasted seven decades.","Several women of color made political history last month when they were elected to prominent leadership positions within their respective states. California Attorney General Kamala Harris became the first black woman elected to the U.S. Senate from the Golden State; Ilhan Omar became the first Somali-American lawmaker in the U.S. with her election to the Minnesota legislature; Catherine Cortez Masto became the first Latina senator in history when she won her U.S. Senate bid in Nevada; and Pramila Jayapal became the first Indian-American congresswoman with her victory in Washington state.","Few albums in history have managed to be as simultaneously vulnerable and powerful as \"Lemonade\" \u2014 Beyonce's sixth solo record that laid bare an important slice of black womanhood. Indeed, \"Lemonade\" was an artistic feat so monumental, it helped ease the pain inflicted by the deaths of some of music's greatest legends. But it wasn't the only great album of 2016: Frank Ocean, A Tribe Called Quest and Beyonce's own sister, Solange, also created stunning music this year.","For most people, any bad day can be made slightly brighter by the mere thought that \"Hamilton: An American Musical\" is out there and might, one day, be enjoyed by you again or for the very first time. In June, the hip-hip Broadway sensation took home 11 Tony Awards \u2014 including Best Musical, the biggest prize of all. But the most moving moment of the ceremony came when show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda delivered his emotional \"Love is love is love\" speech while accepting the award for Best Score. Hours earlier, a lone gunman had killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando.","President Obama made history in March when he became the first U.S. leader to visit Cuba in 88 years, culminating 15 months' worth of effort to reestablish diplomatic relations between the two countries. In addition to Obama's trip, Cuba and the U.S. have both taken steps since 2014 to end decades of hostility by opening embassies, restoring commercial flights and negotiating agreements on a range of issues \u2014 including the environment, law enforcement and communications.

As living things, humans are still evolving. Since we became Homo sapiens, has evolution changed us in any way? Actually, yes.","Thousands of genes have evolved recently (in the last 40,000 years). Changes we are seeing include smaller brains (more efficient, not dumber), resistance to diseases, increases in ADHD and blue eyes. Yes, blue eyes. Genetic analysis says the first blue-eyed human appeared 6,000-10,000 years ago somewhere in the Black Sea region. For whatever reason, the phenotype became very popular (conferring a 5% greater chance for reproduction) and today about half a billion blue-eyed folk exist.","Another famous example is HgbS (sickling hemoglobin), a gene that makes humans immune to malaria. Malaria is the number one killer of humans, so it makes sense that a mutation eventually arose that makes human red blood cells resistant to the malaria parasites, and for the gene to rise in frequency in malaria-prone populations (sub-Saharan Africa). Unfortunately, the same gene also causes sickle cell anemia. We all have two copies of every gene in our body (one from mom, one from dad), and if one copy is the malaria-resistant mutant HgbS, you're fine, but if both are the mutant, you get sickle cell disease. The good news is that many other genes confer resistance to malaria, and we are also seeing leprosy and tuberculosis resistance genes appearing, too.","Another example is the gene for lactose tolerance. Primitive man would drink milk as a baby, and then never again, so the amount of lactase enzyme (which breaks down a common sugar in milk) would fall after a few years of age. Over time, however, humans have evolved so that certain populations will keep producing the enzyme into late adulthood. As expected, the lactose-tolerant trait appears most often in the regions where dairy farming arose first and became an important part of the diet (Caucasians). Tolerance for milk is supposed to have evolved only 3,000-8,000 years ago, and is now found in nearly 95% of North Europeans.","Our mouths are changing, too. They are getting smaller and more bullet-shaped. Our teeth aren't quite changing as fast, which is why orthodontics and wisdom teeth removal still exist ... for now. More and more people are being born without wisdom teeth, or have their wisdom teeth erupt later if at all. Wisdom teeth were useful before knives and cooking, when humans would probably lose molars to chewing hard food and needed the wisdom teeth as replacements. Today, 35% of people lack wisdom teeth, although the genes involved in this are unknown so we aren't quite sure why this is happening yet.","Darwin's theory of natural selection evolves.","So what will we look like 100,000 years from now, assuming we still exist that far in the future? Even if we ignore new technologies, moving off the earth, and various selection pressures, evolution still holds surprises just by chance mutation. Ten thousand years ago nobody had blue eyes. Who can guess what evolution has in store for us ten thousand years hence?","This question originally appeared on Quora. Ask a question, get a great answer.

{"postId":"4kq3wk","postText":["Donald Trump takes poll lead over Hillary Clinton \u2013 is it time to panic?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["For the first time, Republican Donald Trump seems to have edged ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in presidential polling. But only just. What does it mean and should those opposed to Trump be worried?","The polling data site RealClearPolitics (RCP) takes an average of national polls that ask Americans who they would choose in a contest between the two candidates (a scenario that now looks inevitable). On Sunday, RCP updated their numbers to show that Trump is now, on average, 0.2 percentage points ahead of Clinton.","That gap might be narrow, but it has still led some (including a senior elections analyst at RCP) to conclude \"it\u2019s probably time to panic\". I\u2019d disagree. For those concerned about the prospect of a Trump victory, it\u2019s been time to panic for a while \u2013 zooming out from a single statistic shows it.","Delayed panic?","Although this might be the first time that Trump has come out on top in the RCP polling average, he has come very close to doing so on two prior occasions \u2013 in September and December of last year. Since September, Clinton\u2019s lead has fluctuated significantly from being as large as 11 percentage points to as narrow as 0.6. In other words, there have been many other periods when Trump\u2019s opponents should have been worrying before now.","Just as it took pundits a while to wake up to the fact that Trump was a sufficiently popular candidate to win the Republican nomination, it seems that they have also been slow to switch focus to his chances of winning the White House.","Part of the reason why they didn\u2019t panic before was a belief that measuring American public opinion a long time before a national election is a bad predictor of voting patterns. Why? Because people change their minds. November is still six months away. The alternative view is that preferences may be becoming hardened now, making voter behavior less likely to shift.","Looking backward, rather than forward, results from the last six presidential elections suggest that 31 states are \"safe\" \u2013 based on the fact that the same party has consistently won them. Unsurprisingly, polling companies are investing their time and resources in states they think might \"swing\" and therefore determine electoral outcomes nationally \u2013 states like Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia. So far, polling suggests neither candidate has a significant lead in those states which could provide extra cause for concern for those worrying about a Trump win.","Polling on a pedestal","All that said, the RCP polling average is not the perfect political barometer it is so often held up to be.","The polling average has become the go-to number for those trying to make quick sense of the state of the presidential race. That\u2019s problematic in itself; this election can\u2019t be predicted on the basis of just one number, not least because a candidate\u2019s vote share does not neatly translate to their chances of winning the White House. Each state wields a different number of electoral votes, so it matters how a candidate\u2019s support is distributed throughout the country.","Democratic victories in highly populous states, which have more electoral votes to award, could cause the performance of the Democratic candidate in the electoral college to outstrip her or his performance in the popular vote. In 2008, Barack Obama won 68% of the electoral college vote with only 53% of the popular vote. Clinton may be buoyed in the 2016 election cycle by traditional Democratic strength in populous states such as New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California.","There\u2019s another, much bigger problem with the RCP average, though: it\u2019s only as good as the individual polls that make it up. RCP always takes a straight average of the five most recent polls that were conducted. Once you peek under the hood, you\u2019ll see that an average of 0.2 percentage points flattens out some very different findings. These are the five latest polls RCP used to calculate Trump\u2019s narrow lead:","ABC News\/Washington Post: Trump leads by 2 percentage points","NBC News\/Wall Street Journal: Clinton leads by 3 percentage points","Rasmussen Reports: Trump leads by 5 percentage points","FOX News: Trump leads by 3 percentage points","CBS News\/New York Times: Clinton leads by 6 percentage points","These polls have different results in part because they use different methodologies for assessing public opinion. Although they were all conducted during a relatively similar period of time (which is essential when trying to get a snapshot of what the public thinks now), the polls by NBC\/WSJ and Fox News only spoke to registered voters, Rasmussen interviewed \"likely voters\", while the ABC News\/Washington Post poll simply spoke to adults (82% of whom were registered voters).","All polls claim to speak to a \"nationally representative\" sample of adults, but virtually none will publish data showing where their respondents were based. Perhaps Rasmussen Reports had to adjust their findings to account for the fact that they only managed to speak to two people in Iowa \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. Languages matter too. Two of the polls mentioned above conducted their interviews in Spanish and English \u2013 it seems that the others did not.","Methodologies matter. They\u2019re one reason why the footnotes in each poll mention slightly different degrees of accuracy. Take the ABC News\/Washington Post poll for example \u2013 those numbers have a margin of error of +\/- 3.5 percentage points. That means that Trump\u2019s reported lead of 2 percentage points could have actually been as high as 5.5 percentage points. Or it could be that Hillary Clinton actually led by 1.5 percentage points.","Polling is far from perfect. To understand what will happen when the country votes this November, pundits would do better to look at the electoral map, demographics and \u2013 most importantly of all \u2013 listen to the concerns of voters."],"targetTitle":"Donald Trump takes poll lead over Hillary Clinton \u2013 is it time to panic?","targetDescription":"The latest presidential polling average shows the Republican candidate ahead by 0.2 percentage points.

That is especially true of the relatively rare blue whale, the world\u2019s largest inhabitant.","Decimated by historic whaling practices, blue whales number just 5,000\u201312,000 individuals worldwide, and they are threatened by entanglement in fishing nets, environmental noise and pollution. Scientists have long used whale blubber as a record of the chemicals that these enormous creatures absorb as they traverse the ocean. But analysis of blubber does not indicate when chemical contamination occurred, or how long it lasted.","The whale earplug from a blue whale that was used in the study.","Whale earwax is a fat-rich deposit that stores the same chemical data as blubber. But it also records time \u2014 similarly to the rings of a tree, the wax is laid down in light and dark bands, with each band correlating roughly to a six-month period. In baleen, or filter-feeding, whales, earwax forms a solid plug that may be tens of centimetres long and remains intact even after its death.","Chemical signatures","Usenko and his team identified their specimen as a male aged about 12 years. During his brief life he came into contact with 16 persistent organic pollutants, including pesticides and flame retardants. Exposure to the most persistent chemicals was greatest in the first year \u2014 and accounted for one-fifth of his total lifetime contact \u2014 suggesting a transfer of contaminants from his mother in the womb and during nursing.","Maternal transfer of pollutants is known to happen in other mammals, such as seals and humans. Once these compounds enter the food chain, they are passed on and accumulate. \"Some of these chemicals are no longer in use, such as flame retardants that were outlawed in 2005, but they can stick around for 50 or 60 years,\" says Usenko. Other toxins uncovered from the earwax were probably picked up along the way. Mercury \u2014 which can cause brain damage \u2014 spiked twice in the sample, at around five and ten years.","Over the whale\u2019s life, concentrations of cortisol, a stress hormone, doubled. The peak was directly after the whale reached sexual maturity, at about ten years old, suggesting stress from sexual competition. But it is unclear whether the overall increase was caused by natural events, such as weaning, or by human activities, such as pollution and noise.","The research is \"exciting\", says Jeremy Goldbogen, a marine biologist at Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington, but \"the inability to distinguish baseline stress levels from those associated with anthropogenic disturbances is a limitation of the study.\"","The male blue whale whose earplug was harvested for the study. (Michelle Berman-Kowalewskic, Ph.D., Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, Santa Barbara, Calif.)","Usenko and his team are now hoping to investigate that question by analysing some of the 1,000 or more whale specimens in museums worldwide. \"If we can look at individuals that lived in an environment without some of the stresses we see now, then we could tease out the causes of the cortisol increase,\" he says.","This story originally appeared in Nature News."],"targetTitle":"Whale Ear Wax Reveals Animal's Exposure To Stress & Toxins, Scientists Say","targetDescription":"Wax inside a whale\u2019s ear stores all sorts of useful information on the animal\u2019s exposure to pollutants and stress levels throughout life, researchers ...","targetKeywords":"oceanography,biology,blue whales,blue whale,earth,whales,mammals,whale ear wax,whale earwax","targetMedia":["http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1357490\/thumbs\/o-BLUE-WHALE-EAR-WAX-570.jpg?6","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1357483\/thumbs\/o-WHALE-EAR-WAX-570.jpg?2","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1357427\/images\/o-BLUE-WHALE-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/230586\/slide_230586_2883569_free.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1em2S2Y","id":146}

{"postId":"389789613398564864","postText":["What Daniel Radcliffe thinks of the \"Harry Potter\" spinoff"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["There's little doubt that if Daniel Radcliffe were a rock musician, his current press tour for \"Kill Your Darlings\" would have a title like \"The Moving On Tour '13\" or \"Harry In The Rearview Mirror.\" Yes, Daniel Radcliffe is no longer Harry Potter -- as a recent New York Times Magazine profile deftly illustrated -- but what's interesting about Radcliffe (great, even) is that he's not anti-Harry Potter.","Here's your for instance: In \"Kill Your Darlings,\" Radcliffe plays a young Allen Ginsberg, who, at the outset of the Beat generation, finds his friend, Lucien Carr (Dane DeHaan), embroiled in a scandalous relationship that leads to tragedy. When I pointed out that the Ginsberg, wasn't exactly a connoisseur of mainstream tastes, Radcliffe defended the \"Harry Potter\" franchise. The 24-year-old may be moving on from Hogwarts, but he certainly hasn't forgotten, nor dismissed, where he came from.","Not only do you have \"Kill Your Darlings\" coming out this year, but you also starred in the Toronto International Film Festival debuts, \"Horns\" and \"The F Word.\" It's not easy to redefine yourself from Harry Potter, but it appears it's happening.","I think it depends on the attitude you take towards it, basically. If you say, yes, \"Potter\" was the biggest thing that I'm ever going to do and I'm never going to come close to that again, and it's going to hold me back from getting parts, then probably all of those things will come true. But if you take the attitude that this is the most amazing platform, in a way, to get set for a career in the world, it's an amazing start to have had and it's something that can be capitalized on rather than being something that holds you back. And I just have such fun doing my job, as well. Like, the most interesting way for me to do it is by picking diverse, varied things -- like \"The F Word\" and \"Kill Your Darlings.\"","And I think there's definitely an element of you grow up for 10 years on a set and you don't really have peers when you're 12 or 13 that you look to in other films. When you're 16 or 17, you start becoming aware of guys like Aaron Johnson or Eddie Redmayne or Ben Whishaw or James McAvoy. And you start being fans of them and you also start kind of going, \"Oh, I want to do what they're doing. I want to have loads of different parts as well.\" So it builds up this desire to get out there.","\"The Woman in Black\" felt like its narrative was basically, \"Here's Daniel Radcliffe's first post-Potter role,\" and now, with these, people have moved on.","I think that's a really astute observation. I think that's completely true. \"The Woman in Black\" was a fantastic transition because it wasn't so different than Harry that people were like, \"Oh, he's just trying to shock us.\" But it was different enough that people realized it was a different reason to go and see it. And the fact that it did so well and it was a really good movie. I may not be over the moon with my own performance in it -- there's still stuff I see when I see that that's very reminiscent of Harry. I only started filming it six weeks or something after we finished the last \"Potter.\" So, it came very soon after. But I do think, now, with these next three films, people will see it is so different from anything I've done before. I just think I've grown up a lot as an actor in the last couple of years. And I think, as a consequence, my work's gotten better and I'm just looking forward to people finally seeing it because I feel like I've been talking about this film for ages and now people will get to verify for themselves.","And you're playing a guy who is part of a group that despises mainstream tastes.","[Laughs] Yes. Yeah, I know what you mean. But, you know, I think that's what I liked about Potter and that's what I'm still very proud of about Potter. Even though it was the most commercial series in the world -- in terms of the money it made and the appeal it had -- we always did try to make them as challenging as possible. I think the reason I'm so proud of it, still, is that we made eight films that got better and better and better until the last one. That's not very often achieved in film and the fact we achieved it is a testament to the amount of care and love put into it by everyone who was involved on that set, all the time. So, yeah, I still think we did a remarkable thing and even if we were very mainstream -- which, of course, we were -- we brought a lot of integrity and sort of a boldness to the franchise. Because, when I was growing up, I don't remember people talking about franchises before I was in one. I remember people talking about \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Potter\" would be like \"franchises\" that's the first time I remember ...","Last time we spoke you mentioned you had never watched \"Star Wars.\"","Yes.","Well, except for \"The Phantom Menace.\"","Let's not tell anyone that.","You have to catch up before \"Episode VII\" comes out.","I know! I know I do. I have to catch up before that because fucking all of my friends are working on the new one. Because \"Star Wars\" is filming in Leavesden. There was at least one guy, Digby Milner, who worked on all the \"Potters\" who had also worked on \"Star Wars,\" the originals. And he will be working on new \"Star Wars\" at Leavesdon as well. And it is kind of amazing because \"Star Wars,\" the originals, were made in England as well. So there's a lot of that crew who we'll basically have a huge amount of sons and daughters of the original crew who are now on the new \"Star Wars\" movie.","It's come full circle.","That's all they do at Leavesdon, apparently, is franchises [laughs].","\"Kill Your Darlings\" is interesting because it involves famous people in a story that's really not that well known.","I mean, I didn't know the story at all. I really wasn't aware of it. That's one of the things that's so cool about it -- and cool about reading the script for the first time is you just go, \"Wow.\" When you have a story that is this fascinating about a group of characters that is this well known -- and, yet, this story has really never been told -- you start of just feel like this is buried treasure we've struck.","Allen Ginsberg wanted to write a book about this at one point and he was told not to.","Absolutely. Lucien, for reasons you understand when you see the film, did not want anyone to know this story. But I definitely think that was one of the fascinating things about it: people didn't know. And one of the things I think people will like about this film that I think, perhaps, they won't expect is that when you hear \"1940s Beat poet historical drama,\" you sort of think, Oh, that sounds quite dry. But it's actually a lot of fun as well. I don't think you can make a movie about the Beats without having fun -- because they had a great fucking time.","This might be a bad comparison, but it's got a superhero origin story feel to it, only with writers.","Oh, I've said that a lot.","Like when we're introduced to Jack Kerouac, it felt dramatic.","And the first time we see Allen's name in the film is on his university application. [Director] John Krokidas loved the idea of taking this famous person's name, but actually seeing it in the context of them applying to university.","What was your reaction when you heard J.K. Rowling was revisiting the \"Harry Potter\" universe with \"Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them\"? Were you surprised?","I had never heard her say \"no.\" I don't think any of us would ever be foolish enough to, you know, say never. But, I think with Jo, I wasn't really surprised. It kind of made sense to me actually, when it was announced. Because I was kind of like, \"OK, yeah, she's gone off and had 'Casual Vacancy' and then done the Robert Galbraith books -- and both have been very successful. And I imagine that has given her a confidence of, \"Oh, OK, now that I stepped away from it, I can actually go back to it with confidence.\" And I think she recognizes that there is still a huge hunger out there for more sides of the \"Potter\" world. And, yeah, she's wants to give people what they want. And I think it will be really good. I'm just relieved that it's in her hands, to be honest. That lets me know that it's not anyone just cashing in and it's going to be authentic.","She doesn't need the money.","She definitely doesn't need the money.","Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

Ideas Have Consequences by Richard Weaver","Originally published in 1948, Ideas Have Consequences foresaw the corrosive influences of moral and cultural relativism decades before the Left harnessed those forces to undermine Western civilization. One of America\u2019s greatest conservative intellectuals and an esteemed twentieth-century rhetorical scholar, Richard Weaver erected an intellectual fortress around Absolute Truth long before progressives mounted their frontal assault on notions of right versus wrong, good versus evil.","2. The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek","In the age of Bernie Sanders, today\u2019s young generation of would-be socialists would do well to read Friedrich Hayek\u2019s 1944 classic broadside against socialism, The Road to Serfdom. A member of the Austrian School of economics and a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, Hayek warned of the totalitarian realities of socialism\u2019s conceits. As he put it elsewhere: \"A claim for equality of material position can be met only by a government with totalitarian powers.\"","3. The Closing of the American Mind by Allan Bloom","Long before anti-MILO rioters sparked violence at UC Berkeley, a University of Chicago professor named Allan Bloom lit academia ablaze with this 1987 classic taking the professoriate to task for eroding higher education curriculum with progressive pablum. A staunch defender of the classical \"canon\" of great works every thinking person must read, Bloom explained how the intellectual corruption of the humanities and arts led to an erasure of students\u2019 understanding of the proper moral order that undergirds Western Civilization.","4. A Choice Not an Echo by Phyllis Schlafly","The late great matriarch of modern conservatism, Phyllis Schlafly, did more to advance and win the battle of ideas than many young conservatives understand. The tip of her intellectual spear, A Choice Not an Echo, reshaped the contours of American conservatism and has sold an astounding three million copies since its release over a half-century ago. The original anti-establishment crusader, Schlafly\u2019s book argued that conservatives must be willing to fight for a voice within the Republican Party\u2019s establishment leadership and helped pave a path for Barry Goldwater\u2019s nomination.","5. Capitalism and Freedom by Milton Friedman","Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman redefined the field of economics. In addition to being an intellectual titan, he was a sterling writer with a knack for distilling complex topics with wit and clarity. Any Nobel Prize winner who can string together a sentence like this deserves to be read: \"If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there\u2019d be a shortage of sand.\"","6. A Conflict of Visions by Thomas Sowell","There are no \"bad\" Thomas Sowell books, so we could have easily recommended many of his other classics. But A Conflict of Visions crystalizes the stakes involved in the clash between conservative and progressive ideologies\u2014and how radically different outcomes are when one side prevails over the other. One of America\u2019s most lucid conservative economists, Sowell\u2019s book draws upon everything from Rousseau to Hobbes to Adam Smith to illustrate the intellectual impulses that drive conservatives and progressives to think and act the way they do.","7. Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn","Hailed as one of the greatest nonfiction books of the twentieth century, Gulag Archipelago is the first-person account of Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn\u2019s eight years spent as a prisoner inside the Russian gulags for criticizing Stalin and the Soviet Communist system in his private letters.

However, there are some foods and drinks that may make it easier to get a great night\u2019s sleep.","Specific Foods That Can Affect Sleep","Researchers, including nutritionists and sleep experts, have conducted different types of studies to try to discover the best foods for sleep. While this research provides important clues, it\u2019s not conclusive. In general, there\u2019s a lack of direct evidence about specific foods that are good for sleep.","In addition, the range of varieties of cultivars of most foods means that their nutrient profile can be inconsistent. For example, some varieties of red grapes have high levels of melatonin while others have virtually none. Climate and growing conditions may further alter the nutrients in any particular food product.","That said, there are indications that certain foods can make you sleepy or promote better sleep. Sometimes this is based on a particular research study and in other cases on the underlying nutritional components of the food or drink.","Dietary choices affect more than just energy and sleepiness; they can play a major role in things like weight, cardiovascular health, and blood sugar levels just to name a few. For that reason, it\u2019s best to consult with a doctor or dietician before making significant changes to your daily diet. Doing so helps ensure that your food choices support not just your sleep but all of your other health priorities as well.","Kiwi","The kiwi or kiwifruit is a small, oval-shaped fruit popularly associated with New Zealand even though it is grown in numerous countries. There are both green and gold varieties, but green kiwis are produced in greater numbers.","Kiwifruit possess numerous vitamins and minerals, most notably vitamins C and E as well as potassium and folate.","Some research has found that eating kiwi can improve sleep. In a study, people who ate two kiwis one hour before bedtime found that they fell asleep faster, slept more, and had better sleep quality.","It is not known for sure why kiwis may help with sleep, but researchers believe that it could relate to their antioxidant properties, ability to address folate deficiencies, and\/or high concentration of serotonin.","Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice","As the name indicates, tart cherries have a distinct flavor from sweet cherries. Sometimes called sour cherries, these include cultivars like Richmond, Montmorency, and English morello. They may be sold whole or as a tart cherry juice.","Several studies have found sleep benefits for people who drink tart cherry juice. In one study, people who drank two one-cup servings of tart cherry juice per day were found to have more total sleep time and higher sleep efficiency.","These benefits may come from the fact that tart cherries have been found to have above-average concentrations of melatonin, which is a hormone that helps regulate circadian rhythm and promote healthy sleep. Tart cherries may also have an antioxidant effect that is conducive to sleep.","Malted Milk and Nighttime Milk","Malted milk is made by combining milk and a specially formulated powder that contains primarily wheat flour, malted wheat, and malted barley along with sugar and an assortment of vitamins. It is popularly known as Horlick\u2019s, the name of a popular brand of malted milk powder.","In the past, small studies found that malted milk before bed reduced sleep interruptions. The explanation for these benefits is uncertain but may have to do with the B and D vitamins in malted milk.","Milk itself contains melatonin, and some milk products are melatonin-enriched. When cows are milked at night, their milk has more melatonin, and this milk may be useful in providing a natural source of the sleep-producing hormone.","Fatty Fish","A research study found that fatty fish may be a good food for better sleep. The study over a period of months found that people who ate salmon three times per week had better overall sleep as well as improved daytime functioning.","Researchers believe that fatty fish may help sleep by providing a healthy dose of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, which are involved in the body\u2019s regulation of serotonin. This study focused particularly on fish consumption during winter months when vitamin D levels tend to be lower.","Nuts","Nuts like almonds, walnuts, pistachios, and cashews are often considered to be a good food for sleep. Though the exact amounts can vary, nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are essential to a range of bodily processes. In a clinical trial using supplements, it was found that a combination of melatonin, magnesium, and zinc helped older adults with insomnia get better sleep.","Rice","Studies of carbohydrate intake and sleep have had mixed results overall, but some evidence connects rice consumption with improved sleep.","A study of adults in Japan found that those who regularly ate rice reported better sleep than those who ate more bread or noodles. This study only identified an association and cannot demonstrate causality, but it supports prior research that showed that eating foods with a high glycemic index around four hours before bedtime helped with falling asleep.","At the same time, sugary beverages and sweets have been tied to worse sleep, so it appears that not all carbohydrates and high glycemic index foods are created equal. Additional research is necessary to fully identify the sleep-related effects of different carbohydrates.","The impact of carbohydrates on sleep may be influenced by what is consumed with them. For example, a combination of a moderate amount protein that has tryptophan, a sleep-promoting amino acid, and carbohydrates may make it easier for the tryptophan to reach the brain. Turkey is an example of a protein with high levels of tryptophan."],"targetTitle":"Eat These Foods for Better Sleep","targetDescription":"The Best Foods to Help You Sleep","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":"https:\/\/www.sleepfoundation.org\/nutrition\/food-and-drink-promote-good-nights-sleep","id":156}

Jillette ate only potatoes \u2013 in any form; mashed, baked, you name it, but NO other vegetables, fruits, or even other proteins. He didn\u2019t exercise, but did lose 75 lbs in three months, slowing adding more foods to his diet after several weeks.

'It's better to use a lighter, fresher foundation to make the skin look more natural,' he advises. 'Just use concealer where you need it.'","Stay away from pressed powders: Rupert King maintains that they create a heavier, dryer look to the skin. 'Instead, aim for a more dewy, moist look to the skin, it will help to soften those dryers areas where the fine lines can show up. If you still feel too shiny choose a micro fine loose powder and just apply to the centre of the face.'   ","Avoid nude lipsticks: Rupert believes this hue can make you look sallow and drained and women should choose colours with a fresher coral or peach undertone. ","Don't skip the moisturiser: Karla Powell, MUA and brand ambassador for MUA Cosmetics, says that applying make-up to un-moisturised dry skin can enhance your lines. So before applying your make-up pack on a rich moisturiser, which will leave your skin feeling nourished and smoother. ","Always do your brows: Brows tend to thin as we age, but having a structured brow can take years off of your face, instantly lifting and defining your eye area. Karla advises avoiding gels and pencils - which can leave brows looking too harsh and \u2018drawn on\u2019 - and opt for a powder formula, which will give a much more natural finish. 'Never go too dark as this can age you, aim to choose only a shade or two darker than your hair colour,' she adds.","Stop using a heavy coverage foundation","Stay away from pressed powders ","Avoid nude lipsticks","Don't skip the moisturiser","Always do your brows with powder","Don't apply blush to the apples of your cheeks","Avoid dark eyes ","Beware of the blush: Denise Rabor, international makeup artist and founder of Wow Beauty, says many people believe you should apply blusher to the apples of your cheeks, which is incorrect as this can draw your face downwards.","'You should actually brush blusher sparingly from your ear to halfway across your cheekbone, which will make your face look slimmer,' he said. ","Avoid dark eyes: Celebrity facialist and makeup artist, Nathalie Eleni, says that dark kohl under the eye can look harsh if not blended so opt for a softer shadow and blend along for a softer finish.","Apply under-eye cream correctly: Eva Alexandrides, managing director and co-founder of 111Skin, explains that the skin underneath the eye is a different structure to the rest of the face and thus is a lot more sensitive. 'Rubbing and pulling at the skin as you apply the cream is a real no go and will make the bags appear worse and more visible.","'Use your ring or little finger when applying cream whilst only dabbing, tapping or softly massaging the area with sweeping strokes. Finally, give it about a minute or longer to absorb before you put any make up on top of it which will prevent any \"caking\" around the area.'"],"targetTitle":"Is your makeup adding years to your face?

But which state can actually make that claim? A recent study conducted by Insure.com surveyed 2,000 drivers from across the country to determine once and for all which state has the rudest drivers of them all. And the results will surprise you.","It's logical to think that states with notoriously bad traffic would produce some of the nation's rudest commuters, and while states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia fall in the top 10, the state with the absolute rudest drivers is tucked away in the Rocky Mountains: Idaho.","(MORE: 10 Cities With the Worst Drivers)","The survey concluded that Idaho is made up of two main types of drivers -- \"those who are moving so slowly that they're judged to be rude, and the aggressive drivers who speed around them and flip them off.\" The imperfect marriage of these two driving types propels the Gem State to the top of the list.","One responder took a stab at explaining the strange dichotomy happening in the Northwest. Eric Leins of Southern California posited that Idaho's rural and mountainous terrain was to blame. He argued that residents and seasoned drivers are familiar with the twists and turns and lack the patience for those who are navigating the state's roads for the first time.

{"postId":"4r59nu","postText":["Are You Reading The Wrong Books? What Science Is Saying About Fiction Readers"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Will S.","For most, the love of books starts in childhood. For others, this love blooms later, eventually revealing the vibrant colors of a true bibliophile! But science has started looking into the effects of reading on the brain. They\u2019ve done experiments, ran MRIs, polled, and surveyed, all to what end? Studies have been released in the past several years that have given scientists some interesting data about fiction readers and what type of fiction they should read!","What has science concluded? Studies are showing that readers of fiction are more empathetic towards others. By engaging with a story, readers are temporarily placing themselves in a character\u2019s shoes, therefore, the more stories you read, the more shoes you\u2019ve tried on. It\u2019s a fascinating insight into the world of reading.","In 2012, Standford University did research into why this is. According to neuroscientist Bob Dougherty,","\"The right patterns of ink on a page can create vivid mental imagery and instill powerful emotions.\"","Your brain does amazing things while you\u2019re reading, the breadth of which researchers are still defining. And by placing yourself into the world of a great novel, you are given the chance to experience something new that could be informative in your interactions with other people.","This compassion was notably detected in children reading Harry Potter. Another experiment \"conducted three studies to test whether extended contact through reading the popular best-selling books of Harry Potter improves attitudes toward stigmatized groups (immigrants, homosexuals, refugees).\"","The conclusion of the study was that children who identified with Harry as a character reacted to his sympathy for marginalized groups (such as \"mudbloods\") by becoming more sympathetic towards similar groups in contemporary society (such as the LGBT and immigrant communities). But this was only shown after these connections were explicated to the children and only if they identified with Harry.","What does this all mean?","Sure, we create images in our heads of the stories we read \u2013we engage with language, we sympathize with the characters in our books\u2013 but besides Harry Potter, which books should we be reading to maximize these cognitive benefits?","The authors of another study, David Comer Kidd and Emanuele Castano, tackled this question, but also asserted that what you choose read is important! As Castano explained to Mic.com:","\"We believe that one critical difference between lit and pop fiction is the extent to which the characters are complex, ambiguous, difficult to get to know, etc. (in other words, human) versus stereotyped, simple...\"","Through their research, they found that readers of literary fiction receive more of the empathetic benefits of reading than those who read pop-fiction or non-fiction. The term \"literary fiction\" seems arbitrary, but Kidd and Castano explain that literary fiction merely denotes the level of complexity in stories and their characters (at least, that\u2019s what it means in the context of their study).","In 50 Shades Of Grey, for example, the characters are laid out. They react to each other and to their environment. By no means are these characters simple or easy, but they do not evoke the same complicated and uncanny feelings that one experiences with Nick Carraway as he narrates The Great Gatsby.","Reading in general helps with empathy, but literary reading amplifies this effect. By reading a challenging book, you\u2019re not only becoming a smarter person, you\u2019re also become more empathetic. Literature is not always easy, but by attempting to tackle harder books, we create new connections in our minds that we might not have otherwise.","Like opening a window to let fresh air into your home, literature opens up our minds to the myriad ideas that we wouldn\u2019t be able to experience on our own! So after you finish your magazine or paperback thriller, reflect on its contents. Take a moment to analyze the experiences depicted as if they were your own. And in choosing your next book, make it a tough one.","Your brain will thank you.","Which book inspires you the most?"],"targetTitle":"Are You Reading The Wrong Books?

{"postId":"50pr3j","postText":["Does your iq correlate with the rap music you listen to?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["So the other day, I was scrolling through my timeline and came across a tweet commenting on some of the trendier rappers in hip hop right now. The tweet, which I\u2019ll paraphrase, said that people who listen to rappers like Kodak Black, Migos, Young Thug, Future, Fetty Wap, and Lil Yachty are people who subsequently have low IQs. This isn\u2019t exactly an unfamiliar comment that can be found online. I\u2019ve seen tweets before that have told me that I\u2019m stupid for listening to more Fetty Wap songs than Tupac songs in the past year. I\u2019m not a real hip hop fan, apparently. There are a couple points I want to get to about these sorts of popular, conformist opinions.","First of all, the digital era and internet presence of hip hop has made the genre as inclusive a community as I\u2019ve ever seen it. Chance the Rapper made Free (Based Freestyles Mixtape) with Lil B. Mac Miller has a song with Chief Keef on his last album, GO:OD AM. Andre 3000 dropped a lengthy verse on \"Sixteen,\" a song off of Rick Ross\u2019 God Forgives, I Don\u2019t. What haven\u2019t 2 Chainz and Thugger not been featured on this decade? Rappers with completely different styles and interpretations of hip hop are frequently working together these days. Your favorite, thoughtful, wordy rapper could put out a song with your least favorite, struggle-bar spitting rapper. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it happens (unless it already has).","So if a rapper like Danny Brown wants to hop on the remix for SD\u2019s \"New World Order\" (as he did), does that mean that Danny Brown has a low IQ? Or even, does SD have a low IQ for rapping repetitive and simplistic lyrics in a sub-genre of rap (drill) that almost depends on recycling lyrics\/themes? The answer to both questions is no. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter if someone\u2019s favorite rapper is Kodak Black or Kendrick Lamar\u2014it doesn\u2019t in any way reflect someone\u2019s intelligence.","Now, I can\u2019t really speak on the actual IQ numbers of the people I know, but I can say with confidence that I know a lot of very intelligent people who like rappers who aren\u2019t considered lyrical rappers. My sister, who does have a gifted-level IQ, has become a big Future fan. One of my college roommates frequently listens to Migos, and he will be attending law school next fall. My girlfriend, who is an award-winning writer, and who could run laps around most people with her expert grasp of language, gets hype to Flocka like none other. My favorite hip hop project of the year (if I\u2019m not considering the force that is Death Grips\u2019 Bottomless Pit a rap album, which I\u2019m not) is Lil Yachty\u2019s Lil Boat mixtape, and I just graduated from my liberal arts college with departmental honors. And I think \"Minnesota (Remix),\" which ironically features Quavo of Migos and Young Thug, is one of the most fun hip hop songs I\u2019ve heard all year. People with any level of intelligence are free to like any kind of music they want to. What\u2019s wrong with putting Kodak Black\u2019s \"SKRT\" and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \"The Art of Peer Pressure\" on the same playlist?","In fact, there\u2019s nothing wrong with liking both Kodak Black and Kendrick Lamar. Speaking of Kendrick Lamar, I have a friend who told me once that Machine Gun Kelly was a better artist than Kendrick. Sure, I cringed and adamantly disagreed, but ultimately it didn\u2019t make a difference what I thought. It\u2019s never cool to make someone feel bad for what they like or love, even if the music they like might be unpopular, weird, or bad to you. It\u2019s twice as lame to post on social media how terrible certain rappers are (rappers who could care less about the opinions of fans who they aren\u2019t trying to attract anyway) and even worse to trash the innocent fans of these rappers.","There will always be pretentiousness when it comes to any kind of art. I\u2019m guilty of it as much as I\u2019m sure a lot of people are. But opinions on hip hop are subjective. It\u2019s important to be open-minded. There are so many unique sub-genres of rap that are waiting to be explored that may not rely on lyrics, poetry, or message as much as maybe the sound, vocal delivery, or overall aesthetic. There\u2019s a reason Common isn\u2019t ever requested at the bar. I don\u2019t hear A Tribe Called Quest during warmups for big basketball games. How does one dance to an Immortal Technique song?","Hip hop needs guys that make music with energy. Hip hop needs rappers who allow us to tune out their words and just feel their music. Hip hop fans don\u2019t need to feel pressured to only listen to music that is considered smart. Smart isn\u2019t everything, and just because a song is intellectually smart, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is enjoyable to listen to. People have different tastes. A person\u2019s music taste indicates nothing conclusive about a person\u2019s brain power. So stop hating, throw on some Lil Yachty, and don\u2019t be afraid to like it."],"targetTitle":"Does Your IQ Correlate With The Rap Music You Listen To? by @PaulDickerson18","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/0.gravatar.com\/avatar\/3fa8e9fff3c959d0aed8bae997cbb0a2?s=100&d=mm&r=g","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/collage-2017-03-02-100x100.jpg","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/mu-plugins\/synthesis\/library\/printfriendly\/images\/pf-icon.gif","http:\/\/d8g345wuhgd7e.cloudfront.net\/site\/images\/affiliate_338.jpg","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/fresh-100x100.jpg","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/Lupe-100x100.jpg","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/rapiq.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=135181043537800&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/iq.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/deadendhiphop.com\/title\/","id":163}

When the microglial cells detect that mark, they bond to the protein and destroy\u2013or prune\u2013the synapse.","This is how your brain makes the physical space for you to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more.","Have you ever felt like your brain is full? Maybe when starting a new job, or deep in a project. You\u2019re not sleeping enough, even though you\u2019re constantly taking in new information. Well, in a way, your brain actually is full.","When you learn lots of new things, your brain builds connections, but they\u2019re inefficient, ad hoc connections. Your brain needs to prune a lot of those connections away and build more streamlined, efficient pathways. It does that when we sleep."],"targetTitle":"Your Brain Has A \"Delete\" Button\u2013Here\u2019s How To Use It","targetDescription":"This is the fascinating way that your brain makes space to build new and stronger connections so you can learn more.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/0FlJhBX0-720.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/NufKGQCk-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/WgUNJNk7-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/nGhgsd6c-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/0AujF3eE-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/2Wlc17rm-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/qLspiD0x-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/k9mwTEiu-720.jpg","http:\/\/grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/gjincfastcoprod\/1\/H.24.4--NS\/0\/5658306","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/bSs8LSoT-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/Ueo2OnMv-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/VNEEd6i4-720.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=475240032660076&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/B6rAM8bK-720.jpg","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-805310h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/1DJKIkgP-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/li2TZxx9-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/HtRtg2Lz-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/DuxEbyBC-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/PBKSEANR-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/Ysn4lusn-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/4XHDQVHC-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/SNkitMne-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/eLZDZzII-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/AKXJPqjj-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/V4PZMVPL-720.jpg","https:\/\/fast-company-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/fc\/3059634-poster-p-2-your-most-productive-selfyour-brain-has-a-delete-button-heres-how-to-use-it.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/z8GzAiOE-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/oDolSsnB-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/kTTJyEaC-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/XLeuxV8t-720.jpg","http:\/\/content.jwplatform.com\/thumbs\/rVSSGo3O-720.jpg","https:\/\/fast-company-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1488301193\/fcweb\/rlomdo5ahydxevm2jqs5.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3059634\/your-most-productive-self\/your-brain-has-a-delete-button-heres-how-to-use-it","id":165}
{"postId":"4uai7m","postText":["What would happen if the Olympics banned Russia?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Imagine the most stereotypically Russian way an Olympic doping scandal could play out. Are you thinking sketchy FSB agents? Passing urine samples back and forth through a hole in a wall ... hidden behind a cabinet in a laboratory? And everything kinda sorta maybe ties back to Putin? Because then you\u2019d be absolutely right.","This morning, the Court of Arbitration for Sport made a ruling on Russia\u2019s cartoonish state-sponsored skullduggery, which has been going on since 2010: It upheld the International Association of Athletic Federations\u2019 ban on Russian track and field athletes in the Rio Olympics, whether there\u2019s hard evidence they were juicing or not. The International Olympics Committee is still making up its mind about that ban, but it\u2019s also still possible it will ban the country altogether\u2014a decision that would affect not just the medal counts in Rio, but the state of international athletics.","Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, builds models that forecast medal counts based on past performance, population, GDP, and other variables. In London, the Russians won four to 16 more medals than his models predicted\u2014meaning their wins were probably inflated by doping. And his numbers have been borne out: The Olympic committee has since reallocated 11 Russian medals from the London games.","If the Russians competed in Rio cleanly (or, as Noland says, \"no dirtier than average\"), his models suggest they\u2019re good for 66 or 67 medals. So how many more would he expect if doping went on unchecked? If they managed to nab 11 extra medals in London, when their doping program was still relatively new, you can bet they could get at least that number and then some. Noland figures the Russians would have come away with about 80 medals.","If the IOC does ban Russia, that\u2019s enough medals to throw any Olympic predictions seriously out of whack. And many of the medals that might have otherwise gone to Russian athletes would likely go to competitors from the US, as they did at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics that the Soviet Union boycotted: In the absence of the USSR, the US\u2019s total medal count skyrocketed to 174, and fell to 94 when the Soviets returned to the Olympics in 1988. \"For the Olympic movement, it\u2019s a huge deal,\" says David Wallechinsky, the President of the International Society of Olympic Historians. \"This isn\u2019t Tonga or Paraguay, it\u2019s one of three big medal winners.\"","For the average American Olympics viewer, the absence of Russian athletes might go unnoticed. Where it most certainly will be noticed, of course, is Russia. \"You cannot separate the Olympics from politics,\" says Wallechinsky. \"That\u2019s a myth. Russia is already saying this a Western plot.\" Countries have been banned from the Olympics before, but it\u2019s always been for overtly political reasons. Germany and Japan were not on the Olympic guest list for the 1948 Summer Olympics, South Africa was banned during the apartheid era, and Afghanistan was banned in 2000.","The potential Russian ban wouldn\u2019t be that much of a departure from those decisions, because Olympic athletes\u2019 doping is inherently political. \"If doping is done for the glory of the nation state, even if the athlete is doing it in secret with just an Internet connection and a PO box, it can take on an element of politics,\" says John Gleaves, co-director of the International Network of Humanistic Doping Research. And state-sponsored doping is the same, but, you know, more so.","One of the reasons that doping has remained such a problem at the Olympics is that the whole process is completely byzantine, and countries are left to police themselves. \"The anti-doping setup had led to a really lumpy enforcement,\" says Gleaves. \"How much anti-doping work can Kenya be expected to do when you look at its ranking in GDP?\" The Russian doping scandal puts a spotlight on a problem that was already systemic in international sports.","Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport\u2014and failed on all those accounts,\" says The Games: A Global History of the Olympics . He puts on his best John Goodman: \"\u2018I\u2019m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\" Which may very well drive the IOC to be a stickler for the sake of its integrity and credibility. \"The IOC is trying to hitch its wagon to environmental sustainability, wider participation in sport, sensible urban planning, and clean sport\u2014and failed on all those accounts,\" says David Goldblatt , author ofThe Games: A Global History of the Olympics. He puts on his best John Goodman: \"\u2018I\u2019m talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.'\"","And this scandal seems an appropriate place for the IOC to draw that line. Look at what happened to East German athletes in the 1970s. \"At the nadir, doping accounted for 17 percent of the medals won in women\u2019s competitions,\" says Noland. \"There was no informed consent. You now have high rates of birth defects amongst East German athletes. The stuff they gave them had incredible, multi-generational physiological damage. I regard this as really evil.\" Whether you think that doping is inherently bad or the future of athletic excellence, state-sponsored doping is not in the spirit of the games."],"targetTitle":"What Would Happen if the Olympics Banned Russia?","targetDescription":"Because the Olympics are always political, and state-sponsored doping sure is too.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/a0d35dcc1f144f724e533c02322ad2f1f84ed0db.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/8e2fba476fa12929c8e57044fd4224862cc659b8.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/6cb066f3cc322055fbc027674f9093504fe0841d.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/d80edde401b0404a95987e46c6ae800d6ddd686f.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/4450fbb86cdb5cc9b9cf12bb16399f3ae95ec19b.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/ce85099bf875533ca2a7a57869e643f88314dc50.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/0dabde7bde542821d340f80f75981c23f4a385b2.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/c4f66ffcaa2014b1c730fbf1b1bdd0c921ee39d9.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/a28dd3ac060157e2d7d11d047e8bee875d073742\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/dae257cd8abc7aa725392bbe6006c78f3601aea6.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/4f745675ee7f667b2fcc685e94b288330a1d21eb.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/c8728df74487f907230358a1b08ae1a1b25f9ed4.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/79a5c6689b557efb5f61308f3a145434bec6dea3.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/ebd66de2ae8b9ab064e7f62c12c4b4198ae86313.png","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/54600d504feaafcf6a9810f8f602532429a2c023.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/f12f9f28bfaeb4b412e823400d68f1c99664ccdd.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42\/113c05fcfb6492c0d9262e1042490ed0a494eec1.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/kvX42","id":166}

","Gone are the days when we would name our child John or Jane, in recent times there's been a general trend to more creative names, such as Wolf or Apple. ","Problems arise when she tells you what she's going to name her child, and you can't resist sharing all your opinions on why this is a good or bad decision. ","Hearing opinions from everyone else is stressful for mothers to be. It's easier to not ask about the name and just wait for her to announce it once the baby is born. ","I've found that all children seem to perfectly fit their names in time, even if it might sound a strange or unusual name at first.","3. Don't look shocked when you hear she's pregnant","This often happens with women I see who are also in high flying jobs. When they say they are pregnant, their friends and colleagues jaws drop open and they get things like 'But you're such a career woman' or 'I didn't think you were maternal'. ","People can be ambitious and be mums. It's not one or the other. Whether or not you've seen her maternal side doesn't mean she doesn't have one! ","And whether or not you think she fits into the classic mould of a 'maternal woman' doesn't mean she won't be a brilliant mother.","4. Don't tell her she's getting bigger (and bigger)","While seeing a friend's bump grow can be really exciting, don't comment on the size or shape. ","Many of the most clueless comments that annoy pregnant woman come from people subtly judging them for packing on pregnancy pounds. ","A pregnant woman is aware that she is growing so there's no need to be constantly reminding her that she's huge, big, or massive. Even if she's looking a large she doesn't need to hear it.","5. Don't tell her she's not big enough","Following on from the previous comment, it is also not nice to tell someone they look small or ask them, 'are you gaining enough weight?' ","You may think you're paying a mama-to-be a compliment when you say, 'You're so tiny' or 'I can barely see your belly!' but you may only be making her worry about the development and growth of her baby.","6. Don't congratulate her on social media","If someone tells you they're pregnant, they have chosen to tell you and not your friends, family and random followers on social media. ","The decision on when to announce a pregnancy is not up to you, therefore, don't instantly go to congratulate them on social media because you might share friends that they haven't told yet, or they simply might be keeping the news under wraps until they feel ready.","7. Don't act like she's sick","Although pregnancy is in a way a medical condition, pregnancy is not an illness. ","Pregnant woman can still have fun, go out, exercise and more, attend meetings, head departments and in today's day and age, where so many women are doing multiple things like running businesses, building extensions and becoming mothers, they last thing they want is to be treated differently. ","Every woman is different, some may have severe symptoms, some may find pregnancy a breeze, only they are aware of their limits and how much they can take. ","That said, pregnancy can make women tired so do offer her a seat on the tube.","8. Don't tell her labour horror stories","Whenever anyone's having a baby, others love to share stories of their own experiences of labour. ","But telling a pregnant woman about your two day labour that ended in emergency c-section and you losing half the blood in your body is not helpful. ","Labour is a process and the great news is that in today's world, with all our wonderful medical advances and pain control, most women get through it, and usually, once the baby arrives, memories of labour fade away. ","It is genuinely terrifying for a woman pregnant with her first child to hear labour horror stories, so don't share them.","9. Do tell her she's going to be just fine","Pregnancy can be a scary time for women. Their lives are about to change and many fear how they will think\/feel\/cope 'on the other side'. ","The bottom line is that all women try their best and most women, even those who worry they might not be natural mothers adapt once their children arrive. ","It might take some longer than others to take to motherhood, but that is understandable as there's a lot to take on as a mother in terms of looking after a baby, and juggling whatever it is they will have to juggle, whether that's other children, elderly relatives, high flying careers, evening courses, husbands and everything else. ","If you throw in fear of post-partum depression and then the very real experience of having post-partum depression, it's no wonder women feel overwhelmed and anxious about what lies ahead. ","But I've met thousands of mothers over the years and you know, they've nearly all been absolutely fine, grown into their new role admirably, coped well and become wonderful parents. This is what she needs to hear.

Rowling may be best known for writing one of the most successful children's book series of all time, but Harry Potter is not what she's most proud of.","In an essay for Gingerbread, an organization that supports single parents in the UK, Rowling -- who is the president of the organization -- says that being a single mom to daughter Jessica gives her the most pride.","\"I would say to any single parent currently feeling the weight of stereotype or stigmatization that I am prouder of my years as a single mother than of any other part of my life,\" she wrote. \"Yes, I got off benefits and wrote the first four Harry Potter books as a single mother, but nothing makes me prouder than what Jessica told me recently about the first five years of her life: \u2018I never knew we were poor. I just remember being happy.\u2019\"","Despite her fame and success, Rowling writes that the single parent stigma persisted.","\"There was still no escaping the Single Parent tag; it followed me to financial stability and fame just as it had clung to me in poverty and obscurity,\" she wrote. \"I became Single Parent Writes Award-Winning Children\u2019s Book\/Earns Record American Advance\/Gets Film Deal.\"","Rowling went on to say that she is working with Gingerbread to enact policy changes that will positively impact the lives of single parents and their children.","\"It\u2019s investment in single parent employment that will allow single parents to work their own way out of poverty and secure real savings from the welfare bill,\" she wrote. \"Nothing outlandish: affordable childcare, decent training, employers embracing flexible hours, and a long, hard look at low pay.\"","This isn't the first time Rowling, who is now remarried, has opened up about single parenthood. In 2011, Rowling appeared on the show \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" to learn more about her ancestry and discovered that several of her ancestors were single moms as well.","\"What I\u2019m very struck by is how many single mothers I\u2019m descended from in this line of the family.

[7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health]","U.S. states may differ on the details of their laws regarding possessing alcohol, adult supervision of drinking, or drinking at home, but all 50 states have maintained a minimum drinking age of 21 since at least 1988. The benefits of these laws, however, continue to be debated.","Advocates for lowering the minimum legal drinking age argue that the laws have not stopped teenagers from drinking, and in fact contribute to binge drinking behind closed doors and in places with no adult supervision. They also argue that the current laws haven't led to fewer traffic accidents caused by alcohol consumption.","However, the new review found that since the legal drinking age was set at 21, young people have been drinking less, and are less likely to get into traffic accidents.","In fact, the age 21 laws have saved up to 900 lives yearly on the road, according to estimates from the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration.","Teen drinking and driving rates have dropped by 54 percent over the last two decades, and the biggest declines were seen between 1982 and 1995, a period which included changes in the Federal law that pushed all states to increase their drinking age to 21.","During that period, the number of fatally-injured drunk drivers decreased by 57 percent among those ages 16 to 20, compared with 39 percent for those ages 21 to 24, and 9 percent for those older than 25.","Looking at whether setting the age at 21 has driven teenagers to drink more, researchers found that psychological and social studies on drinking motivations have not supported this idea.","On the other hand, many studies have found that a higher legal drinking age led to less alcohol consumption. In one of the most recent studies, researchers found that in 2011, 36 percent of college students said they'd engaged in binge drinking in the past two weeks, compared with 43 percent of students in 1988, the first year that the age 21 law was adopted by all states.","Researchers noted the age 21 law has had positive effects despite being sometimes disobeyed, and indifferently enforced. Instead of lowering drinking age, there should be in fact stricter enforcement of the law, they said.","\"Clinical trials have found that when college towns put more effort into enforcing the law \u2014 and advertise that fact to students \u2014 student drinking declines,\" DeJong said.","\"Some people assume that students are so hell-bent on drinking, nothing can stop them,\" DeJong said. \"But it really is the case that enforcement works.\""],"targetTitle":"Keeping Legal Drinking Age At 21 Saves 900 Lives Yearly: Study","targetDescription":"By Bahar Gholipour, Staff Writer \r\nPublished: 02\/24\/2014 07:07 AM EST on LiveScience\r\n\r\n Laws that maintain the legal drinking age at 21 save lives on...","targetKeywords":"keep legal drinking age 21 saves lives,drinking age 21,legal drinking age 21,legal drinking age 21 saves lives,keep legal drinking age 21","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1640812\/images\/o-DRINK-ALCOHOL-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1640812\/images\/n-DRINK-ALCOHOL-628x314.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1fz49mZ","id":171}

Some Steam users own hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of CS:GO skins.

Although the correction was very uniform across the items I sampled, most items have not continued to drop in value, and many have risen back to their pre-announcement price.

They are perfectly smooth and mild and custard-like, and they make everyone happy. This pie is not that pie. At least, not anymore.","This is that pie after it left home and learned some things. This is that pie come back with secrets and scars and stories to tell. It tastes familiar, like sugar pumpkins smoothed out with dairy and set with eggs, but it\u2019s more complex and delicious than ever.","Behold Sister Pie's delicious tahini-cardamom squash pie in all its glory. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard\/Bloomberg","The recipe (see below) comes from Lisa Ludwinski of Sister Pie in Detroit. She doesn\u2019t fear this year\u2019s looming canned pumpkin shortage because she makes the filling from a bunch of different winter squash, split and roasted in her bakery\u2019s kitchen. Between September and November, the mix changes depending on what\u2019s good, from delicata and butternut to buttercup and hubbard.","A little cream infused with floral cardamom pods loosens up the mixture, which Ludwinski pours over an almost jammy spread of cream cheese that\u2019s been blitzed with toasted walnuts and tahini, the peanut-butter-like paste made from sesame seeds. That thin layer of soft, pleasingly salty tahini-walnut spread is what makes this pie sing.","Lisa Ludwinski runs a team of 12 at Sister Pie, which in addition to pies also sells cookies, shortbread, and savory dishes like salads. Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard\/Bloomberg","\"There\u2019s a large Middle Eastern population in Detroit, and I\u2019ve been really influenced by the brightness of Middle Eastern flavors,\" Ludwinski said over the phone. \"Also I have a total obsessive love for tahini.\"","One of Michigan native Ludwinski\u2019s earliest memories is of her parents taking her to a Cinnabon and seeing the magic behind the scenes. \"I will always remember watching people put the cinnamon into the dough, the slicing and the icing,\" Ludwinski says. It\u2019s no coincidence that at Sister Pie she designed an open kitchen, too. Anyone walking in for a cup of coffee and some shortbread can see bakers scooping cookies, sealing hand pies with a fork, or rolling out dough by hand.","Sister Pie's counter is filled with other goodies, such as these freshly baked peanut butter cookies (spiked with paprika). Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard\/Bloomberg","Ludwinski moved to New York in 2006 to pursue a career in theater, but she was sidetracked by the food scene. At Momofuku's Milk Bar, where she worked for Christina Tosi, she developed a taste for low-moisture, high-fat Plugra butter, which Ludwinski now uses for all her doughs. \"You\u2019ve got to use it every time,\" she says, \"because the flavor is so different, and so clear.\" She picked up the habit of adding a splash of apple cider vinegar to the dough at Four & Twenty Blackbirds pie shop in Gowanus, Brooklyn, where Ludwinski spent a year making pies.

Photographers: Michelle & Chris Gerard\/Bloomberg","Method:","1. Prepare the pie dough: I\u200bn a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Using a pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until it\u2019s in coarse pieces about the size of peas. Add the ice water a tablespoon at a time and begin to gather the dough together with your hands. Pat the dough into a 1-inch-thick square and wrap in plastic to chill for a couple of hours in the fridge (or at least 30 minutes).","2. Roast the squash: While the crust is chilling, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, halve the squash and hollow out the seedy center with a spoon. Place squash cut sides up on a baking sheet and brush with butter. Bake for about one hour, or until the flesh is soft and cooked through. Once it's cooled, scoop out the flesh and add to a food processor with the pumpkin pure\u0301e and mix until smooth. (If the squash is very wet, place in a cheesecloth and press to get rid of any excess moisture.) Set aside.","3. Make the cardamom cream: I\u200bn a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring cream and cardamom to a gentle simmer. Turn off heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes. Strain and set aside to cool.","4. Mix the filling: I\u200bn a medium bowl, w\u200bhisk together light brown sugar, spices, cornmeal, and salt. In another bowl, mix eggs with cardamom cream, squash, and vanilla and whisk until smooth. Slowly pour egg mixture into sugar mixture and whisk until combined.","5. Prepare the pie crust: Flour your work surface and place the unwrapped dough in the center. Roll out, keeping it moving with your hands and throwing on more flour as needed to prevent sticking, until you have a disk of even thickness that\u2019s about 12 inches in diameter. Invert your pie tin or dish onto the circle, and cut a circle that is about 1 to 2 \u00adinches larger than the tin. Place the folded dough into the pie tin and gently press it in. Roll up the extra dough hanging over the edge toward the center of the pie, creating a ring of dough, then crimp it all around. Put the crust in the freezer for at least 15 minutes.","6. Blind bake the pie crust so that it holds its shape and is cooked through in the finished pie: P\u200breheat the oven to 425 degrees with a rack on the lowest level. Remove the pie crust from the freezer and place a square of aluminum foil over it. Fill with dried beans and place on baking sheet. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Cool for 6 minutes, then carefully remove foil and beans. Turn heat down to 325 degrees.","Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us. Get our weekly Pursuits newsletter.","7. Fill and finish the pie: Brush the crimped edges of pie crust with a little bit of egg wash, then spoon all of the tahini\u00ad-walnut paste onto the bottom of the crust and spread evenly (you can use your fingers to gently press it down). Pour the squash filling over the paste and carefully transfer back to oven. Bake pie for 40 minutes to 1 hour, until the edges are puffed up and the center is only slightly jiggly, then remove from oven and sprinkle lightly with sesame seeds. The pie should rest for at least 2 hours before slicing, and can also chill for a couple of hours in the fridge after it\u2019s cooled if you like to serve it cold.","Tejal Rao is the New York food critic for Bloomberg.

We're breaking up, we're not going on an 'extended hiatus.'","\"This is a really weird thing to say but we really do still love what we do. We don't love it any less.","\"We don't love making records any less. We don't love being onstage any less. And that's the hard part - you're making a choice to stop doing something you love which sounds insane to people.","\"But really what it's about is realizing that if you're a painter you don't just paint until you run out of paint. You don't just paint until your arm falls off. You make a decision at some time that you made a final brushstroke.","\"Or when you make a movie you don't just film until you run out of film or hard drive space, you make a decision artistically to say, 'Even if I'm having the best time ever, this is the end.'","\"So in the last few years we started to reach what felt like a thematic conclusion to our band, you know particularly Ben and I where we realized that in our lives psychologically that we were reaching sort of a resolve.","\"And that we had used our relationship with one another and our artistic outlet together in Dillinger Escape Plan to kind of work through a lot of things as people and as a couple of people. We started to reach this resolve - a thematic resolve - and it started to show itself in our music and our lyrics.","\"And I think we both just started to realize like, 'Hey, if we're ever going to draw a line and say this is over, this seems like a good time.' And we started talking about it and the fear aspect of it in a way, cause right away there was this gut feeling of, 'Oh shit, my safety net is being taken away.'","\"Once you got over that fear I think we started to realize that this feels like a very empowering move to say hey, now you can look at the Dillinger Escape Plan as a body, an artistic body, not just on an album-to-album basis, but you can look at the whole band artistically and say this is what this was. And it had a beginning and it had an end and they did close the circle and it is this thing that you can look at as a whole.","\"You know I don't like TV shows where they just go on and on and on until the ratings die. I like a movie where someone says hey this has an end and I made it and at the end I don't want to do another one. I don't want to see 'Pirates of the Caribbean 7' you know?","\"And I feel like once we started to wrap our brains around that we started to feel really comfortable about it.

The country is Samsung's home turf.","(Scurzuzu \/ Flickr)","Apple is massively known as one of the top purveyors of new innovations and advancements in technology. With the new patent filed by Apple recently, no one would not think what the Cupertino-giant is preparing in the pipeline.","Apple has filed lately a patent application with code US 20160264304 A1 for a paper bag. According to a report by The Telegraph, the patent is described as \"a bag container formed of white solid bleached sulfate paper with at least 60% post-consumer content.\"","The report stressed that this quirky innovation by Apple has already been in use around its stores across the globe and not too many noticed it until the patent came out. Apart from the patent being filed by Apple, the new paper bag innovation caught the attention of the tech community because of its support to environmental preservation.","Accordingly, this paper bag is made of 60% recycled materials. As Apple's application stated, \"The bag may be formed entirely of paper with the potential exception of adhesives for fixing together portions of the bag. This can help to reduce any environmental impact from production, use, and disposal of the bag.\"","It furthered that the bag container material can be suitably used for many times even after slight tearing. However, like the wireless earbuds Apple produced for the iPhone 7, the paper bag technology has drawn flak and sarcasm from netizens.","Meanwhile, the company has slowly been introducing efforts to improve current state of the environment. Earlier this year, Apple made public a robot called Liam to partake in recycling old iPhone units.

But is Linux getting to the point where it can take on Windows in PC gaming?","A writer at TechRadar remains quite skeptical about the possibility of Linux someday becoming the top gaming operating system for PCs.","Game Carey reports for TechRadar:","Evidently, Windows isn\u2019t going anywhere, with a Steam market share of nearly 96% as of March 2016. In fact, Epic Games even recently called Microsoft out on trying to \"monopolize\" PC gaming with its Universal Windows Platform initiatives. Although Microsoft has lost sight of what PC gamers want in recent years (see: Games for Windows Live), there\u2019s no doubt that the current Xbox head Phil Spencer wants to bring the company back to its roots, namely by integrating features (and games) from the Xbox One into Windows 10. In contrast, Valve\u2019s attempts at making Linux not only the best place to play games from your Steam library, but actually the heart of your living room are tough to jive with. Despite making an effort with SteamOS, it doesn\u2019t help that a number of companies still haven\u2019t released their November 2015-bound Steam Machines after neglecting to comply with the operating system\u2019s handicaps. There\u2019s a clear winner here, and unless Linux rectifies its performance disparity, lack of natively supported control options and impoverished game library, the OS to beat for PC gaming will remain Windows 10. More at TechRadar","DistroWatch reviews FreeBSD 10.3\u2019s new features","Jesse Smith at DistroWatch did a full review of FreeBSD 10.0 a while back, and now he has some thoughts to share about the new features that have been added to the recently released FreeBSD 10.3.","Jesse Smith reports for DistroWatch:","FreeBSD is a venerable operating system, often deployed on servers due to the project\u2019s focus on performance and stability. At the beginning of April the FreeBSD project released version 10.3 of their operating system. The release announcement for FreeBSD 10.3 mentioned several features and improvements which caught my attention. Specifically the availability of ZFS boot environments, 64-bit Linux compatibility and jail improvements were of interest to me. I was especially eager to try out FreeBSD\u2019s new jails technology using the iocage front-end. The iocage software has been presented as an improvement on (and replacement for) Warden, a friendly front-end for handling jail environments. One of the first things I wanted to do was experiment with boot environments. For those who have not used them before, a boot environment is basically a snapshot of our operating system. Before performing any major configuration change or software upgrade we can take a snapshot of the operating system. This gives us a point in time when we knew the operating system was working. We then perform any changes or upgrades we want. When we boot the system we can choose, from the boot menu, which snapshot we want to use. This allows us to effectively move backward in time and boot older copies of the system. This makes the operating system virtually bullet proof as almost any change (short of hardware failure) can be fixed by simply rebooting and selecting to boot an older copy of the operating system. The PC-BSD and openSUSE projects have used boot environments successfully for some time now, but the technology has not widely caught on elsewhere. The next item on my list of things to try was 64-bit Linux compatibility. FreeBSD has a compatibility layer which allows the operating system to run Linux executables. There are some restrictions though. For example, up until now the Linux executable had to be compiled for 32-bit systems and any dependencies had to be copied into place manually. There is a package in the FreeBSD repository which installs the CentOS core userland software. In essence, this gives us a bare bones installation of CentOS 6 in a directory on our FreeBSD computer. This is handy if we need to run Linux software alongside FreeBSD software or if we want to run Linux software without the resource overhead of a full featured virtual machine. The final feature I wanted to look at was FreeBSD jails, specifically the way the iocage software works and how it compares to the older Warden jail management software. Jails on FreeBSD are basically very lightweight virtual machines. Part of the file system is roped off and processes can run in this area (jail) without knowing about or being able to affect the rest of the system. What primarily separates jails from virtual machines is jails all share the host\u2019s kernel, meaning jailed processes must be able to run on our version of FreeBSD. In recent years Docker has provided similar functionality on Linux. More at DistroWatch","Linus Torvalds releases Linux kernel 4.6","Linus has been very busy working on the next release of the Linux kernel, and now Linux 4.6 has been released into the wild.","Simon Sharwood reports on what's new in Linux kernel 4.6 for The Register:","New this time around is support for a bunch more ARM systems-on-a-chip, including Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 820. IBM\u2019s POWER9 finds its first support, although perhaps prematurely given the silicon won\u2019t arrive until late 2016. Whatever CPU you use to run Linux, it can now have a more complex conversation about when to vary its frequency, OrangeFS, XFS, Btrfs and EXT 4 users can all look for tweaks that enhance performance of their preferred file systems, while F2FS is now said to be rather better at running on flash storage. Dell\u2019s laptops will play nicer with Linux thanks to driver changes that permit hotkeys to be pressed into service. Raspberry Pi users may appreciate new drivers that are said to do lovely things for 3D graphics performance. More at The Register","Did you miss a roundup?

Here\u2019s a more honest and accurate guide","An article has surfaced from the quagmire of bilge that is The Internet and it has caused, not without reason, a small tornado of outrage. Written as dating advice for \"The Modern Man\" (a misnomer if ever there were one), it promises a solution to the hot \u2018n\u2019 horny down-on-their-luck young bucks of the world who face the tedious obstacle of a woman wearing headphones, because how dare she. And no, it isn\u2019t a parody.","You can read it in its full entitled glory, or stick with me as I dissect each grubby, jaw-dropping delusion of psychopathic awfulness. It\u2019s going to be quite a ride.","How to Talk to a Woman Who is Wearing Headphones","\"These days, many women walk around playing with a smartphone or tablet device and are often wearing headphones and listening to music at the same time.","Yet, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t talk to them.","Of course, not all women are open to being approached because not all women are single and looking.","However, if a woman wearing headphones is single and hoping to meet a boyfriend (or even a new lover), she will almost always be happy to take off her headphones to give you an opportunity to create a spark with her.\"","The author, one Dan Bacon, could have saved us all a lot of bother here by answering his \"How to\" with \"Don\u2019t\". Sadly he seems to have missed some basic behavioural science here","you see, the very reason I and many other women wear headphones isn\u2019t as a trivial obstacle to some throbbing hormone mountain, nor as a challenge for those blessed with an abundance of ego. It\u2019s a defence. A defence against the aural onslaught of modern life and especially the leering advances of said throbbing hormone mountains. In short, we wear them because we don\u2019t want to be talked to. It\u2019s basic physics really - we fill our ear holes to stop you from getting in.","But back to Dan:","What to Do to Get Her Attention","1. Stand in front of her (with 1 to 1.5 meters between you).","2. Have a relaxed, easy-going smile.","3. Is she hasn\u2019t already looked up at you, simply get her attention with a wave of your hand. Wave your hand in her direct line of vision so she can\u2019t ignore it.","4. When she looks at you, smile and point to her headphones and say, \"Take off your headphones for a minute\" and pretend to be taking headphones off your head, so she fully understands.","If she doesn\u2019t understand (most women will), simply gesture that you want to talk to her by briefly pointing back and forth from you to her and say, \"I want to talk to you for a minute.\"","In most cases, you won\u2019t have to go to that extreme, but some girls are shy and will be hesitant to take the headphones off right away because they are feeling a lot of nervousness and excitement about what is happening.","5. Then, do what we call \"Acknowledging the Awkwardness\" by quickly mentioning something about the awkwardness of the moment (see the conversation example below), to demonstrate you understand that approaching a woman in this way isn\u2019t the most common of experiences for either party.","This helps put her at ease and know that you are a cool guy who she can relax and open up to.","I don\u2019t know if these five steps are a common \"thing\", but I have personally experienced this several times. At step 1 I know what you are doing and I\u2019m ignoring you, hoping the ground will open up and take one of us to the depths of somewhere Hellish, which would be more pleasant than this situation is developing to be. By step 3 I\u2019m not feeling \"excited\" and I\u2019m not feeling \"flattered\" as Dan later tells his readers I will be - I\u2019m feeling harassed. Straight up, dictionary definition harassed.","By step 4 I\u2019ve learnt that you can\u2019t understand a basic body language brush-off and are therefore a direct threat to my personal safety. My brain is in fight or flight, checking for escape routes, it\u2019s trying to figure out just how aggressively you\u2019re going to react to any further action I take to extract myself from a situation entirely not of my own making and it is praying they use a flattering photo of me on the news, not that one when my front-facing camera went off accidentally that time.","According to step 5, the fact you have bullied me into one of the most awkward and scary moments of my life makes you a \"cool guy\". Mr Bacon clearly has trouble spelling. It begins with a \u2018t\u2019, Dan.","Here\u2019s Dan\u2019s interpretation of how the conversation goes once a man has used his infallible five-point Jedi mind trick to bludgeon a woman from her blissful state of aural security:","You: [Smile in a friendly, confident manner] Hey \u2013 I know it\u2019s not normal for people to talk to someone with headphones in, but I was walking along and saw you and thought \u2013 wow, she\u2019s a cutie, I have to say hi. I\u2019m Dan, what\u2019s your name?","Woman: [Usually flattered by the compliment and impressed by your confidence to approach her like that] Jessica.","You: [Add in some humor] Cool...nice to meet you Jessica. I don\u2019t normally talk to girls with headphones, but your big green headphones were just calling out to me.","Woman: [Most likely laughing, smiling and enjoying the interaction].","You: [Let her know that you have something to do\/somewhere to go, so she understands that you\u2019re not going to stand there talking to her for 30 minutes] Anyway, so I\u2019m just out doing a bit of shopping at the moment. I\u2019m on my way to a store up the street. How\u2019s your day going so far?","In his scenario, Jessica has just been waiting her whole life to be blessed with the attention of a complete stranger who mistakes hunched shoulders, darting eyes and rictus for laughing and smiling.","Here\u2019s how it plays out in real life. Trust me, I\u2019ve been it, seen it and spoken to the survivors:","Him: I see you don\u2019t want to be talked to but I find you physically attractive and I\u2019m making that your problem.","Her: Please leave me alone.","Him: F*** YOU, YOU STUCK UP B****, I DIDN\u2019T FANCY YOU ANYWAY.","With \"advice\" like this out there, it\u2019s hardly any surprise, is it? These lonely men so desperately in search of conquests have been given permission, blessed with the entitlement to go forth and pluck their bounty using but five humble steps. So imagine their horror and indignation when that which has been promised doesn\u2019t want to be plucked and tells them to sling their greasy hook.","Next Dan lists the five mistakes men make when approaching a woman who is wearing headphones. Sadly not one of them is to sod right off.","Points 1, 4 and 5 are fairly inoffensive, generic dating guff (be confident, be engaging, be flirty), but oh boy, just try and get your noggin round points 2 and 3.","2. Allowing her to ignore him","\"Headphones are a great barrier between a person and the rest of the world.","That being said, if a guy wants to get a woman\u2019s attention he needs to show confidence by being determined to get her to stop listening to the music and chat to him to him.","If a guy has a weak vibe or presence about him, a woman usually won\u2019t give in to his request for her to remove the headphones.","Women love to test guys to see how confident they really are and a favorite test of women is to ignore a guy\u2019s attempts to converse with her and see what he will do next. Will he walk away in shame, or will he remain calm and continue talking to her in a confident, easy-going manner?","This is her way of gauging his interest in her and also a way of determining whether he is mentally and emotionally strong enough for a girl like her.","If a guy gives up at the first sign of resistance, most women will be turned off by his mental and emotional weakness as a man.\"","3. Allowing her to take control of the interaction","\"No matter how confident or challenging a woman might behave, she still dreams of meeting a guy who is more confident than her. A woman doesn\u2019t want to be forced to control an interaction with a guy (i.e. call the shots, boss him around), but she will if she has to.","Controlling an interaction with a woman is not about bossing her around, being arrogant or being too assertive. Instead, you simply need to assume the role of the man and let her be the woman. In other words, make her feel girly around you because you think, behave and feel (your vibe) so masculine.\"","The advice here is basically \"No doesn\u2019t mean no, it means keep going until you get what you want - the screaming will stop eventually\". Because apparently that\u2019s what women want - and forms the basis for a million rape defence cases. Trust me, when we tell you to go away we aren\u2019t testing your measure as a man, we\u2019re testing how quickly your legs can carry you in an offward direction.","Put Dan\u2019s advice into any other scenario for the true jaw-drop factor: \"Shopkeepers may lock their doors at night, but if you want a pint of milk, just hammer on the door until they open up. They\u2019ll be flattered.\"","I appreciate the world of mating is hard but please, for the love of humanity, learn this: just because you want, doesn\u2019t mean you can have. Women are not commodities to be hunted and won, and if you have no luck finding someone to bump pink bits with, that\u2019s your problem, not our fault for not adhering to the playbook rules. It\u2019s a playbook we never signed up for and it\u2019s only a game if both teams actually know they\u2019re playing.","Nowhere in his advice does Dan tell his frustrated man-babies how to handle rejection with grace, because the advice is simply not to accept it. This attitude is why I and countless other women have been been chased down the street, followed home, physically restrained, spat at, verbally abused and generally made to feel like garbage, merely for trying to exist.","So when, I hear the whiny pissbabies ask, when am I allowed to approach hot single women? Simple.","If a woman has her headphones in, the answer is never - and before you bleat on about \"ooh, what if there\u2019s a fire?\", she\u2019ll smell it, even through all your bulls**t. If you\u2019re in a bar or party, her flirtatious smile may be the come-on you\u2019re looking for, but be prepared to accept that you read it wrong, politely wish her a good evening and toddle back off out of her life without 20 minutes of awkward pawing, insisting she let you buy her a rohypnoltini. But how about this","take up a hobby, ask your friends if they know of someone looking to date or (brace yourself for a whopper of a revelation) if you\u2019re looking for a horde of single, eligible women all looking for friendship-maybe-more in one convenient place, try a dating site.","Anyway, coming soon from Dan Bacon, \u2018How To Talk To A Woman Through A Fog Of Pepper Spray\u2019. Probably."],"targetTitle":"How to actually talk to a woman wearing headphones","targetDescription":"The debate is on, and the internet at large has yet to reach a definitive answer.

Depending on the scope of the project, a single game can take hundreds of people several years to build. And with fickle markets and studios losing funding, even after a game is announced, there\u2019s still a chance it will be canceled like these promising games.","But some games capture the imaginations of gamers more than others, and sometimes those games seem like they\u2019ll never come out. Here are five games that have either been announced or strongly implied, games that people are chomping at the bit to play \u2014 games we\u2019ve been waiting on for a very long time.","5. Beyond Good & Evil 2","The original Beyond Good & Evil came out in 2003. It\u2019s a unique game that stars Jade, an investigative reporter who\u2019s working on a case about a planet-wide alien conspiracy. She can kick serious butt when the situation dictates, but she\u2019s also known to stop and photograph the fauna when she has a free moment.","The game was originally planned to be the first installment of a trilogy, but poor sales put a wrench in those gears. Still, the game was well-received by critics, and a cult fan base has been vocal enough that a sequel was announced in 2008. In the years since, an HD remake of the original came out in 2011, but we haven\u2019t heard much about the purported sequel. Is it still in the works? Will it really see the light of day? We may have a while more to wait before we know for sure.","When we might see it: Ubisoft maintains that this game is in development and will be released sometime this console generation. According to one rumor, it could be an NX exclusive.","4. Kingdom Hearts 3","For a certain segment of fans, the Kingdom Hearts games are a dream come true. They combine beloved Disney characters with fan favorites from Square Enix\u2019s Final Fantasy series. If you happen to fit into the target audience, chances are you\u2019re well aware of this long-running series.","The original Kingdom Hearts came out for PlayStation 2 in 2002 and has seen seven sequels in the interim. So it\u2019s kind of strange that the series hasn\u2019t managed to produce a third official installment, instead sticking to prequels, remakes, and \u2014 some would say \u2014 filler. Never fear. A third installment is on its way, and it\u2019s coming only to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. No release date has been set, but have faith that this one will actually happen.","When we might see it: Hopefully by 2017.","3. Final Fantasy XV","Fun fact: The game that\u2019s currently called Final Fantasy XV began under the title Final Fantasy XIII Versus, which was first shown to the public way back in 2006. Here we are closing in on a decade later, and this game still hasn\u2019t made it to market. What\u2019s going on?","Well, Final Fantasy, once the leading series of Japanese role-playing games, has fallen on somewhat hard times. The 13th installment in particular didn\u2019t exactly light the world on fire. In fact, most fans of the series would agree that it\u2019s been a slow downhill slide since Final Fantasy X came out in 2001.","Developer Square Enix is looking to fix that tarnished reputation by releasing a Big Important Game for the series\u2019 15th installment. And judging by the trailer and the demo that released alongside Final Fantasy Type-O HD, they\u2019re on the right track. Will the finished product live up to expectations? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.","When we might see it: November 29, 2016","2. The Last Guardian","Many longtime PlayStation gamers have a strong connection to the works of Team Ico. So far, the developer has only released two titles, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, but they\u2019re both singular, beautiful games that have made a lasting impression. The Last Guardian is Team Ico\u2019s next project, first announced with this trailer in 2009. The game was scheduled to come out in 2011, but it never made it to market.","Fans finally got a fresh look at the game at E3 2015, and some members of the press have even been able to play small chunks of it. Despite assurances that it\u2019ll launch in 2016, many fans are still skeptical.","When we might see it: Sometime in 2016... hopefully.","1. Half-Life 3","If there\u2019s one game more famous for not existing than The Last Guardian, it\u2019s Half-Life 3. If you haven\u2019t played the other Half-Life games, you might be wondering what the big deal is. First off, it\u2019s a terrific series of shooters that tells a great story. In fact, the series really laid the groundwork for all story-based shooters to come. It\u2019s no stretch to say that the original Half-Life was probably the first shooter to tell a story worth following at all.","Making matters worse, however, is that the last installment, Half-Life 2: Episode Two, which came out in 2007, ended on a major cliffhanger. But instead of continuing that series and playing off that story\u2019s big ol\u2019 hanging thread, Valve shifted its efforts to the (also excellent) Portal series. By now the demand for Half-Life 3 has reached such a fever pitch that even if Valve does eventually deliver the game, it couldn\u2019t possibly live up to expectations.

When the former First Lady, and wife of George W. Bush, appeared at last week's Women in the World summit, she outlined the qualities she thinks make a good presidential candidate. \"I want our next president\u2014whoever he or she might be\u2014to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue U.S. policies,\" Bush said. She added that the candidate should \"pay attention to our history, and know what's happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.\"","Though she was careful not to name names, some news outlets, including the Telegraph , have speculated that she was referring to Hillary Clinton who worked to improve lives of women in developing countries during her time as Secretary and State. Clinton also wrote a cover endorsement for We Are Afghan Women: Voices of Hope , Bush's recently published book.","The U.S. has a tendency \"to become sort of isolationist and xenophobic,\" Bush continued. \"I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated but we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.\"","Again the former First Lady did not specify any candidate.

{"postId":"4m1rq8","postText":["Is buying organic really worth it?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Buying organic food typically involves shelling out a premium. But is the extra pinch to the pocket actually worth it?","Last week, a Department of Agriculture report revealed just how much it really costs to shop organic.","Organic eggs, milk and salad greens can cost upwards of 60 percent more than conventional alternatives, while items like apples, carrots, granola and spinach carry premiums of between 7 and 30 percent, the study said.","Producing organic food tends to be costlier along every part of the supply chain -- including farming practices that usually require greater labor inputs and segregating organic ingredients from conventional ones.","Though there may be logical reasons for the heftier price tag, does it really make sense as a consumer to pay more for organic food?","The answer, it turns out, is anything but straightforward. Here, we explore this hotly contested issue.","What the heck does organic mean anyway?","Organic produce, according to the USDA, must be grown without synthetic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetically modified organisms. Organic meat has to come from animals that were raised in a natural setting, didn't receive any antibiotics or hormones, and were fed 100 percent organic feed.","\"By this general definition, [organic food] should be friendlier to the planet and pose less harm to human health,\" Chensheng Lu, an associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard University, told The Huffington Post over email.","When it comes to packaged foods, only a label that says \"100 percent organic\" indicates a product made solely with organic ingredients. \"Organic,\" on the other hand, means 95 percent of the ingredients are organic, while \"made with organic ingredients\" is reserved for products with at least 70 percent certified organic ingredients.","There\u2019s skepticism among consumers, however, about the trustworthiness of organic labels. Last year, a study by market research firm Mintel found that a majority of American consumers think organic labeling is merely an \"excuse to charge more.\"","Indeed, there\u2019s some evidence that organic labels may not always be reliable. A major issue, experts say, is a lack of a robust monitoring system to keep track of whether products that say they're organic really are.","Still, despite a flawed system, there do appear to be measurable differences between foods labeled organic and those that are not.","A 2012 meta-analysis published in the Annals of Internal Medicine comparing organic and conventional foods, for example, found that exposure to pesticide residue was more than five times higher in conventional produce. A 2014 study found that organic foods had significantly lower levels of toxic metals compared to conventional alternatives, and \"substantially higher\" levels of antioxidants.","So, what does this mean for human health?","According to the Environmental Working Group, nearly three-quarters of 7,000 produce samples tested by the USDA in 2014 contained pesticide residues. In some cases, these pesticides persisted on fruits and vegetables even when they were washed or peeled.","Pesticide exposure has been linked to all kinds of health conditions, from neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's to cancer and birth defects.","The jury, however, is still out as to whether or not the pesticides found in conventional foods are present in large enough quantities to actually make a difference to human health.","In the 2012 meta-analysis, conventional fruits and vegetables were found to have far more pesticide residue than organic produce, but the levels were almost always under the maximum amount allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency.","\"We\u2019re exposed to a cocktail of chemicals from our food on a daily basis,\" said Michael Crupain, the director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Food Safety and Sustainability Center, in an earlier post. \"It\u2019s not realistic to expect we wouldn\u2019t have any pesticides in our bodies in this day and age, but that would be the ideal. We just don\u2019t know enough about the health effects.\"","Some organic food skeptics have also pointed out that non-synthetic pesticides are used on some organic farms as well -- and the science is still hazy as to whether or not those compounds have ill effects.","When it comes to the nutritional value of organic food, there's also conflicting data.","The 2012 meta-analysis did not find any significant nutritional differences between conventional and organic foods. A meta-analysis published two years later in the British Journal of Nutrition, however, found that organic produce may have substantially higher concentrations of antioxidants and other potentially beneficial compounds.","A recent study, published in February, concluded that organic dairy and meat contain about 50 percent more omega-3 fatty acids.","\"Omega-3s are linked to reductions in cardiovascular disease, improved neurological development and function, and better immune function,\" wrote study co-author Chris Seal, a professor of food and human nutrition at the U.K.\u2019s Newcastle University. \"But getting enough in our diet is difficult. Our study suggests that switching to organic would go some way towards improving intakes of these important nutrients.\"","As for antibiotic use in food animals, the problems are more clear-cut.","The Centers for Disease Control notes that \"[s]cientists around the world have provided strong evidence that antibiotic use in food-producing animals can have a negative impact on public health\" because the drugs allow antibiotic-resistant bacteria to develop. So choosing organic meat, or meat raised without antibiotics, is better than conventional when it comes to this issue.","Other ways of measuring \"worth\":","When considering the benefits of organic food, it can be tempting to focus on the impacts of such products on human health. But as Marion Nestle, author of Food Politics and professor of nutrition at New York University, noted, choosing organic has implications for the Earth\u2019s well-being, too.","\"When done well, more work goes into producing organically, and organic methods are demonstrably better for soil and sustainability,\" she told HuffPost. \"Organics are about production values. Those values are important to me.\"","According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, an agency dedicated to addressing world hunger, there are many environmental benefits of organic agriculture, including long-term sustainability, greater biodiversity and better soil health.","But organic farming still isn't perfect. One meta-analysis found that though organic farming practices had fewer environmental impacts per acre, this was not necessarily true per product unit.","Though the health impacts of conventional foods on consumers remain unclear, the detrimental effects of pesticides and other chemicals are more clearly documented in the case of farmworkers. There's also some evidence that people living in farm communities are at risk for chronic health problems as a result of chemical exposure. Pesticides used in strawberry farms in California, for instance, are associated with an increased cancer risk among children living in those areas, according to the Department of Pesticide Regulation.","Lu said choosing organic can also have positive impacts on the food industry at large.","\"Promoting organic agriculture will attract a new cohort of farmers who believes in producing healthier and safer foods,\" he said. \"It\u2019s [also] good for the economy, by eliminating the corporative monopoly.\"","According to Food and Water Watch, economic power in the agriculture and food sector is unusually concentrated. The four largest companies, for instance, control 85 percent of soybean processing and 82 percent of the beef packing industry -- an oligopolistic situation that\u2019s economically harmful for both farmers and consumers.","\"Communities with more medium- and smaller-sized farms have more shared prosperity, including higher incomes, lower unemployment and lower income inequality, than communities with larger farms tied to often-distant agribusinesses,\" the nonprofit writes.","Many organic farms are small operations, though \"big organic\" farms do exist as well. If buying from a small farm is important to you, one option is to seek out a local farmers market, where you're often able to speak directly with a person who helped grow your produce.","Organic on a budget","Regularly purchasing organic products may simply not be financially feasible for many consumers, so Nestle suggests to just \"buy organic to the extent you can, when you can.\"","And there are ways to do it on the cheap (or at least, more cheaply):","1. Prioritize your purchases.","\"It is most important for young children, pregnant women, and those with weakened immune systems to eat organic food,\" advised Deborah Gerszberg, a nutritionist at Columbia University\u2019s Pancreas Center, in a blog post.","She also recommends buying organic animal products, including eggs and milk, as often as possible.","\"Some companies aren\u2019t certified organic, but still pledge not to use hormones or unnecessary antibiotics. This would be a good second choice,\" she said.","Choosing organic options for things that you or your household eat in large quantities is also a recommended practice. \"The repetitive intakes of pesticides from foods could cause more harm to your health than sporadic exposure,\" said Lu.","For produce, buy organic if you're planning to eat the skin of the fruit or vegetable.","\"Choose organic for the foods containing the highest amount of chemical residue, and choose conventional foods for foods with the least residue,\" said Gerszberg.","The Environmental Working Group's \"Dirty Dozen\" and \"Clean Fifteen\" lists are helpful resources on this front. The first highlights conventional produce with the highest pesticide loads (such as strawberries, apples, nectarines, grapes and spinach). The \"clean\" list, on the other hand, catalogs produce least likely to hold pesticide residues. These include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage and cauliflower.","2. Buy in season (and local, if possible). Buying organic produce in season tends to be much kinder on the wallet. In addition visiting a farmers market, you could try purchasing a crop share or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) to get local, in-season produce.","Locally grown food is often fresher and tastier than the alternative.","\"The crops are picked at their peak, and farmstead products like cheeses and are hand-crafted for best flavor,\" writes Vern Grubinger, a vegetable and berry specialist at the University of Vermont. \"Livestock products are processed in nearby facilities, and typically the farmer has direct relationship with processors, overseeing quality -- unlike animals processed in large industrial facilities.\"","Buying local food is a community investment, Grubinger adds -- a way to not just support local businesses, but also to protect local ecosystems and help communities become more self-sufficient. It also supports a more sustainable food system by significantly minimizing the use of fossil fuel-based transportation.","It's estimated that the average American meal travels about 1,500 miles to get from farm to plate, according to the Center for Urban Education about Sustainable Agriculture. In contrast, locally sourced food can travel 200 miles or less.","3. Buying generic and in bulk are money-savers too.","Many mainstream supermarkets, including Safeway, Target, Wal-Mart and H-E-B, carry organic store-brand options, while Costco, Sam's Club and BJ's sell organic foodstuffs in bulk. Some supermarkets, like Whole Foods, also have bulk bins stocked with organic grains, dried fruit, coffee and other products.","4. Keep an eye out for sales and coupons. Sites like All Natural Savings and Organic Deals can help customers surface organic food deals.","5. Grow your own food. It might sound daunting, but growing your own produce isn't as difficult as it sounds. It just requires a bit of effort and patience.

{"postId":"465028084585234432","postText":["This state is the most magical place in America"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["There's a reason \"Rocky Mountain High\" is one of Colorado's official state songs. Because regardless of your feelings on legalized pot, Colorado will leave you feeling absolutely magical.","If you're an urbanite, a mountaineer, a ski bum, a history nerd, an outdoor adventurer... you get the point... there is something for you in Colorado. And if you're not dazzled by the epic natural wonders Colorado has to offer, you might not have a soul.","Not convinced? Maybe these 19 reasons will prove that Colorado is the most magical state in America.","1. Because with \"300 days of sunshine,\" Colorado is one of the sunniest places in America.","And who doesn't love a sunny day? The \"300 days of sunshine\" thing is actually a myth. According to the Colorado Climate Center, there's no technical definition of \"days of sunshine,\" so measuring it gets tricky. They go on, however, to state that Colorado only has 30-40 overcast days per year, leaving at least 300 days of partial sunshine. They estimate only about 115 days that would fit the classic definition of clear... but 300 days of partial sunshine, at the least, still sounds awesome.","2. Being at a high altitude just makes things more fun.","Colorado has the highest average elevation in the country. The lowest point in Colorado, located at the Arikaree River, is 3,315 feet above sea level. The highest is Mt. Elbert, located at 14,433 feet above sea level. Denver, the state's capital, legitimately earns its nickname of \"Mile High City\" standing at an elevation of 5,280 feet high. At these elevations, the sun is stronger. You also could potentially get drunk faster.","3. Colorado is a beer-lover's happy place.","Colorado consistently ranks among the best craft brew states in America. The state has more than 200 breweries, including 130 microbreweries, according to USA Today's 2013 count. Denver itself has more than 20 breweries.","4. Because, the Rockies.","Whether you're into skiing, hiking, climbing, driving or just looking at pretty scenery, the Rocky Mountains are easily one of America's greatest natural wonders. Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the most visited national parks, for good reason. Breathtaking views are guaranteed, whether the mountains are blanketed in snow or lush green trees.","5. You can rock out surrounded by rocks at Red Rocks Amphitheater.","It's been called one of the best amphitheaters in America. If you can't get concert tickets, visiting by day and hiking a trail or having a picnic is a great way to experience Red Rocks.","6. Or spend some heavenly time at Garden of the Gods.","As far as U.S. natural wonders go, this is a must see. The National Natural Landmark offers beautiful rock formations and other archeological wonders.","7. Or visit the Flatirons, which are some of the coolest looking foothills you'll ever see.","The Flatirons are located in Boulder and have a rich climbing history. They're cool to view from afar and the climbs themselves offer terrific views and some challenging routes.","8. Winding mountain roads are basically nature's roller coaster.","Well, nature provided the mountain. Man built the road. But still, driving up and then down a mountain is an experience every thrill-seeker should experience, and the Rockies are perfect for it. Try Loveland Pass for steep climbs, hairpin turns and views that will make both your stomach and jaw drop.","9. Travel back in time and visit gold rush and mining towns.","These cool little old-school mining towns look like they're out of a movie (or Snow White, maybe?). Most people associate the gold rush with California, but let's not forget Pike's Peak and Colorado's role in the fun. Follow the Colorado Gold Trail and pass through gold and silver mine towns like Idaho Springs, Breckenridge and Black Hawk. Mine tours are also available in many towns as well.","10. Denver's homegrown burger chain, Smashburger, is beyond delicious.","While it's up for debate where the original smashburger came from, Smashburger as we know it today is Denver born and bred. Denver is also home to the first ever Chipotle... which is pretty cool, though you can eat Chipotle pretty much anywhere these days.","11. Or, if you're feeling really adventurous, you could always try Rocky Mountain Oysters.","Warning: Rocky Mountain Oysters are not actually oysters. They are bull testicles and they are a delicacy...we kid you not.","11. Coors Field is not just a place to watch baseball.","The home of the Colorado Rockies is consistently ranked as one of the top ballparks in the country. And the ballpark's not just for fans -- the over-the-top stadium offers plenty to eat and drink, and sweeping views of Denver and the mountains beyond. Tickets start as low as $4, so it's a great deal.","12. Colorado's welcome signs are cooler than yours.","13. Denver is mecca for all things delicious, fun and cheap.","Beer is cheap, ice cream is in abundance and the cost of living won't leave you totally broke. Denver is also near plenty of outdoor adventure, so urbanites can escape from the city whenever their hearts desire.","14. And Boulder is a haven for crunchy types with no shortage of activity, and awesome proximity to nature, of course.","15. Because you can walk into a recreational marijuana dispensary and buy marijuana, legally.","Both in-state residents and visitors (over 21-years-old) can shop at the dispensaries, though Coloradans can purchase more product than tourists. And these shops don't just sell weed... they sell marijuana-infused edibles, oils, beverages and more. If you fancy yourself a consumer of marijuana, you will be in heaven. Keep in mind, you can only smoke in private, buy from licensed dispensaries and cannot bring marijuana products out of the state.","16. Colorado is home to the North American Aerospace Defense Command... And you know what they do, right?","They track Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, duh.","17. Want some thrills? How about white water rafting? Zip lining? Ice climbing? Hang gliding?","The state is an adrenaline junkie's paradise.","18. Because Colorado sets records... Zombie Crawl records, that is.","19. And, if you haven't figured it out yet, Colorado is paradise for the outdoorsy type.","You can't beat these numbers -- Colorado boasts four national parks, 42 state parks, 11 national forests, two national grasslands and eight national wildlife refuges. There's always another trail to hike or mountain to climb... could you ever be bored?"],"targetTitle":"Colorado Is The Most Magical State In America","targetDescription":"There's a reason \"Rocky Mountain High\" is one of Colorado's official state songs .

It simply couldn't make enough toys to satiate demand in North America, and needed a break while it boosted capacity at its factories and increased its workforce by nearly a quarter.","\"We feel we need to invest, to build some breathing space,\" Lego's finance chief John Goodwin explained.","Lego, a family-owned company founded in Denmark in 1932, has enjoyed booming growth for decades. The company has released thousands of sets of its eponymous blocks, forging licensing deals with popular brands including Star Wars, Angry Birds and Disney Princesses. It has also taken on iconic architecture: A 2989-piece model of the Sydney Opera house is for sale on Lego's website for $399.99, while a 561-piece White House set sells for $89.99. A replica of the Ghostbusters firehouse, meanwhile, is listed for $499.99.","And the company's dominance has extended into the company's seven Legoland theme parks, 125 retail stores and dozens of video games. The Lego Movie, a full-length movie released in 2014, brought in $US468.2 million ($610.4 million) at the box office.","The company's revenue has increased by an average of 15 per cent a year in the past 12 years, according to Reuters.","The efforts to quell demand seem to have worked - at least temporarily. Sales in the Americas remained flat during the first half of 2016, according to the news agency. (Revenue in Asia and Europe, meanwhile, continued to grow by double digits.) Overall, Lego's revenue rose 11 per cent to roughly $US2.35 billion in the first half of the year, ahead of the $US1.83 billion reported by Mattel, the maker of Barbie.","But executives at Lego are hoping to ramp up production in time for this year's Christmas season, Goodwin said:","SHARE","Share on Facebook SHARE","Share on Twitter TWEET","Link Everything has been a bit too awesome for the world's most profitable toymaker, which is struggling to keep up with demand for its building blocks.","\"We are working very closely with our retail partners to ensure that as we go into the important holiday season, the back half of 2016, that we've got all of the levers pulled to get back on the growth trajectory.\"","The company is buildings its first factory in China, and is expanding existing plants in Mexico, Hungary and Denmark.

Well worry no longer, as the legendary filmmaker has told The Hollywood Reporter that he is not only \"super excited\" about the fifth installment but that adventure will still have a name at the end of the movie and that name will be Indiana Jones! \"I think this one is straight down the pike for the fans,\" said Spielberg, who would not reveal plot details, with one exception: \"The one thing I will tell you is I\u2019m not killing off Harrison [Ford] at the end of it.\" That\u2019s great news for fans who would likely balk at such an idea, the same way they would be furious if James Bond accidentally slipped in the shower and cracked his skull at the end of a (hypothetical) final 007 movie. Even if this turns out to be the last time Ford puts on the bullwhip and fedora, it doesn\u2019t mean the filmmakers have to have the death-defying character bite the dust. \"The opportunity to work with Steven again on this character which has brought pleasure to so many...

{"postId":"50jlah","postText":["7 Things We Know About the New Season of Stranger Things"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["+ READ ARTICLE","Netflix officially announced that a second season of Stranger Things will premiere in 2017. Until then you\u2019ll have to hold onto your wrist rockets, but The Duffer Brothers did give Entertainment Weekly teasers about the show to get everyone all jacked up for the new season.","Watch the teaser above, and here\u2019s what we know so far.","1. The action\u2019s going to pick back up in Fall of 1984. So plan accordingly by getting all your friends the correct walkie talkies to discuss the finer points of Steve\u2019s hair.","It will be a continuation of the first season\u2019s story. \"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it\u2019s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to 2.\"I think we talked like a larger time jump where the kids are older now and it\u2019s a different decade,\"Ross Duffer revealed to EW . \"That\u2019s something we batted around from the very beginning. But for us, there\u2019s still more story here, there\u2019s still things that are unresolved.\" These are the people coming right back at you, so you can continue to live life: Joyce, woman of light bulb chats (Winona Ryder); Mike (Finn Wolfhard), whose love for Eleven was huge; and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), the kid who says everything you can\u2019t, but the writer-directors were cryptic about Eleven . \"We don\u2019t know about Eleven,\" Ross Duffer says. \"We leave that up in the air.\" Disappointingly, no mention of whether the show\u2019s heartthrob Dr. Brenner lived to melt our hearts another day.","3. Expect four brand new characters. \"There\u2019s going to be a lot of new and interesting dynamics that we didn\u2019t see in season 1,\" Matt Duffer says. In the teaser, we see the words \"The Lost Brother.\" So fingers crossed Barb\u2019s mom can lose one more kid the show can drop like a bad habit, in case that family didn\u2019t endure enough misery.","There\u2019s one more major influence that will inspire this season. Bringing the show\u2019s 4.Bringing the show\u2019s tally of cool guys the Duffer Brothers admire up to 6 million, the new season will have a heavy James Cameron influence. Matt Duffer explained why. \"I know movie sequels get a lot of s\u2014, but the ones we look up to aspire to pivot and do something different,\" he says. \"There\u2019s Temple of Doom, Aliens, Terminator 2. I guess a lot of this is James Cameron. But he\u2019s brilliant. And I think one of the reasons his sequels are as successful as they are is he makes them feel very different without losing what we loved about the original. So I think we kinda looked to him and what he does and tried to capture a little bit of the magic of his work.\" We\u2019ll never let go, Barb. We\u2019ll never let go","Courtesy of Netflix Stranger Things","5. Good old monster-infested Hawkins won\u2019t be the only location. Season two will open on another town, the creators reveal. (It\u2019s conceivable that the Byers\u2019 and co. wanted to have a new beginning in a town without terrifying government operatives at every turn, but given that adorable little William coughs up a slug at the end, they\u2019re not escaping the past anytime soon.)","6. Everyone will still have access to the Upside Down. Great news, in case they want to go hang with the throat snakes for a fun long weekend for the whole family. There will be more discussion of the otherworld and some loose ends will be tied and the creators even posed some questions because a good teacher never keeps a curiosity door locked. They assure us the show will answer some long-marinating questions. \"We obviously have this gate to another dimension, which is still very much open in the town of Hawkins. And a lot of questions there in terms of, if the Monster is dead, was it a singular monster? What else could be out there? We really don\u2019t go in there much until they go in to find Will at the end. So we\u2019ve opened up this doorway, and to us it\u2019s exciting to talk about, like, what else is behind there? There\u2019s a lot more mystery there to be solved.\"","7. It will be nine episodes instead of eight. This way, fans can spend nine hours without moving in front of the screen, because life is fair. \"We\u2019re letting the story dictate it,\" says Matt. \"I think if it gets any longer, it gets unwieldy for us. We want to make sure it\u2019s manageable and we want to be able to tell a movie-like story where it\u2019s never treading water. We want it to have the same feel and pacing as season 1. I think if we extend it too much, it will have a very different feel.\""],"targetTitle":"7 Things We Know About the New Season of Stranger Things","targetDescription":"The Duffer Brothers reveal

{"postId":"426096936861843456","postText":["\"Mad Men\" star took 10 years to make this movie"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["After years of playing Roger Sterling on AMC\u2019s \"Mad Men,\" John Slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand. Sitting on a leather couch in Park City, Utah with a Bloody Mary by his side, Slattery talks less about the ad men of the 1960s and more about the first film that he directed, \"God\u2019s Pocket,\" which premiered at this year's Sundance Film Festival.","The dark comedy needs a better adjective than \"dark,\" because most of the film reveals deeply-rooted sadness, disappointment and failures \u2013- carried out to perfection by a dream-team cast that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman, Christina Hendricks, Richard Jenkins and John Turturro. Slattery has directed five episodes of \"Mad Men\" but this is his first attempt at a feature. Based on the theater\u2019s applause on opening night, his future as a director certainly looks bright.","The Huffington Post joined Slattery couch-side to find out why it took 10 years to make this happen, how surfing keeps him from getting \"a little screwy\" and why he refused to be in front of the camera this time.","[Warning: plot spoilers throughout]","When did you originally come across the material for \"God\u2019s Pocket\"?","I read the book by Pete Dexter about 10 years ago and tried to get the rights to it. But it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t get the rights, because I probably wouldn't be able to actually make a good movie then. I tried getting the rights but someone else owned them. So I let it go.","About five years later, someone reminded me of it and asked whatever happened to that book? Turns out the rights were then available. So I said, all right I\u2019m going to outline this thing, because I had written a shitty screenplay in between and I didn\u2019t want to do that again. I did an outline, about 100 pages long, and kind of just dumped everything from the book into it. I said, okay let\u2019s go get the rights, and then they came back to us and said that they had made a mistake. The rights were not available. Same people still owned it.","After you had put all that time into it!","I was making \"The Adjustment Bureau\" at the time and was sitting in a trailer for a large chunk of the day. So it was like are you going to watch TV or do this? When I was told I couldn\u2019t have it, I thought well if they have owned this thing for so long and haven\u2019t done anything with it I\u2019m just going to write it anyway. And if someone else makes it first, fine. Eventually Bob Gersh from The Gersh Agency worked out the deal.","Do you think it made the project that much more appealing because you couldn\u2019t have it at first?","It sort of alleviated the pressure of a production deal or deadline in a way. When you\u2019re sitting around, like actors do, and you start to go crazy because you need an outlet, I would do this. At the end of the day, I\u2019d put in a few hours and crank it around a little bit and I wouldn\u2019t feel crazy that day.","Do you have a different itch that\u2019s satisfied by writing versus acting?","It\u2019s the same if I were acting in a play or directing. Creative people go on vacation and four days in you\u2019re like I gotta get out of here. I have a lot of energy, so I\u2019m told. I surf a lot.","You live in L.A.?","Half the time. For \"Mad Men\" we\u2019re in New York so I have a place I go surfing in Long Island.","Isn\u2019t that freezing?","In the winter it is. But there\u2019s all kinds of gear now, it\u2019s like skiing almost. If I sit around and do nothing for a while, I get a little screwy.","What did you find most compelling about the material in \"God\u2019s Pocket\"? What made you want to make this film?","It\u2019s very visual, which appealed to me. I sort of see things in pictures -- I don\u2019t know whether that makes me dumb or smart. Like a kid almost. And the dialogue, by which I mean the characters, just the way they expressed themselves was interesting. It was a simple, to the point way of saying things without saying everything.","The book is very interior. It takes place in Mickey\u2019s head, which was difficult to do in a film. You have to show that, you can\u2019t tell it. That was a challenge. Mickey\u2019s state of mind and his anxiety in hanging on to this woman that he feels lucky to be with. He feels that if I lose this woman then I\u2019ll never get anybody else like that. I think there\u2019s a sentence that says he realized that would be the last woman he would ever get without paying for it. So even though she might not be in love with him anymore, he doesn\u2019t really belong in this place, he has no affinity for this place, he just has this woman.","What I think you get from Christina\u2019s performance is the disappointment she feels. He\u2019s not picking up on the signals of what she needs, you see them having sex and obviously that\u2019s not going very well. He can\u2019t express himself. And she needs something. She needs to find out what happened to her son. She needs him to step up and do the right thing, and he\u2019s trying but they\u2019re missing each other.","Did you consider acting in the film?","No. I got asked if I was going to, and every time I said no, people were like, \"good idea.\" [laughs] Which I was like, \"what the hell do you mean by that?\"","I ask because you\u2019ve directed a handful of \"Mad Men\" episodes.","That\u2019s the least sort of fun of the whole thing -\u2013 being in it. Some moments where you get relaxed enough where you know the scene, have done your homework, know the lines, and you sit down and it can be really fun. Because you know what you\u2019re doing on one side of the camera and know what you\u2019re doing on the other.","Like Woody Allen, I mean I would never even put myself in the same stratosphere, but he is Woody Allen. He knows what he knows and he has the time he has. Ben Affleck -- I have to say, I admire the hell out of that guy with a move like \"Argo.\" To direct it and then give that kind of performance. I don\u2019t know how the hell he dealt with that stress.","Another example of directors starring in movies is here at Sundance \u2013- Zach Braff\u2019s new film \"Wish I Was Here.\"","I\u2019m interested in Zach taking 10 years to do this. I\u2019m sure there are all kinds of reasons \u2013- he was acting, he was being successful in all kinds of ways. I\u2019d like to try it sometime, but you\u2019d have to build in the assurance that you have the proper amount of time so you didn\u2019t feel like \"Oh I shouldn\u2019t have done this.\"","How did you cast this film? Did you just ask Christina Hendricks at the water cooler to come be in your movie?","I went to Phil [Seymour Hoffman] first. You go through the proper channels because you don\u2019t want to burden anybody with \"do me a favor.\" That\u2019s a drag. I sent him the script and I anticipated that he would let me down easy and say I like it but I don\u2019t have time. I had sent it with an offer for the part of Shelburne. He called and said, \"I love the script, but I want to play Mickey.\" And it took me about two minutes to realize what a great idea that was. So I said all right, in.","Then I mentioned it to Christina because I was directing an episode of \"Mad Men\" and saw her through the monitor and just realized she was the perfect person. I hadn\u2019t gotten Phil to officially commit yet so I said here\u2019s the script, I\u2019d love you to play this part and I hope to get Phil. She was thrilled. I sent it to Richard Jenkins who is represented by my agent. About 45 minutes later, he called and said he was in. And then John Turturro read it and called up and said he was busy doing a movie but that he wanted to do it too. I was just floored.","There\u2019s a scene where Christina is up on a balcony and the men are below in the street looking up at her. She slowly walks inside and that quiet moment really illuminated how much power her character has in this film.","She condoned this guy being beaten to death because he took advantage of her. What I wanted to convey was that this is a woman who knows her currency. All these guys know their weight in the world -- whether it\u2019s slapping somebody around or using the way you look to get what you want. She knows this guy wants to get in her pants and she wants to find something out. She realized in that scene in the field that the way to do that is to let him do what he wants. But then he doesn\u2019t give her what she wants. And in the end she watches him getting beaten in the street and she just walks away, letting it happen. If she had said stop, they would have stopped.","You mentioned earlier that making this movie 10 years ago would have been very different. What do you think you bring to the table now?","I think just seeing more of everything. Life. You get to a point where you\u2019re young and you\u2019re an actor and everything is always about \"if I could just get this,\" \"if I could only get that.\" And then you start to realize this is my place in the food chain. This is what I do well. I don\u2019t do everything well. I can\u2019t play everything. I\u2019m not a movie star. I don\u2019t want to be a movie star. Your aspirations become more your own. And then it occurs to you to want to put your own foot forward creatively. You watch other people do their thing and you think, \"I could do this. I can try at this.\"","You also realize that there are sophisticated degrees of performing. There\u2019s actor A, B, C and then there\u2019s Phil Hoffman. And Richard Jenkins and Christina Hendricks and John Turturro. And the fact that they said yes .","That\u2019s also a testament to you.","But when it really comes down to it, it\u2019s because you recognize what they do. You really recognize what they\u2019re capable of doing and I should be so lucky to be able to work with those guys."],"targetTitle":"John Slattery's 'God's Pocket' Shows That Seriously Everyone Wants To Work With Him","targetDescription":"After years of playing Roger Sterling on AMC\u2019s \"Mad Men,\" John Slattery is comfortable with a drink in his hand.

{"postId":"170016066732231_252618548471982","postText":["You Can Be Mentally Stronger If You Do This Small Act Every Day"],"postPlatform":"Facebook","targetParagraphs":["As humans, we tend to set goals throughout our entire lives and dedicate most of our time trying to achieve them. That gives us purpose and motivation to strive forward. Yet, it can have detrimental consequences to our mental health, activating stress indicators that come as a byproduct of pushing ourselves too hard towards massive goals.","As psychologist Karl Weick suggests in his article \"Small Wins,\" we should make it an everyday practice to focus our attention towards the positive by counting each small win we make. By taking the Alcoholics Anonymous as an example, he suggests that the principle works due to the change in perspective. Instead of focusing on overwhelming and complex goals, participants are encouraged to choose small, achievable daily actions:","The impossibility of lifetime abstinence is scaled down to the more workable task of not taking a drink for the next 24 hours, drastically reducing the size of a win necessary to maintain sobriety.","By celebrating these small, daily wins, participants feel more confident and motivated to achieve the same satisfactory feeling the next day, and so the behavior gains momentum leading to an almost effortless achievement of the ultimate goal.","The Dangers of Dreaming Big","We are encouraged on a daily basis to \"dream big\" and set our bars high if we want to achieve great things. This phrase is an inescapable part of every motivational speech by almost every successful person who ever lived. There is nothing wrong in the saying itself, yet it tends to be misinterpreted by us, the regular mortals who are fascinated by fairy tale stories of dreams that come true to those who are brave enough to wish and focus on the ultimate goal.","For every great achievement ever made, there have been a million of small wins and breakthroughs that gradually led there, and this is something many people tend to overlook when working on achieving their goals. If we forget to appreciate the small wins we regularly make, the following negative consequences will appear:","Our sense of self-worth can be worsened","We risk feeling bad about ourselves and feeling incompetent when we constantly compare present state to our final goals, which can only lessen our chances of making progress","We are prone to the feeling of failure and depression when our goals can\u2019t be achieved","The increased amount of stress we have to cope with when we work on getting it all and now is counterproductive, as it blocks our productivity and weakens our physical health","Once we change the perspective from big to small and break our final goal into smaller, achievable chunks, we take the pressure off and avoid the risks to our health. By focusing on everyday progress, we automatically feel much more motivated, which causes our brain to get hooked on the positive rush and the feeling of accomplishment striving to achieve more. Understanding the importance of small wins and knowing how to apply it to your everyday life will cause tremendous benefits to your goal achieving and your overall health.","Here is the 4-step process you can take to develop the habit of celebrating small wins:","Step 1: Start small","First of all, you need to write down your final goal, and forget about it. It sounds silly, but this will help you focus on the fragments ahead of you, which is the only way to get things done. Instead of wasting energy on planning months ahead, focus on the next day\u2019s challenges only. Be here and now and only think one step ahead in order to move forward. This will give you the constant sense of accomplishment, which will motivate you to move forward and boost your self-esteem.","Step 2: Reflect often","Every once in a while, take some time to reflect on your progress. So often we focus on goals yet to be accomplished and forget about the progress that has already taken place. This means comparing yourself \u2014 with yourself. For example, if your goal is to lose certain amount of weight, instead of beating yourself up for not getting there yet, you should compare some older photos of yourself to the new ones. By doing so, you will get the visual proof of your progress which serves as great inspiration for future advances and inspires positive emotions.","Step 3: Reward yourself","From early childhood, we get familiar with the achievement \u2014 reward formula which makes us consider it a norm in each such situation. Therefore, if you achieve certain success, no matter how big or small, your mind expects that you provide yourself with an adequate prize. If the reward doesn\u2019t come, your motivational fuel gets drained, making your efforts futile.

A spectator's perspective, where you're worried about rolls of fat hanging out, what that leg looks like... it gets in the way of sexual pleasure. So if there's anything I can pitch to you about why you don't want to live in a culture that sexually objectifies: it diminishes your sexual pleasure.","Heldman drew on the work of others to create a 7-step test to determine if an image is sexually objectifying. An image is sexually objectifying if \"yes\" is the answer to any of the following questions:","Does the image show only parts of a sexualized person's body? Does the image present a sexualized person as a stand-in for an object? Does the image show a sexualized person as interchangeable? Does the image affirm the idea of violating the bodily integrity of a sexualized person that can't consent? Does the image suggest that sexual availability is the defining characteristic of the person? Does the image show a sexualized person as a commodity?

{"postId":"4pjlnj","postText":["Why We Sent a Reporter to Work as a Private Prison Guard"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Read Mother Jones reporter Shane Bauer's firsthand account of his four months spent working as a guard at a corporate-run prison in Louisiana.","In 1887, a 23-year-old journalist got herself checked into the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island in New York City. When she emerged, she wrote about patients tied together with ropes, abusive staff and ubiquitous vermin, \"lunatics\" treated with nothing more restorative than ice baths, and, perhaps most disturbingly, patients who seemed to be perfectly sane, dumped there by a society that had few safety nets for women who were single, poor, and often immigrants.","Serialized by Joseph Pulitzer's New York World, Nellie Bly's accounts (later collected in a book called Ten Days in a Mad-House) caused a sensation, fueled in no small part by her pluck\u2014she'd begun her career by writing a scathing rebuttal to an editorial titled \"What Girls Are Good For\"\u2014though her inge\u0301nue looks couldn't have hurt, either. But despite prose that shades purple to today's ears, Bly's work holds up not only for its daring, but for its impact: It prompted a grand jury investigation that led to changes she'd proposed, including a $26 million (in today's dollars) increase to the budget of the city's Department of Public Charities and Correction and regulations to ensure that only the seriously mentally ill were committed.","Access to prisons has been vastly curtailed. There is no way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.","Bly\u2014who'd go on to get herself arrested so she could investigate conditions at a women's prison, and to best Jules Verne's fictional protagonist by circumnavigating the world in 72 days\u2014was not the first journalist to go inside an institution to expose its inner workings. Or the last. Ted Conover also reported from behind prison walls, as did Ben Bagdikian, for whom MoJo's fellowship program is named. In 1961, John Howard Griffin ingested a chemical that darkened his skin to investigate racial apartheid in the United States. Barbara Ehrenreich took jobs at chain restaurants and Walmart to spotlight the plight of low-wage workers. Mac McClelland worked as a picker in a warehouse of an online shipping behemoth to report for Mother Jones.","But while such investigations were commonplace in the muckraker era, they've grown increasingly rare. Why? First, there's a real concern over ethics. When is it okay for reporters to not announce themselves as such? There's no governing body of journalism, but a checklist written by Poynter ethicist Bob Steele provides guidelines for assessing when this kind of reporting is acceptable. I'll paraphrase:","When the information obtained is of vital public interest.","When other efforts to gain that information have been exhausted.","When the journalist is willing to disclose the reason and nature of any deception.","When the news organization applies the skill, time, and funding needed to fully pursue the story.","When the harm prevented outweighs any harm caused.","After meaningful deliberation of the ethical and legal issues.","To see what private prisons are really like, Shane Bauer applied for a job with the Corrections Corporation of America. He used his own name and Social Security number, and he noted his employment with the Foundation for National Progress, the publisher of Mother Jones. He did not lie. He spent four months as a guard at a CCA-run Louisiana prison, and then we spent 14 more months reporting and fact-checking.","We took these extraordinary steps because press access to prisons and jails has been vastly curtailed in recent decades, even as inmates have seen their ability to sue prisons\u2014often the only way potential abuses would pop up on the radar of news organizations or advocates\u2014dramatically reduced. There is no other way to know what truly happens inside but to go there.","But here's the other reason investigations like this one have grown so rare: litigation. When ABC News busted Food Lion for repackaging spoiled meat for sale back in 1992, a jury bought the company's line that the real offense had been the falsification of employment applications and the reporters' failure to fulfill their assigned duties\u2014i.e., repackaging spoiled meat! The $5.5 million damage award was eventually knocked down to just two dollars, but it put a chill on this kind of muckraking for a generation, and during that time, corporate and official entities built an ever-tighter web of legal protections. Nondisclosure agreements\u2014once mainly the provenance of people who work on Apple product launches and Beyonce\u0301 videos\u2014are now seeping into jobs of all stripes, where they commingle with various other \"non-disparagement\" clauses and \"employer protection statutes.\" Somewhere along the way, employers' legitimate interest in protecting hard-won trade secrets has turned into an all-purpose tool for shutting down public scrutiny\u2014even when the organizations involved are more powerful than agencies of government.","Companies' interest in protecting trade secrets has turned into a tool for shutting down public scrutiny.","Or when, for that matter, they replace the government. When CCA (which runs 61 prisons, jails, and detention centers on behalf of US taxpayers) learned about our investigation, it sent us a four-page letter warning that Shane had \"knowingly and deliberately breached his duty to CCA by violating its policies,\" and that there could be all manner of legal consequences. The letter came not from CCA's in-house counsel, but from the same law firm that had represented a billionaire megadonor in his three-year quest to punish us for reporting on his anti-LGBT activities. When he lost, he pledged $1 million to support others who might want to sue us, and, though we won the case, were it not for the support of our readers the out-of-pocket costs would have hobbled us.","Shane's story will draw a fair bit of curiosity around the newsgathering methods employed. But don't let anyone distract you from the story itself. Because the story itself is revealing as hell.","If you think stories like this need to be told, please make a tax-deductible donation to Mother Jones to help underwrite our investigations."],"targetTitle":"Why We Sent a Reporter to Work as a Private Prison Guard","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":"Corporations,Crime+and+Justice,Investigations,Prisons,Top+Stories","targetMedia":["http:\/\/googleads.g.doubleclick.net\/pagead\/viewthroughconversion\/941756981\/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0","http:\/\/motherjones.com\/sites\/all\/assets\/MJ_comp.png","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/edletter_2000x1124.png","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/top-of-content-image\/edletter_2000x1124.png","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-Be0QSW1bbb6Qv.gif","http:\/\/adserver.adtechus.com\/adserv|3.0|5443.1|4170840|0|529|ADTECH;loc=300;key=key1+key2+key3+key4;alias=","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/imagecache-300x169\/cca_tower-close_2000.jpg","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/imagecache-300x169\/414_cca4_d.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=8027488&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/imagecache-300x169\/414_cca3_a.jpg","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/imagecache-300x169\/master_cca.jpg","http:\/\/www.motherjones.com\/files\/imagecache\/author-thumb-80x80\/photo\/jefferyclara-web100.jpg","http:\/\/motherjones.com\/sites\/all\/assets\/MJ_comp_grey.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/motherjones.com\/politics\/2016\/06\/cca-private-prisons-investigative-journalism-editors-note","id":210}

And only 22 percent of infants are exclusively breastfed to 6 months, which the WHO recommends due to breastmilk\u2019s unparalleled nutritional properties. Those deficiencies are largely due to a lack of institutional support, as less than half of moms receive any paid time off after childbirth, limiting their ability to breastfeed.","The report also found that at least 40 percent of parents introduce solid foods and sugary drinks to their children too early, and one in four toddlers don\u2019t receive enough iron in their diet.","That doesn\u2019t even begin to address all the economic factors at play.","\"Half of the babies born in this country are participating in Women, Infants and Children program here in the United States,\" Lucy Sullivan, the executive director of 1,000 Days, said on Capitol Hill Wednesday, referring to the program commonly known as WIC.","\"That\u2019s a reminder that the problems we are dealing with is not a small population over here somewhere in the U.S. that maybe looks like the population of a developing country,\" she added. \"It is all of us. The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America.\"","Hugh Welsh, the president of DSM, a major global producer of vitamins, minerals and nutrition supplements, highlighted the lack of understanding in the U.S. about the dire need for a well-balanced mix of vitamins and nutrients.","\"I could travel to Malawi, and everyone there would understand, but I could travel to Milwaukee and no one would understand what I was talking about with micronutrients,\" he said.","In the first 1,000 days of a child\u2019s life, the brain needs the proper mix of nutrients to fully form. Without enough iron or specific vitamins, a child\u2019s brain may never form all its potential synapses. They can also be physically weaker, and the combination can set the child up to be less competitive in the workforce later in life and raise their health care costs.","Experts also worry that the nutritional diets of infants today mimic those of a growing number of overweight and obese American adults, setting them up for a lifetime unhealthy food choices and health problems.","The face of hunger and malnutrition looks like America. Lucy Sullivan, Executive Director of 1,000 Days","Barbara Bush, daughter of former President George W. Bush and the CEO and co-founder of Global Health Corps, stressed the irreversibility of the first 1,000 days.","\"You can\u2019t catch up,\" she told The Huffington Post. \"It will impact everything you do, whether that be how you learn or if you can learn fully and all of your mechanisms to engage in life.\"","Rep.

The panel and congressional leaders highlighted the need for legislation about increased nutritional information and paid family leave.","Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said the issue requires bipartisan action.","\"This has to be a commitment to putting kids, and their need for access to food and nutrition, in the front of the agenda,\" Casey said. He called for a Marshall Plan for the children of America, much like the billions of dollars in economic support the U.S. gave to Europe after WWII.","Bush echoed those calls to action, stressing that America\u2019s children need access to these fundamental nutrients as they grow.","\"The most devastating part is when you are 2 years old and younger, you don\u2019t have a lot of control over your life,\" she said. \"But it can have an impact on your life in perpetuity.\""],"targetTitle":"Sadly, This Is The Top Vegetable 1-Year-Olds In America Eat","targetDescription":"A report released Wednesday highlighted how nutrition in a child's first 1,000 days helps determine their future, and the country\u2019s.","targetKeywords":"childhood nutrition","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/2000_1000\/57dff0e11800002f003157e7.jpeg?cache=nrg4ktgsxk","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/childhood-nutrition-america_us_57d9ad32e4b0071a6e0501c5?section=&amp;","id":211}
{"postId":"4l2uha","postText":["A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave in France"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France\u2019s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski\u2019s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Some 336 meters into the cave, the caver stumbled across something extraordinary\u2014a vast chamber where several stalagmites had been deliberately broken. Most of the 400 pieces had been arranged into two rings\u2014a large one between 4 and 7 metres across, and a smaller one just 2 metres wide. Others had been propped up against these donuts. Yet others had been stacked into four piles. Traces of fire were everywhere, and there was a mass of burnt bones.","These weren\u2019t natural formations, and they weren\u2019t the work of bears. They were built by people. Recognizing the site\u2019s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn\u2019t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They\u2019ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible.\" A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn\u2019t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\"","She knew that Rouzaud\u2019s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique\u2019s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \"I\u2019m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\" says Verheyden. \"It\u2019s kind of magical, even without the structures.\" After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave\u2019s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \"When I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\" says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins\u2014collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient.","And if Rouzaud\u2019s work made it unlikely that modern humans built the rings, Verheyden\u2019s study grinds that possibility into the dust. Neanderthals must have been responsible. There simply wasn\u2019t any other hominin in that region at that time. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious.\" Why did they build the rings and mounds? The structures weren\u2019t foundations for huts; the chamber contains no stone tools, human bones, or any other sign of permanent occupation, and besides, why build shelter inside a cave? \"A plausible explanation is that this was a meeting place for some type of ritual social behavior,\" says Paola Villa from the University of Colorado Museum. \"When you see such a structure so far into the cave, you think of something cultural or religious, but that\u2019s not proven,\" adds Verheyden. Indeed, despite some fanciful speculations about cave bear cults, no one really knows. Nor is it clear how the Neanderthals made the structures. Verheyden says it couldn\u2019t have been one lone artisan, toiling away in the dark. Most likely, there was a team, and a technically skilled one at that. They broke rocks deliberately, and arranged them precisely. They used fire, too. More than 120 fragments have red and black streaks that aren\u2019t found elsewhere in the chamber or the cave beyond. They were the result of deliberately applied heat, at intensities strong enough to occasionally crack the rock. \"The Neanderthal group responsible for these constructions had a level of social organization that was more complex than previously thought,\" the team writes."],"targetTitle":"A Shocking Find in a Neanderthal Cave in France","targetDescription":"A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found.","targetKeywords":"The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life","targetMedia":["http:\/\/atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/atlanticprod\/1\/H.23.6--NS\/0","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6463921&cv=2.0&cj=1","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1407501962855831&ev=NoScript","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-906344h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-b0K-eQJGBXxXE.gif","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/None\/_R7A6312_1\/headshot.jpg?1485193950","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/mt\/2016\/05\/CNRS_20160048_0006\/facebook.jpg?1464180693","https:\/\/cdn.theatlantic.com\/assets\/media\/img\/mt\/2016\/05\/CNRS_20160048_0006\/lead_960.jpg?1464180693","http:\/\/atlanticmedia.122.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/atlanticprod\/1\/H.22--NS\/0"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/science\/archive\/2016\/05\/the-astonishing-age-of-a-neanderthal-cave-construction-site\/484070\/","id":212}

It\u2019s not every day you come across a porn star, especially whilst you\u2019re at work. I wonder if the happy rescuers asked Gomez about her upcoming live porn movie \u2013 which is due to air in August. I imagine they did.

This is what they do. They are prolific and ruthless \u2014 a juggernaut of the highest order.","If anything, the Warriors have given the Cavs opportunities in the first two games of the series: In Game 1, the Splash Brothers combined to shoot 30 percent from the floor and the Warriors only made nine 3-pointers total. In Game 2, Golden State turned the ball over 20 times.","Those were windows \u2014 the cracks might have been small, but there was a gap there, and the Cavs couldn't take advantage of it. The simple truth loomed too large.","The Warriors made 15 3-pointers while the Cavs made 5 on Sunday, a difference of 30 points in a 33-point Warriors win \u2014 the seventh-largest margin of victory in NBA Finals history.","The Cavs came into Sunday's game saying they were going to shoot more 3-pointers, that they were going to go back to playing the style that pushed them through the Eastern Conference Playoffs with ease.","It was going to be hard \u2014 coach Tyronn Lue was clearly fond of telling reporters over the two-day gap between Games 1 and 2 that it's nearly impossible to create ball movement against the Warriors' defense, which switches assignments at all five positions \u2014 but the Cavs had to try, it was the only path to victory.","Instead, the Cavs shot two more 3-pointers in Game 2 compared to Game 1. They made two fewer. Overall, Cleveland is 12-of-44 from beyond the arc in this series, while J.R. Smith, the team's most prolific 3-point shooter, has made only two shots from distance in the Finals and is shooting a 3-pointer once every 10 minutes he's on the court. The Warriors are smothering him, and he's not a dynamic enough player to create his own shot -- at least not an effective one.","How do the Cavs win a game in this series? It certainly appears that it's going to take some impressive changes and adjustments to do so \u2014 the kind of changes that look beyond Lue, who inexplicably blamed not getting to 50-50 balls and not making the \"tougher plays\" as the reasons behind his team's blowout loss Sunday.","Not being beaten in every single aspect of the game, as LeBron James said in his postgame press conference \u2014 50-50 balls.","The Cavaliers are in the deepest 2-0 hole in NBA Finals history \u2014 the Warriors' 48-point differential is the largest ever through two games \u2014 and it has almost nothing to do with 50-50 balls.","It has to do with the Warriors' elite defense. It has to do with the Warriors' bench being worthy of a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. It has to do with Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love being underachieving one-way players in a series that demands two-way play against a team that has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they'll exploit weak defenders with cruel efficiency. It has to do with the Cavs needing J.R. Smith to be a consistent offensive producer on a nightly basis if they plan on winning. It has to do with the Cavs daring Draymond Green to beat them and then him doing just that. It has to do with Cleveland changing its offensive system and defensive ideology on the fly against perhaps the greatest team of all-time.","It has to do with the simple truth that 3 is greater than 2.","The Cavs clearly haven't learned that lesson yet, and unless a truly unpredictable turnaround is looming, it's too late for them to do anything about it."],"targetTitle":"The simple reason the

{"postId":"810282611591483393","postText":["The future of fast food has arrived and it's a one-of-a-kind experience"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.","Eatsa, an innovative, vegetarian automated restaurant chain, which just opened its first East Coast location (in New York) on Wednesday, is looking to revolutionize the food industry by offering customers a one-of-a-kind food experience.","The tech-savvy restaurant aims to offer fresh, affordable food fast, but with an unconventional twist: It replaces the presence of good old-fashioned cashiers and waiters with... robots.","Instead of the usual face-to-face ordering and pickup, customers at Eatsa simply order their food by means of in-store kiosks, online or through an app on their phones. The food then mysteriously appears on location in a glass \"cubby\" displaying the customer's name, and they're free to chow down. This means no lines, no counter and no human conversation, because what could be worse? ","The concept, while intriguing, also sounds a bit terrifying. So with a mind full of skepticism Mashable headed down to the newly opened Midtown Manhattan location to see what all the hype is about.","While one might assume a cashier-free environment would be completely devoid of human interaction, that was far from the case. Though I initially feared the establishment would have a lifeless art gallery-esque vibe, the music was pumping, the customers were chatting and upon walking into the sleek restaurant I was instantly greeted by a friendly Eatsa \"mascot.\"","Much like Apple Geniuses, Eatsa has several employees stationed on the floor to offer customer assistance and ensure you're not entirely left alone. \"There are always people on the floor \u2014 our mascots, we call them \u2014 and we\u2019re out here helping the guests and getting them through the process,\" explained Scott Bruggman, an Eatsa corporate trainer who began as an R&D chef creating bowls.","To the right of the wood-floored room stood a row of electronic ordering kiosks, and to the left, the restaurant had several tables for those who wanted to engage in a slightly more familiar dining experience. This all felt relatively tame, but the back of the restaurant held the real magic: a wall made entirely of electronic, microwave-looking cubbies that would reveal your mysteriously prepared meal. Zap. ","Since there was no one to take my order, I made my way to the kiosk to choose from the customizable bowls, bites and beverages on Eatsa's strictly vegetarian menu. Once I put in my request for a Hummus & Falafel Bowl, I walked toward the illuminated cubbies and within minutes my name was displayed on the screen above them, alerting me that my order was up. This was the moment of truth.","Right before your food arrives in your cubby, Eatsa fills you with intrigue. Your cubby turns completely dark to prevent you from seeing the secrets of the kitchen and tantalizingly displays the words, \"It's coming.\" After you're given a playful peek at your meal, the cubby gives you the literal green light and you can receive your meal by tapping the glass twice.","TBH, it felt like something straight out of The Jetsons.","The process was quick, simple and the food was fresh, as promised.","Though I was satisfied with the space-age experience, I couldn't stop wondering what the hell was going on behind that wall of mystery. I turned to Dean Marsh, director of market operations for the East Coast for some answers, but was kindly shut down. Marsh adamantly explained that much like the secrecy of costumed characters at Disney World, the public is not supposed to know what truly goes on in the depths of the Eatsa kitchen.","Very ominous.","Despite the attempt to keep the tricks of the trade to themselves, many believe that several human chefs work alongside robots. \"The Eatsa bots are back there,\" Bruggman said. \"There\u2019s a lot of different things going on and we use as much technology as we can to better enhance the experience.\"","First-time customers and vegetarians Madee Bryke and her boyfriend Andrew Powell also had their theories. \"There are people back there; I know that,\" Bryke said. \"I think it\u2019s fun that there\u2019s robots, but there are definitely people still working.\"","As of right now, Bruggman described the tech and human ratio as \"a real blend \u2014 that\u2019s how we make it so fast and so quick.\"","With the rise of technology creating strong barriers against personal interaction, one of the major concerns the innovative restaurant raises is that the lack of human interaction may come across as too impersonal.","While this may seen like a dream for introverts, surprisingly, the futuristic vibe only made things more fun. Millennials, such as Sabina M. who works a few blocks away and was eating there for the second day in a row, felt that if anything, the environment was encouraging people to be more social. \"Maybe it\u2019s just because of the novelty,\" she said, \"but it seems like people are almost more social here cause everyone\u2019s like woah this is crazy. So it\u2019s kind of getting people to talk to one another.\" ","Bryke and Powell, also millennials, agreed. \"I definitely think it almost opens it up to more talk, it seems like they have a community,\" Bryke said.","Her boyfriend, Powell, said that when you think about it, the automated restaurant is not much different from other forms of take-out. \"People already order Seamless and then go pick it up from a delivery guy so how is this much different? It\u2019s almost like a robot\u2019s making it anyways.\"","To get a sense of how the older demographic was feeling about the revolutionary service, Gen X-er and first-time customer, Maarten Nederlof gave Mashable his two-cents. \"We\u2019re a little older and have been watching the whole decline in social interaction,\" he said. \"So this is a walk on the non-interacting side for us, but I think for younger people who have no social interaction, coming here is a great avoidance scheme.\"","Nederlof explained that there are still tables, so people getting food can sit down inside and socialize. Therefore it's the best of both worlds. \"Are you really missing out on that much?\" he questioned. ","Marsh, director of market operations for Easta, feels the restaurant's technology is actually giving people more time to engage in social interaction. \"Where you may spend 15 to 20 minutes at any of our competitors getting in and out with the regular fast food concept, for us it's three to four minutes. We feel that extra time gives you even more time interact with people,\" he said. ","Though the Manhattan Eatsa has only been open for a few days, the restaurant's unique style is receiving a lot of love (just like like the five other locations in California and D.C.)","\"Every restaurant competitor on the street has been in at least two times and we\u2019ve only been open for two days. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of interest from the big boys: the McDonalds and Starbucks of the world,\" he said.","What's next? Perhaps an automated restaurant to please all the meat-eaters out there."],"targetTitle":"Waiter-less, cashier-less restaurant is the stuff of the future","targetDescription":"We've seen the future of fast food and it's full of secretive cooking, utensils popping out of walls and a whole lot of quinoa.","targetKeywords":"new-york, conversations, food, restaurant, tech","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":216}

In addition to feature films, it also includes comic books, short films, and television series. Films in the MCU have been split into three distinct phases.","It was acquired back in 2009 by the Walt Disney Co. DIS for $4 billion. Many were worried that the deal would both ruin beloved Marvel characters like Iron Man and damage Disney's financial standing and stock valuation. Fast forward to 2016, and Disney's acquisition could very well be one of the best things to happen to both the media giant and the comic book publisher.","However, it looks like the MCU is quickly coming to an end, at least as we know it. In an interview with IGN , Anthony Russo-who will be directing the upcoming Avengers films with his brother Joe-said that \"these two movies are intended to be the culmination of everything that has happened in the MCU since the very first Iron Man movie...In being a culmination, these movies are in some ways going to be an end to certain things, and in some ways, they're going to be the beginning of certain things.\"","With this in mind, how much money has Marvel grossed at the total worldwide box office? And how much more can it bring in? Let's break it down:","Phase One","Iron Man - $585,174,222","The Incredible Hulk - $263,427,551","Iron Man 2 , bringing in $623,933,331","Thor - $449,326,618","Captain America: The First Avenger - $370,569,774","The Avengers - $1,518,594,910","Phase Two","Iron Man 3 - $1,518,594,910","Thor: The Dark World - $644,783,140","Captain America: The Winter Soldier - $714,121,534","Guardians of the Galaxy - $774,176,600","Avengers: Age of Ultron - $1,398,858,115","Ant-Man - $518,585,201","Phase Three","Phase three is just in its beginning stage, but will wrap up by 2019. The first of the last 10 films of the MCU, Captain America: Civil War , brought in almost $1.5 billion worldwide during its theatrical release.","Audiences can look forward to Doctor Strange hitting theaters this fall; Guardians of the Galaxy 2 , Spider-Man: Homecoming , and Thor: Ragnarok debuting in 2017; Black Panther , Avengers: Infinity War , and Ant-Man and the Wasp premiering in 2018; and Captain Marvel and the untitled Avengers sequel coming to theaters in 2019.","The Marvel Effect","As of now, the MCU has grossed $10,527,843,932 at the box office, and if the next nine films can live up to each of their respective predecessors, the franchise could very well double, and even triple, its worldwide earnings. Both of the next Avengers films could easily make $1 billion each, and if the next Guardians , Thor , and Ant-Man movies follow in common sequel fashion, they could all make well over their originals' total earnings.","Predicting gross profit from films is difficult, as Hollywood accounting is notoriously complicated, but it is safe to argue that Marvel has proven to be the ultimate money maker. Its films, comics, TV shows, merchandise, and all other revenue sources show that Disney made the entertainment deal of a lifetime.","Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"postId":"407878099464769536","postText":["Most millennials believe student debt is a \"major\" problem\u2014and this is who they blame."],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["NEW YORK -- A majority of young Americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem.","Fifty-eight percent of adults ages 18 to 24 consider rising student debt levels in the United States a \"major problem,\" according to survey results released exclusively to The Huffington Post on Tuesday by the Harvard University Institute of Politics. Only 3 percent said it's not an issue at all, while 22 percent called it a \"minor problem.\" Yet even among people who weren't enrolled in college, 54 percent still considered student debt a major issue.","A plurality -- 39 percent -- blame colleges and universities for the rising amount of student debt, compared with just 10 percent who think students are at fault. Survey respondents were more likely to blame colleges for rising student debt if they were currently enrolled in school.","The cost of a college degree has increased 12-fold in the last 30 years, while having such a degree has become even more important to those seeking full-time employment. But policy experts and consumer watchdogs have increasingly flagged the wealth loss and ripple effect that the nation's $1.2 trillion in student debt is having on the economy as a whole.","\"Young people who are coming of age today understand that getting a postsecondary education is important [but] they have a lot of fear about the rising cost of higher education,\" said Rory O'Sullivan, Policy and Research Director at Young Invincibles, a group that aims to represent young people in policy debates.","Matthew Segal, co-founder and head of millennial advocacy nonprofit OurTime.org, was \"pleasantly surprised\" to see that young adults are putting responsibility for the trend with colleges.","\"People are finally realizing that the college arms race must stop if we are ever going to rein in costs,\" Segal said.","Segal noted that George Washington University, for instance, is currently building a $130 million \"super dorm\" on campus, and students at the University of Pennsylvania are able to dine at a juice bar after hitting up the golf simulator at one of the campus fitness centers. This phenomena of spending resources on extravagant secondary amenities isn't limited to private schools, either: Iowa State University recently spent $46.2 million renovating one of two campus gyms, resulting in a facility equipped with rock walls and hot tubs, while the University of California-Davis offers swimming pools in some residence halls.","\"Too many colleges are acting in the interest of building prestige over providing an affordable pathway to higher learning for their students,\" Segal said.","However, 32 percent of respondents in the new survey pointed the finger at the federal government, which handles roughly 85 percent of the nation's outstanding student debt. The U.S. Department of Education collected $42.5 billion from borrowers in fiscal year 2013 alone.","Although O'Sullivan believes there's plenty of blame to go around, he was struck by how few placed responsibility on state governments, despite the connection between state legislative appropriations and tuition at public colleges. Only 8 percent of Harvard's survey respondents said state governments were to blame for rising student loan debt.","A 2012 New York Federal Reserve study linked mounting tuition costs at public universities, where a majority of students get their degrees, to state budget cuts. A previous Huffington Post\/YouGov poll found most Americans believe state universities are no longer affordable.","\"We invest less than we used to, per student,\" O'Sullivan noted.","Young Invincibles is currently working with student groups on campuses to raise awareness of how the state budget process affects their tuition bill. O'Sullivan believes the trillion-dollar number has captured the attention of many people, but now it's important to explain why student debt is big and \"what it is we need to fix it.\"","More than 7 in 10 in the Harvard poll said that their own financial circumstances were an important factor in whether or not they attended college.","The Huffington Post collaborated with the Harvard Institute of Politics on questions asked of college-age Americans. A larger update to Harvard's biennial study of younger Americans will be publicly released Wednesday."],"targetTitle":"Many Young Americans Blame Colleges For Rising Student Debt","targetDescription":"NEW YORK -- A majority of young Americans say student debt is a major issue facing the nation, a new poll finds, and many blame colleges for the problem....","targetKeywords":"harvard poll,student debt blame,college loans,student debt harvard,student debt,student loan poll,student debt poll,majoring in debt,young americans student debt,financial education,student loans,cost of college","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/257599\/slide_257599_1654666_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1492239\/images\/o-STUDENT-LOAN-DEBT-facebook.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1cj2wrA","id":219}

The couple is still seen together with their children. Case and point, their family trip to London and Paris last month while Ben Affleck was filming Justice League.","Neither Ben nor Jen will confirm or deny the divorce allegations. Ben still calls Jennifer his \"wife\" as he did during an HBO interview with Bill Simmons last week. Despite his unusual appearance on Any Given Wednesday, Ben Affleck was very clear once more how supportive Jennifer Garner was of him while he rebuilt his career.","But as recent as three weeks ago, Jennifer Garner had plans on divorcing her husband. So does Ben\u2019s HBO appearance mean he still hopes they can reconcile? Does he still believe he can get Jen to come around and change her mind and not finally file divorce papers?","According to an exclusive ET Online report, a source quotes that they are making it work. They also come right out and say that they don\u2019t know if they will ever get a divorce: \"They still have not officially filed paperwork for a divorce,\" the source reiterates.","ET also noted since their split, the two have established a co-parenting routine with ben remaining close to Jen and the kids.","They\u2019re still legally married, but separated. They both live on their property in Brentwood California. Another source told ET: \"They\u2019re in a good place and co-parenting the best they can.\"","Confused? ET did it\u2019s best to get to the bottom of this conundrum. Do Ben and Jen know what they\u2019re intensions are? Do they share every relationship up and down with the press and let the tabloids write what they will? Or, do the pair have things worked out and simply tell the press what it wants to hear in order to keep their lives private and press distracted?","Radar Online has an interview with Jennifer\u2019s father after the devastating floods that hit West Virginia. Her dad remains mum about the status of his daughter\u2019s relationship, saying he\u2019d leave it up to the couple to discuss their personal lives.","People Magazine has published two conflicting stories. One friend of Jennifer\u2019s says: \"nothing has changed\" in the relationship: \"They\u2019re still all about putting the kids first.\"","Yet another report states that Ben doesn\u2019t want a divorce and Jen has denied to friends that they\u2019ve reconciled. The friend also said that Jen doesn\u2019t mind that the divorce hasn\u2019t been finalized, but she still intends on going through with it.","And to pile on more confusion, the same friend said that Jen really enjoyed her time with Ben and their kids in Europe. She liked spending time with Ben again. And yet another source said: \"They have a lot of admiration and respect for each other\"","So which is it? Will they or won\u2019t they divorce? Will Ben Affleck and Jen Garner continue to play this game with the press, teasing the tabloids while not really giving them an answer?

{"postId":"827023959380094977","postText":["'Please value life'"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["A new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in Taiwan. It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy.","Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time.","\"She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,\" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers.","As a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan.","The shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down.","On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan.","Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short.","But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure.","You might also be interested in","In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down.","\"I went home and cried all night,\" she said.","But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the \"beautiful slaughterer\".","Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters.","\"They called her a butcher... We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,\" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers.","\"But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough.\"","High kill rate","Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce.","In reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions.","But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed.","In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness.","In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down.","\"We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the 'humane room'.","\"When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad.\"","No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan.","The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter.","But a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide.","\"She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,\" said Ms Lai.","In the letter, Ms Chien wrote: \"I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]... Please value life.\"","The irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out.","Newspapers accused the government of \"murdering\" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing.","Some accused \"higher-level bureaucrats\" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility.","Many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law.","The chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately.","And even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered.","\"We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,\" said Mr Chiang. \"It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem.\"","Some Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell.","Short-term measures","Ms Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force.","From 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (\u00a3100).","The authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy.","The government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures.","Activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays.","Perhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death."],"targetTitle":"The vet who 'euthanised' herself in Taiwan","targetDescription":"The BBC looks back at the suicide of a vet in Taiwan, as new animal laws are set to come in.","targetKeywords":"","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":222}

For a while now, fans have theorised that the new hero will be called Sombra, but any information further than that has laid out of their grasp.","Well, this new hero isn\u2019t Sombra. Sorry to those who thought it would be. However, don\u2019t be disheartened, as you\u2019re in for a lot of fun. This new hero\u2019s name? Ana. Ana, the kickass heal-sniper.","Ana\u2019s inclusion adds a truly unique set of skills for players to get their hands on. Now, you can hang back away from the heat of the action, but still lend support to those in its midst. You can heal, you can put your enemies to sleep, and also lend traditional fire support as you would as a normal sniper.","Check out the gameplay trailer below for peek at what kind of awesomeness you can expect.","Much like other heroes, Ana comes with a distinct back story to flesh out her character, and it\u2019s a goodie. Turns out she is Pharah\u2019s mother, and was part of a group very similar (if not just an earlier incarnation of) the Overwatch team.","Ana taught Pharah all she knows, which explains why she grew up to be such a badass. She states in her origin video that she didn\u2019t want the same life for Pharah as she\u2019d had, although I\u2019d imagine growing up around a group of heroes would kind of set you on that path regardless.","Ana\u2019s inclusion in the game is a big one, both gameplay and story wise. Looking to the future, it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Ana affects the game\u2019s balance, and just who, or what, else Blizzard has up their sleeve. Maybe Sombra will make an appearance in a future release? Maybe Sombra was just a complete ruse?

Li, an investment analyst from Rockville, Maryland, had tried convincing his son to join him on his trip to China. According to Washington Post, his son declined his offer and told him:","\"Dad, don\u2019t worry about me. I will work hard, and I will be successful, and you will be proud of me.\"","On June 25, 2015, Sam Ellis left a party in North Potomac where he had been drinking and crashed his car into another vehicle that killed Li\u2019s son, Calvin, and a fellow classmate, Alex Murk. Ellis, a one-time star quarterback at Wootton High School, pleaded guilty on two charges of vehicular manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison.","Calvin, an extroverted football player and recent graduate at Wootton High School, had been admitted to the University of Maryland in College Park where he would have attended as a freshman. Friends remember Calvin as a football fanatic who was charismatic, upbeat and funny.","He was the wide receiver No. 7 on his high school football team and once had aspirations of becoming a professional football player. Li recalled crushing his son\u2019s dreams during his middle school years when he told Calvin:","\"Son, you go back to study. You\u2019re not going to be a football player. You are Chinese.\"","That moment would become one of his greatest regrets. Li, a Chinese immigrant who arrived to the United States during his twenties, reflected after his son\u2019s passing:","\"If I knew what I know now, I would\u2019ve been a much better parent.","\"When I look back, I cannot forgive myself. Even though I know maybe in reality he would not be a football player. But it was just the way I shattered his dream when he was small ... And I know for sure, there are other Chinese parents who are doing the same to their children right now. And I don\u2019t want that to happen.\"","Li recognized his son\u2019s struggle to reconcile the dual Chinese and American cultures in which he was raised. As a child, Calvin attended Chinese school on the weekends and excelled in Mandarin. However, as he grew up, Calvin began distancing himself from his parents\u2019 cultural traditions and values.","As a teenager, Calvin strove to be more Americanized and had no interest in eating out at Chinese restaurants with his parents, listening to Chinese news or traveling to Asia. He wanted to break away from the kind of stereotypes that are linked to Asian Americans such as academic excellence in math and science. Li said:","\"So his [Calvin\u2019s] way of doing that was to distance himself from anything Chinese. I felt that\u2019s not the right way of dealing with identity, but at the time I was not aware of this issue. I was not understanding enough to help him. I was just forcefully saying, you know, \u2018You\u2019re a Chinese kid.\u2019\"","Calvin associated with few other Asian students in his social circle and while he maintained good grades, his passion wasn\u2019t academics. Li struggled to understand his son\u2019s avoidance of his cultural heritage and desire to adopt an all-American attitude growing up.","\"Society often thinks, Asian kids \u2014 they\u2019re doing well in school, they\u2019re working hard they tend to be overachievers, they don\u2019t have any problems. But in fact, they do have problems, and many of the problems are overlooked by not only their parents but also by the society.\"","In March, Li established a foundation name for his son and announced that he will be donating $1.2 million over the span of three years for a University of Maryland fellowship. The fellowship will be dedicated to studying the kinds of issues facing the children of Asian American immigrants involving family dynamics, identity formation and cultural gaps.","Janelle Wong, the director of Asian American Studies at University of Maryland, believes such families will benefit from the research findings that will be presented at lectures and community workshops.","(Visited 40,955 times, 1 visits today)"],"targetTitle":"Chinese Father Realizes His Greatest Regret After His Son Dies in Car Accident","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/chinese-parents-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/1-36-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/06\/nextnext.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Screen-Shot-2016-08-24-at-1.31.22-PM-80x80.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/plugins\/user-avatar\/user-avatar-pic.php?src=http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/avatars\/5\/1406934743-bpfull.jpg&w=50&id=5&random=1406934743","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/Screen-Shot-2016-08-24-at-1.31.22-PM-300x180.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/drunk-driving-car-crash2.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/armless5-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/steph-murphy-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/drunk-driving-car-crash4.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/poor1-e1488592762358-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/liveanimalkeychains-80x80.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/team-usa-rio-olympics-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/poor1-e1488592762358-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-6.17.00-PM-80x80.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/A-11-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/drunk-driving-car-crash3.jpeg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/seoul-1510336_960_720-e1488591439350-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/team-usa-rio-olympics-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/palawan-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/liveanimalkeychains-300x180.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/02\/logo-flex-footer.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/Screen-Shot-2016-09-06-at-6.17.00-PM-300x180.png","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/seoul-1510336_960_720-e1488591439350-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/A-11-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/drunk-driving-car-crash1.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/11\/steph-murphy-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/palawan-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/chinese-parents-80x80.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/niceguys-e1452799836423.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/03\/armless5-300x180.jpg","http:\/\/nextshark.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/09\/1-36-300x180.jpg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/nextshark.com\/paul-li-calbin-li-drunk-driving-accident\/","id":234}

The Nelson Mandela and the Boston bombing dominated various lists alongside the search for \"What is twerking?\" As for most-searched people of 2013, Miley's favorite activity landed her atop a somewhat predictable list.","Here are the top 10:","1. Miley Cyrus","Miley likely ranked the highest on Google's list because of twerking. She spent 2013 breaking off an engagement, smoking a blunt on stage (at the EMAS), and swinging around on a wrecking ball, naked and crying. You probably missed a lot of important news while all that was happening.","2. Drake","Drake is a surprise at second place, especially on a list that also contains the name \"Beyonce.\" Although, the year wasn't without accomplishments for the rapper. He helped Beyonce with \"Beyonce,\" briefly starred in \"Anchorman 2\" and received multiple Grammy nods (despite not showing up for the nominations concert).","3. Kim Kardashian","Kim Kardashian is almost constantly the subject of rumors -- the most recent of which alleges she waxed North West's eyebrows. On top of the usual obsession with her every move, the woman who is famous for being famous had a baby, received an enormous engagement ring via Jumbotron proposal and made the shockingly unsurprising decision to televise yet another wedding.","4. Justin Bieber","Le petit Canadian has been spitting all over the place since early January. He abandoned his pet monkey in Germany, said he hoped Anne Frank \"would have been a Belieber\" and peed in a bucket while insulting a former president. In any case, all of of his antics seem to have tired him out: he announced Dec. 18 that he's \"retiring.\"","5. Beyonce","At number one on Bing's list, Bey surprisingly came in only midway down Google's results. Of all the Bey moments of 2013, the most surprising \/ awesome \/ life-changing thing was obviously her surprise visual album (which quickly sold over one million albums and rose to No. 1). The Queen of the Universe doesn't need salacious headlines to keep you talking.","6. Rihanna","Rihanna made waves when she wore a doobie wrap to the AMAs, at which her mother presented her with the honor of the first-ever Icon Award. The Barbadian also spent 2013 posting various Instagrams of her butt that seemed to culminate in her controversial \"Pour It Up\" video, featuring a denim thong.","7. Taylor Swift","America's most famous jam maker faked surprised over a lot of awards in 2013. Earlier in the year, she said some definitely not endearing things about there being a \"special place in hell\" for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, but the 24-year-old was able to make amends by a PR repair that including leaving a very sizable tip and inviting Lorde to her birthday party.","8. Selena Gomez","In 2013, Selena Gomez conducted her \"Stars Dance\" tour after ending things with petit Canadian Justin Bieber. Her personal life also included a scuffle with Lorde, an enduring friendship with with Taylor Swift and lots of short shorts. Gomez briefly came under fire for her MTV movie awards performance, which included the inappropriate use of a bindi as an accessory.","9.

Google\u2019s now-banned interview questions have become the stuff of Internet folklore. But now, a former interviewee of Microsoft has revealed a question he was asked after applying for a job at the multi-billion dollar company. According to his story, their selection process is no more forgiving than Google's.","Prashant Bagdia posted on the website Quora the story of his friend who went for a job interview at Microsoft. For the last question, the interviewer asked: \"A right triangle has a hypotenuse equal to 10 and an altitude to the hypotenuse equal to 6. Find the area of the triangle.\"","Partly wondering why a software employer would be interested in a high school geometry question and partly wondering if this was a trick, the interviewee finally managed to piece together an answer he thought was correct, saying: \"Sir, as area of any triangle is 0.5*base*height, the answer to this question would be 0.5 *10*6 which evaluates to 30!\"","But his confident response was shut down by the interviewer.

{"postId":"790154060259295232","postText":["This is the difference between a job and a calling"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["I\u2019ve learned that work is most fulfilling when it\u2019s a calling. And often, it\u2019s a calling because you find a deep sense of purpose and positive impact in your role. And fortunately, the data show that purpose is incredibly tied to both business and personal success. In Corporate Culture and Performance, authors John Kotter and James Heskett write that purposeful, value-based companies outperform their counterparts with 400% higher revenues, 700% greater job growth and 1,200% higher stock prices. But having purpose doesn\u2019t only impact the organization you work for; it also impacts you. Research from the Hay Group shows that highly engaged employees are, on average, 50% more likely to exceed expectations than their least engaged counterparts. As a result, I believe that, to be both successful and fulfilled, it is crucial to understand what purpose means to you.","Granted, finding your purpose is a proactive pursuit. Many people start to explore their feelings when they\u2019re unhappy, dissatisfied with their job and\/or upset with their personal life. But it is important to find time to reflect when you find yourself in a good place, too. When you\u2019re experiencing fulfillment and joy in your work or in your personal life, take a moment to ask yourself, \"What am I doing right now that is making me fulfilled?\" Are you helping someone? Are you coding? Are you being creative? Are you creating the best financial model the world has ever seen? The answers to this question often bring to the surface what is important to you and can help you recreate that satisfaction moving forward.","I\u2019ve also found it helpful to create a personal vision for your life. Spend some time thinking about what your ideal day would be like. I keep a \"dream book\" myself, and I\u2019ve filled it with things that are important to me\u2014from building a great tech company that is tackling a hard but important problem to building and maintaining lifelong friendships to checking items off of my travel bucket list. It even includes a picture of a well-landscaped backyard because that\u2019s been on my list of projects to tackle\u2014and trust me, you need vision to see beyond the weeds that are back there today.","So spend time creating a vision for your life. Ask yourself key questions about the role that purpose will play. Trust me, your vision can and will change over time. But knowing what you want your life to look like and then working to establish annual, monthly or even daily goals and habits to help you live that life\u2014in and out of the workplace\u2014is absolutely key to success. And more importantly, it is absolutely key to finding your passion for life."],"targetTitle":"The Difference Between a Job and a Calling","targetDescription":"You should start before you begin to feel unhappy in your work","targetKeywords":"purpose, finding, career, calling, career option, best career, find career, find calling, career calling","targetMedia":["https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/work-office.jpg?quality=85&w=600&h=336&crop=1","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/megan-markle.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1","http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/woman-emails-signature.jpg?crop=0px%2C410px%2C7360px%2C4140px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/04\/work-office.jpg?quality=85&w=940&h=528&crop=1","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/breast-cancer-surgery-masectomy.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/lindsey-vonn-body-confidence.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1","http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/kim-kardashian-lip-ring.jpg?crop=2px%2C136px%2C1266px%2C710px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1","http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/natalie-portman-benjamin-millipied.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C2100px%2C1180px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1","http:\/\/ti.me\/images\/motto-logo.jpg","http:\/\/i0.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/clean-eating-tips-bacon.jpg?crop=0px%2C270px%2C5111px%2C2874px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1","http:\/\/i2.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/janusz-korwin-mikke.jpg?crop=0px%2C490px%2C2270px%2C1276px&resize=300%2C168&quality=85&strip&ssl=1","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/12\/gettyimages-611183146.jpg?quality=85&w=300&h=168&crop=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/ti.me\/2eCJV3W","id":242}

Both Rey and Palpatine are the only two characters in the Star Wars universe who use this forward-thrust move.","This mirroring is equally powerful when you realise the first move we see each of them perform is this forward thrust.","Rey's first lightsaber battle has several other visual references to Palpatine's fighting style, almost too many to be coincidental.","This cyclical referencing also works in the sense that the earlier films have followed a pattern of Skywalker vs Palpatine tension. In The Force Awakens, if Rey's parentage does stem from Palpatine, her battle against Kylo Ren continues the Skywalker\/Palpatine tension, flipping the dark and light sides. For now.","That's because Rey is already struggling with the pull of the dark side. While every fledgling Jedi struggles between the pull of light and dark, there are moments during The Force Awakens that point to Rey being tempted to the dark.","In the film's script, it describes Rey as \"standing on the edge of the dark side\".","During Rey's vision, Palpatine can be heard several times.","Right before the hallway collapses on her, you can hear Palpatine's scream, and further along, there's audio of Palpatine saying \"any Jedi\". There are a few other audio snippets included (Luke, Obi-Wan, and Yoda to name a few) but Palpatine's inclusion seems like an outlier when you consider Luke's lightsaber is the trigger for the vision. Why else would ol' Palps show up, if not because of some kind of relationship to Rey?","The notion of hiding in plain sight comes into play when you consider the poster for The Force Awakens.","In the portrait form, Rey's strategic placement puts her between the dark and light sides in the most literal sense.","But when expanded out, Rey is placed toward the dark side, hanging with Kylo Ren, her staff aligned with his lightsaber to almost seem as if they're one.","Finally, what about the accent? A lot of people used Rey's British accent as evidence that she could be a Kenobi, but guess who else had a fancy posh accent. Yep.

One tree was in Finland and the other in Austria, and both were monitored from dusk until morning on dry, windless nights in September. This was close to the solar equinox, when daylight and nighttime are about equal. [What Is the Oldest Tree in the World?]","The laser scanners used infrared light to illuminate different parts of the tree, each for fractions of a second. This provided enough detail to map each tree within minutes, the researchers said.","The silver birches' branches and leaves sagged at night; they reached their lowest position a few hours before sunrise, and then perked up again during the wee hours of the morning, the researchers found.","Trees might sleep after dark, according to precise laser measurements that detected the plants' branches drooping at night. Credit: Eetu Puttonen","\"Our results show that the whole tree droops during night, which can be seen as position change in leaves and branches,\" study lead author Eetu Puttonen, a researcher at the Finnish Geospatial Research Institute, said in a statement. \"The changes are not too large, only up to 10 centimeters [4 inches] for trees with a height of about 5 meters [16 feet].\"","It's unclear if the sun \"woke up\" the trees or if they relied on their own internal circadian rhythm, the researchers said. But \"the fact that some branches started returning to their daytime position already before sunrise would suggest this [internal circadian clock] hypothesis [is right],\" the researchers wrote in the study, which was published online on Feb. 29, 2016, in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science.","The finding isn't too surprising, but oddly enough it hadn't been studied until now, the researchers said. Most living organisms have day and night circadian rhythms, and any gardener will notice that some plants open their flowers in the morning and that some trees close their leaves at night, the researchers said.","The famed botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) found that flowers confined to a dark cellar still opened and closed, and naturalist Charles Darwin (1809-1882) noted that the nocturnal movement of leaves and stalks on plants looked like sleep.","However, their studies concentrated on small plants grown in pots. The finding in trees represents the first study to use lasers to precisely measure the nighttime movements of wild trees, the researchers said.","The tree study didn't address why the branches and leaves drooped at night, but it's likely related to the turgidity, or the internal water pressure within the tree, the researchers said.","\"Plant movement is always closely connected with the water balance of individual cells, which is affected by the availability of light through photosynthesis,\" said study co-author Andra\u0301s Zlinszky, a researcher at the Centre for Ecological Research at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. [How Tall Can Trees Grow?]","The researchers said in the future, they plan to examine the water movement within each tree and compare it to measurements made by the laser scans. \"This will give us a better understanding of the trees' daily tree water use and their influence on the local or regional climate,\" Puttonen said."],"targetTitle":"Do Trees Sleep at Night?","targetDescription":"Trees might catch some shut-eye during the wee hours of the night, a new study finds.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/images\/i\/000\/083\/640\/original\/trees-night.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&fit=inside|660:*","http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/images\/i\/000\/083\/640\/original\/trees-night.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&downsize=*:1000","http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/resources\/img\/purch-logo.png?b1c7afc","http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/images\/i\/partners\/3\/original\/lifeslittle.jpeg?1457110210"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/54864-do-trees-sleep.html","id":250}

The complaints allege that its upstart rival's cameras can lose about 5 frames per minute. The suits come two weeks after Vievu sued Taser on the claim that the company had illegally lobbied officials in the city of Phoenix to abandon a $3.6 million camera contract that Vievu had recently won.","The body-camera war has also included skirmishes in New York City, where Vievu's win of a $6.4 million body camera contract sparked similar accusations about the quality of its products and a fierce lobbying campaign by Taser. Last month, amid questions over the contract, the tussle led Mayor Bill de Blasio to complain of a \"smear\" campaign against Vievu.","In a statement to Fast Company in response to Taser's new lawsuits, John Collins, a Vievu spokesman, said the company \"believes in its cameras and technology, and looks forward to a full discovery process in which the public can see Taser's underhanded tactics in full view.\"","Taser, the market leader, has denied any wrongdoing, insisting that its cameras are simply superior to its rivals. And as it develops its software and cloud storage ecosystem for video, the company is also determined to be known as an innovator. As CEO and cofounder Rick Smith explained to me, the technology vision is much bigger than hardware: The coming generation of cameras will be bolstered by live-streaming, object and face recognition, and artificial intelligence.","[Image: Vievu] AP"],"targetTitle":"Because of Brexit, Berlin is now likely to become Europe\u2019s startup capital","targetDescription":"The days of London being the startup capital of Europe are probably over due to Brexit, reports Geektime.\n    The thing that","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["data:image\/png;base64,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","https:\/\/grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net\/b\/ss\/gjincfastcoprod\/1\/H.24.4--NS\/0\/5658306","https:\/\/res.cloudinary.com\/fast-company\/image\/upload\/v1467020383\/fastconews\/gr0ozwthfqbfy2x7ulv9.jpg","https:\/\/fast-company-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1487794962\/fcweb\/o0kfkgeql6swiiog2lga.jpg","https:\/\/a.fastcompany.net\/asset_files\/-\/2016\/07\/11\/fastcompany-logo.svg"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/news.fastcompany.com\/because-of-brexit-berlin-is-now-likely-to-become-europes-startup-capital-4011874?utm_content=buffer560e6&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer","id":252}

But the bank\u2019s real treasures aren\u2019t in some vault, they\u2019re in plain sight\u2014the ADB canteen offers scrumptious meals from several Asian cuisines at affordable prices, as well as a bakery that serves up all kinds of breads, pies, and pastries.","While the bibimbap, tempura bento, and walnut pie might all be worth breaking and entering for, the real crown jewels of the ADB canteen are the chocolate crinkles baked in-house daily. You hear about them\u2014the cookies in that really strict building. They've become a legend on their own, and out of reach. And just like clockwork, a queue forms every day at mid-afternoon for these hockey pucks from heaven.","Time your appointment just right and fall in line for the chocolate crinkles (P14\/piece). While you\u2019re at it, pick up some brewed coffee at just P11 (bring your own tumbler or shell out P10 for a paper cup!) and take your double handful of happiness out to a bench in the courtyard.","For the price, these crinkles are huge\u2014each one is three inches in diameter and half an inch thick, with considerable heft to it. Pull a crinkle apart\u2014it\u2019s very dense, and very moist.

Spiritual but not religious .","These are all words and phrases that have come to be associated with the \"Milliennial Generation,\" which is also sometimes referred to as Generation Y. Recently, however, two additional adjectives have worked their way into the Millennial description pool: stressed and sleepless .","The correlation between stress and sleep deprivation is becoming increasingly apparent in American society. NPR maintains that 60 million Americans are currently battling insomnia.","According to an American Psychological Association study titled Stress in America , more than 50 percent of Millennials report to having been kept awake at least one night over the course of the past month due to stress. This is comparable to only 37 percent of Baby Boomers and 25 percent of Matures.","Why does stress affect sleep? Stress is widely recognized as the body\u2019s response to potentially harmful situations, whether real or imagined. Although the effects of stress most certainly vary from person to person, general reactions include quickened breathing, tightened muscles, spiked blood pressure, and an increased heart rate.","Fight or Flight or... Sleep?","These are, in short, all individual components of the body\u2019s intrinsic and universally acknowledged \"fight-or-flight\" response. Many stressed out people have trouble falling asleep because they feel the weight of these symptoms most heavily at night.","Best-selling author Dr. Andrew Weil, who received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1968, is a huge advocate of the benefits of holistic breathing practices in combatting stress and anxiety. On his website , Dr. Weil writes:","\"Breathing strongly influences physiology and thought processes, including moods. By simply focusing your attention on your breathing, and without doing anything to change it, you can move in the direction of relaxation.\"","Because the effects of stress include quick and shallow breaths that stem almost exclusively from the upper chest, perpetually stressed and anxious people are actually in the detrimental habit of under-breathing. Many stressed people are even known for subconsciously holding their breath.","That being said, mindful breathing practices are noticeably absent from the vast majority of Western medicine. Those most familiar with the relationship between breathing and the body tend to be yogis and practitioners of Eastern wellness methodologies.","How to Do The \"4-7-8\u2032\u2032 Exercise","Dr. Weil is an influential public supporter of a previously little-known breathing technique known as the \"4-7-8 exercise.\" This trick, which began to capture national attention several years ago and has since been the subject of innumerable headlines, including one on Oprah.com , is shockingly simple, takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere.","Here is how you do the exercise:","Place the tip of your tongue against the tissue ridge right above your upper front teeth. Keep it there for the remainder of the exercise. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound as you do so. Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight. Make the same whoosh sound from Step Two. This concludes the first cycle. Repeat the same process three more times for a total of four renditions.","In a nutshell: breathe in for four, hold for seven, and breathe out for eight. You must inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth. The four-count inhale allows chronic under-breathers to take in more oxygen. The seven-count hold gives the oxygen more time to thoroughly permeate the bloodstream, and the eight-count exhale slows the heart rate and releases a greater amount of carbon dioxide from the lungs.","Alina Gonzalez, who wrote \" How I Learned to Fall Asleep in Under 1 Minute \" for Byrdie.com, says that 4-7-8 helped her fall asleep amid her nerves and severe anxiety the week before she was scheduled to give the bridesmaid speech at her best friend\u2019s wedding.","When Gonzalez told her friend that she was having trouble getting to sleep due to a combination of stress and pre-wedding jitters, the bride-to-be, who was a licensed wellness practitioner, told her that the 4-7-8 technique would change her life. It did. Like so many others who swear by this method, the originally skeptical Gonzalez wakes up each morning to the incredulous realization that s he does not even remember completing the final 4-7-8 cycle because it put her to sleep so quickly.","The 4-7-8 exercise certainly has the potential to help overly stressed, anxiety-ridden Millennials (as well as members of the general population at large) fall asleep more quickly. It is also known to have positive effects when implemented throughout the day during times of stress, anger, guilt, frustration, or internal tension. When weighing the painlessness of this completely free method against the irritability, headaches, distractedness, impaired cognitive skills, weight gain, and even heart disease that can result from the \"performance killer\" known as sleep deprivation, it seems worth a shot."],"targetTitle":"How to Fall Asleep in Under a Minute","targetDescription":"The simple method takes hardly any time, and can be done pretty much anywhere","targetKeywords":"#howto, #lifehack, health, psychology, sleep","targetMedia":["https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/you-asked-juice-cleanse1.jpg?quality=85&w=405","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/you-asked-whiten-teeth1.jpg?quality=85&w=838","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/you-asked-juice-cleanse1.jpg?quality=85&w=838","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/sleeping.jpg?w=720","https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/03\/you-asked-is-dessert-bad-for-me1.jpg?quality=85&w=838"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/time.com\/3841758\/fall-asleep-under-one-minute\/","id":254}

{"postId":"4lyzw6","postText":["Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?","An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players.","By Kate Wheeling","Then-Baylor head coach Art Briles looks on from the sidelines. (Photo: Ron Jenkins\/Getty Images)","Last week, Kenneth W. Starr was stripped of his title as president of Baylor University after an independent investigation found that the university had mishandled sexual assault accusations against football players. Football head coach Art Briles was also fired as a result of the investigation. Starr, who will continue to serve as both chancellor and a law professor, gained notoriety as an independent counsel for his investigation of President Bill Clinton, the New York Times reports:","Mr. Starr\u2019s demotion delivered a twist to the biography of a man whose reputation was built on what many considered an overzealous pursuit of allegations of sexual transgressions by Mr. Clinton. Now he is being punished for leading an administration that, according to a report from an ostensibly independent investigator, looked the other way when Baylor football players were accused of sex crimes, and sometimes convicted of them.","The relationship between athletes and sexual assault is a decades-old discussion. Since at least the 1980s, high-profile rape cases involving famous athletes have led the press to speculate on whether players might be more prone to committing acts of sexual violence. A string of sexual assault allegations in recent years has ensured that college athletic programs and the athletes that populate them will remain in the spotlight. In the last two years alone, players from the University of Tennessee-Knoxville, Florida State University, and the University of Oregon have made headlines for assault allegations. More than 160 higher education institutions are under investigation by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Civil Rights for sexual violence allegations. But are athletes actually more likely to commit sexual assaults, or are we just more likely to pay attention when they\u2019re the ones accused of committing the crime?","One factor to consider is that sexual violence does not occur in a vacuum. Anthropological research suggests that, rather than a purely psychological- or biological-driven act, sexual assaults are also highly influenced by culture. Peggy Sanday, an emeritus professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, found that some societies are more prone to rape than others; tribal societies with higher levels of male dominance, sex segregation, and tolerance of interpersonal violence had higher rates of rape. In other words, some environments can encourage sexual aggression.","The recent investigation into Baylor concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"","College athletics are highly sex segregated, extremely male dominated, and, at least in the case of some sports \u2014 football and hockey, for example \u2014 violent by design. While no university could be accused of explicitly encouraging sexual assault, several have been blamed for condoning such behaviors, or sweeping assault allegations under the rug. The recent investigation into Baylor, for example, concluded that university officials \"created a cultural perception that football was above the rules.\"","And the perceived lack of consequences for star athletes might embolden them to behave in sexually aggressive ways. Consider surveys that have found that between one in six and one in three men would be willing to \"use force\" to obtain sex from women as long as there were no consequences for their actions.","While members of sports teams \u2014 and other male-dominated groups like fraternities and the military \u2014 are indeed more likely to commit gang rapes than the average person, there are few conclusive studies to show that athletes are more likely to commit sex crimes. There is some evidence that not all athletes are equally likely to be violent, according to Laura Finley, a sociologist at Barry University. Finley told Wisconsin Public Radio that players of \"power and performance sports\" \u2014 football, hockey, wrestling, and basketball \u2014 commit violent crimes more often that their peers in sports like swimming or tennis. An analysis of National Football League players by Benjamin Morris at FiveThirtyEight showed that, though the football stars displayed lower levels of domestic and sexual violence than the national average, the rate of domestic violence was still much higher than expected given their income bracket.","Without better data, it\u2019s hard to say anything definitive on the matter. Even the oft-cited statistic that one in three sexual assaults on college campuses are carried out by athletes dates back not to a scientific study, but to a 1986 Philadelphia Daily News article. (One 1995 study did, however, find that male athletes were overrepresented in reports of sexual assault on campuses.) Literature reviews, which are usually useful for identifying patterns in the sea of conflicting single studies that science produces, are also unreliable here: One recent review found that the bulk of research on the subject was inconclusive; another, however, found higher rates of violence among student athletes.","We can at least say with certainty that universities have not been effective in handling the cases of sexual misconduct by athletes. A 2014 survey found that, in more than one-fifth of universities, the athletic department oversaw cases involving sexual assault allegations against athletes, prompting the National Collegiate Athletic Association to issue a resolution that athletic departments can only participate in, but never lead, investigations into such allegations. Still, the recent investigation at Baylor found that the university\u2019s football program frequently dealt with sexual assault allegations internally."],"targetTitle":"Are Student Athletes More Likely to Commit Sexual Assault?","targetDescription":"An investigation found that Baylor University had mishandled sexual assault accusations against its football players.

When you have excess fat around your pubic area and stomach, it could make your penis seem smaller. \"If you lose weight, you can actually gain an inch or two because the [pubic] fat would be less,\" says Fisch.","So if you've noticed a little extra weight around that area, losing a few might come with the added bonus of looking bigger where you actually want to. If you're not sure where to start, check out our Clean Eating Challenge and our 28-Day Get Fit Challenge for some inspiration.","Another way to look bigger: Trim your pubic hair.","Again, not a trick, just an aesthetic truth. Cutting back the hedges will make your penis look longer. Obviously, pubic hair grooming is a personal preference, but if you\u2019re goal is to be bigger, this seems way less painful than some shady penile extender you can buy off the internet.","Then make sure your boner is at maximum capacity... because, it might not be.","\"Whatever your maximal length or girth is, you can\u2019t get it bigger than that,\" says Fisch. \"However, a lot of men don\u2019t meet their potential.\"","That\u2019s usually because they\u2019re not getting enough blood flow to the penis, which could be the result of being overweight, smoking, increased cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. So the first step in your penis-growing experiment should be to get the rest of your body healthy \u2014 especially your cardiovascular system. \"What\u2019s good for the heart is good for the penis,\" says Fisch.","And OK, yes, there are some pills you can take.","Obviously erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra and Cialis are the most common. While they won\u2019t necessarily add inches, they do increase blood flow to the penis. So if you\u2019re not getting a firm erection on your own, these can help you hit your peak penis length. Talk to your doctor if you think you could benefit from a prescription.","Supplements can also help, like antioxidants to increase your vascular health or l-arginine to increase nitric oxide and blood flow \u2014 both of which can lead to stronger boners, says Fisch.","It's worth noting here that if you're having problems getting or maintaining an erection, or if your erections just aren't what they used to be, that could be a sign of a bigger health issue, like heart disease. Definitely talk to your doctor if you're experiencing problems like this. Don't just borrow a few pills from your friend's Viagra Rx.","ALL THAT BEING SAID, you really shouldn\u2019t worry so much about your size anyway. Seriously.","First of all, if you're feeling ill-equipped after watching porn \u2014 stop comparing your goods to a porn star's. The average erect penis is 5.4 inches, and most men fall within an inch of that, says Fisch. Chances are, you're actually pretty close to average.","And if you're worrying about your size pleasing your partner, remember that penetration is just one part of sex, and everyone's preferences are different. Many women don't even orgasm from penile-vaginal sex, for instance, and other people don't care very much about size or length. The size of your penis could possibly be unrelated entirely to your partner's ability to experience pleasure.","Now, let\u2019s have an honest conversation about those who do have a smaller than average penis.","Sure, you may encounter partners who may be turned off by that, as with any physical or sexual preference. But you\u2019ll also find partners who are turned on by it, or who don\u2019t care either way. It\u2019s all about finding the right sexual compatibility with the right partner \u2014 and that might include adding more oral stimulation, manual stimulation, sex toys, and so on. It's 100% entirely possible to have an amazing sex life with any size penis (or, you know, none at all).","Bottom line: You can't magically grow a bigger penis... and that's OK.","Yes, you can make some small health and aesthetic tweaks to have the biggest and hardest penis that's physically possible for you. But in the end, the best thing you can do for yourself is to worry less about size, and instead focus on finding a partner who you're sexually compatible with.'"],"targetTitle":"Here\u2019s How To

{"postId":"4v8ljp","postText":["Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Some of my Christian friends tell me they can\u2019t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between \"the lesser of two evils,\" the morally right thing is to choose neither one. They recommend voting for a third-party or write-in candidate.","As a professor who has taught Christian ethics for 39 years, I think their analysis is incorrect. Now that Trump has won the GOP nomination, I think voting for Trump is a morally good choice.","American citizens need patience with each other in this difficult political season. Close friends are inevitably going to make different decisions about the election. We still need to respect each other and thank God that we live in a democracy with freedom to differ about politics. And we need to keep talking with each other \u2013 because democracies function best when thoughtful citizens can calmly and patiently dialog about the reasons for their differences. This is my contribution to that discussion.","A good candidate with flaws","I do not think that voting for Donald Trump is a morally evil choice because there is nothing morally wrong with voting for a flawed candidate if you think he will do more good for the nation than his opponent. In fact, it is the morally right thing to do.","I did not support Trump in the primary season. I even spoke against him at a pastors\u2019 conference in February. But now I plan to vote for him. I do not think it is right to call him an \"evil candidate.\" I think rather he is a good candidate with flaws.","He is egotistical, bombastic, and brash. He often lacks nuance in his statements. Sometimes he blurts out mistaken ideas (such as bombing the families of terrorists) that he later must abandon. He insults people. He can be vindictive when people attack him. He has been slow to disown and rebuke the wrongful words and actions of some angry fringe supporters. He has been married three times and claims to have been unfaithful in his marriages. These are certainly flaws, but I don\u2019t think they are disqualifying flaws in this election.","On the other hand, I think some of the accusations hurled against him are unjustified. His many years of business conduct show that he is not racist or anti-(legal) immigrant or anti-Semitic or misogynistic \u2013 I think these are unjust magnifications by a hostile press exaggerating some careless statements he has made. I think he is deeply patriotic and sincerely wants the best for the country. He has been an unusually successful problem solver in business. He has raised remarkable children. Many who have known him personally speak highly of his kindness, thoughtfulness, and generosity. But the main reason I call him \"a good candidate with flaws\" is that I think most of the policies he supports are those that will do the most good for the nation.","Seek the good of the nation","Should Christians even try to influence elections at all? Yes, definitely. The apostle Peter says Christians are \"exiles\" on this earth (1 Peter 1:1). Therefore I take seriously the prophet Jeremiah\u2019s exhortation to the Jewish people living in exile in Babylon:","\"Seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the LORD on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare\" (Jeremiah 29:7).","By way of modern application, I think Christians today have a similar obligation to vote in such a way that will \"seek the welfare\" of the United States. Therefore the one overriding question to ask is this: Which vote is most likely to bring the best results for the nation?","If this election is close (which seems likely), then if someone votes for a write-in candidate instead of voting for Trump, this action will directly help Hillary Clinton, because she will need one less vote to win. Therefore the question that Christians should ask is this: Can I in good conscience act in a way that helps a liberal like Hillary Clinton win the presidency?","Under President Obama, a liberal federal government has seized more and more control over our lives. But this can change. This year we have an unusual opportunity to defeat Hillary Clinton and the pro-abortion, pro-gender-confusion, anti-religious liberty, tax-and-spend, big government liberalism that she champions. I believe that defeating that kind of liberalism would be a morally right action. Therefore I feel the force of the words of James: \"Whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin\" (James 4:17).","Some may feel it is easier just to stay away from this messy Trump-Clinton election, and perhaps not even vote. But the teachings of Scripture do not allow us to escape moral responsibility by saying that we decided to do nothing. The prophet Obadiah rebuked the people of the Edom for standing by and doing nothing to help when the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem: \"On the day that you stood aloof, on the day that . . . foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for Jerusalem, you were like one of them.\" (Obadiah 1:11).","I am writing this article because I doubt that many \"I can\u2019t vote for Trump\" Christians have understood what an entirely different nation would result from Hillary Clinton as president, or have analyzed in detail how different a Trump presidency would be. In what follows, I will compare the results we could expect from a Clinton presidency with what we could expect from a Trump presidency.","The Supreme Court with Clinton as president","Hillary Clinton would quickly replace Justice Scalia with another liberal like Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan. This would give liberals a 5-4 majority on the Supreme Court even without Justice Kennedy, and 6-3 when he votes with them.","But that is not all. Justice Ginsburg is 83, and she has had colon cancer, pancreatic cancer, and has a heart stent. Justice Kennedy is 80. Justice Breyer is 78. A President Clinton could possibly nominate three or four justices to the Supreme Court, locking in a far-left activist judiciary for perhaps 30 or more years. She could also add dozens of activist judges to federal district courts and courts of appeals, the courts where 99% of federal lawsuits are decided. Judicial tyranny of the type we have seen when abortion rights and same-sex marriage were forced on the nation would gain a permanent triumph.","The nation would no longer be ruled by the people and their elected representatives, but by unelected, unaccountable, activist judges who would dictate from the bench about whatever they were pleased to decree. And there would be nothing in our system of government that anyone could do to stop them.","That is why this election is not just about Hillary Clinton. It is about defeating the far left liberal agenda that any Democratic nominee would champion. Liberal Democrats are now within one Supreme Court justice of their highest goal: gaining permanent control of the nation with a five vote majority on the Supreme Court, and then relentlessly imposing every liberal policy on the nation not through winning elections but through a relentless parade of one Supreme Court decision after another.","Even if Clinton were to drop out of the race (perhaps due to additional shocking email disclosures, for example), our choice in the election would be just the same, because any other Democratic nominee would appoint the same kind of liberal justices to the Court.","Abortion","On abortion, a liberal court would probably find the ban on partial-birth abortion to be unconstitutional (it was upheld by only a 5-4 majority in Gonzalez v. Carhart, 2007). In addition, the court could find an absolute \"right to abortion\" in the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution and then sweep away with one decision most or all of the restrictions on abortion that pro-life advocates worked for tirelessly over the last 43 years, including ultrasound requirements, waiting periods, parental consent requirements, and prohibitions on non-doctors performing abortions.","Voters should not doubt the power of the Supreme Court to abolish all these laws restricting abortions. Think of the power of the Obergefell v. Hodges 5-4 decision in June, 2015. It instantly nullified all the work that thousands of Christians had done over many years in persuading the citizens of 31 states to pass constitutional amendments defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. But no one is campaigning for such laws or amendments anymore, because it would be futile. The Supreme Court has spoken, and therefore the issue is settled in the political system of the United States. We lost \u2013 not at the ballot box, but because we had a liberal Supreme Court that nullified the democratic process regarding the definition of marriage.","So it would certainly be with any efforts to place legal limitations on abortion. Nobody would campaign any more for laws to limit abortions, because any such laws would be unconstitutional. The legislative lobbying work of pro-life advocacy groups would be totally and utterly defeated. Millions of unborn children would continue to die.","Religious liberty","The current liberal agenda often includes suppressing Christian opposition to its views. So a liberal court would increasingly nullify rights of conscience with respect to forced participation in same-sex marriage ceremonies or expressing moral objections to homosexual conduct. Already Christians are being pushed out of many occupations. Florists, bakers, and professional photographers have had their businesses destroyed by large fines for refusal to contribute their artistic talents to a specific event, a same-sex wedding ceremony to which they had moral objections.","Fire Chief Kelvin Cochran in Atlanta was removed from his job because of self-publishing a religious book that briefly mentioned the Bible\u2019s teachings regarding non-marital sexual conduct, including homosexuality, amidst a host of other topics. His situation holds ominous implications for any Christians who hold public sector jobs. In our military services, many high-ranking officers have quietly been forced to resign because they were unwilling to give support to the homosexual agenda.","Mozilla\/Firefox CEO Brendan Eich was pushed out from his own company merely because he had donated money to Proposition 8 in California, supporting marriage between one man and one woman. This event has troubling implications for Christians in any corporate executive role who dare to support a political position contrary to the liberal agenda.","Last year Boston urologist Paul Church, a Harvard Medical School faculty member, lost his hospital privileges at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center because he had expressed concerns about the medical dangers associated with same-sex activity.","Are my predictions about this kind of loss of religious liberty too grim? The three conservative justices still on the Supreme Court expressed similar concerns just last month. The case concerned a Washington pharmacy that has been owned for 70 years by the Stormans family, who are committed Christians. They will likely now be put out of business by the Washington State Pharmacy Board for refusing to dispense an abortion-causing prescription drug. On June 28, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to hear the Stormans\u2019 appeal, in spite of the strong dissent written by Justice Alito (joined by Roberts and Thomas):","\"At issue are Washington State regulations that are likely to make a pharmacist unemployable if he or she objects on religious grounds to dispensing certain prescription medications. . . . . there is much evidence that the impetus for the adoption of the regulations was hostility to pharmacists whose religious beliefs regarding abortion and contraception are out of step with prevailing opinion in the State . . . . If this is a sign of how religious liberty claims will be treated in the years ahead, those who value religious freedom have cause for great concern.\" (italics added)","Christian business owners","If Clinton appoints just one more liberal justice, it is likely that many Christian business owners will be targeted. Hobby Lobby won its 2014 Supreme Court case (again 5-4), so it was not compelled to dispense abortifacients to its employees, but that case could be reversed (the four liberal justices in the minority, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, are still on the court). If that case is overturned, it would force Hobby Lobby out of business, because the Green family had said they would shut down the company of 23,000 employees and over $3 billion in annual sales if they lost the decision. The implications for other Christian business owners with pro-life convictions are ominous.","These incidents show that it is not an exaggeration to say that, under a liberal Supreme Court resulting from Hillary Clinton\u2019s election, Christians would increasingly experience systematic exclusion from hundreds of occupations, with thousands of people losing their jobs. Step-by-step, Christians would increasingly be marginalized to the silent fringes of society. Is withholding a vote from Donald Trump important enough to pay this high a price in loss of freedom?","Some Christians have even hinted to me that \"persecution would be good for us.\" But the Bible never encourages us to seek persecution or hope for it. We should rather work to prevent such oppression of Christians, just as Jesus taught us to pray, \"Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil\" (Matthew 6:13). Paul did not encourage us to pray that God would give us bad rulers but good ones who would allow us to live a peaceful life:","\"I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, 2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.\" (1Timothy 2:1)","Christian schools and colleges","A liberal Supreme Court would also impact education. Christian colleges would likely be found guilty of \"discrimination\" if they required adherence to the Bible\u2019s standards regarding sexual conduct, or even required affirmation of primary Christian beliefs. Campus ministries like Cru and InterVarsity have already been forced off of many university campuses following the 5-4 Supreme Court decision CLS v. Martinez (2010), which upheld the exclusion of the Christian Legal Society from the campus of Hastings College of Law in San Francisco. And now California\u2019s Equity in Higher Education Act (SB 1146), which recently passed the California state senate and will likely become law, would prohibit Christian colleges from requiring students or employees to hold Christian beliefs or abide by biblical moral standards regarding sexual conduct, and would prohibit colleges from assigning housing based on a student\u2019s biological sex if a student claimed to be transgender. Colleges like Biola and Azusa Pacific could not long survive under those regulations.","With regard to elementary and high schools, laws promoting school choice or tuition voucher programs would likely be declared unconstitutional if they allowed such funding to go to Christian schools. A tax credit program for scholarships to private schools, including Christian institutions, was only upheld by a 5-4 Supreme Court decision in Arizona Christian School Tuition Organization v. Winn in 2011, and all four liberal justices who voted against it are still on the court. Another possible target of the liberal agenda would be laws that allow for home schooling, if the secular\/ liberal governmental hostility to home schooling in European countries is any indicator.","Churches","Churches would not be exempt from the impact of a liberal Supreme Court. The court could rule that any school district is allowed to ban churches from renting school buildings on Sundays, an action that could severely hinder the work of small churches and church planting in general. (This was already the ruling of the Second Circuit in the Bronx Household of Faith case regarding New York City public schools.) And some churches in Iowa have now been told that they have to make their bathrooms open to people on the basis of their \"gender identity\" if the churches are going to be open to the public at all.","Freedom of speech","Freedom of speech would be increasingly restricted in the public square. In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that prayers of visiting pastors who prayed \"in Jesus\u2019 name\" when they opened a city council meeting were allowed under the Constitution, but again it was a 5-4 decision (Town of Greece v. Galloway) and all four liberals who wanted to restrict such prayers are still on the court.","Criminalizing dissent","Another troubling possibility is that liberal activists, once in power, would further entrench themselves by criminalizing much political dissent. We have already seen it happen with the IRS targeting of conservative groups and with some state attorneys general taking steps to prosecute (!) groups who dare to disagree with activists\u2019 claims about the danger of man-made global warming.","\"But my conscience won\u2019t let me vote for Donald Trump,\" some have told me. But I wonder if their consciences have considered the gravity of these destructive consequences that would come from a Clinton presidency. A vote for Trump would at least be doing something to prevent these things.","In addition, I think there are several positive reasons to vote for Trump.","The Supreme Court with Trump as president","Trump has released a list of 11 judges to show the kind of nominee he would appoint to the Supreme Court. A lawyer familiar with many of these names has told me that they constitute a \"dream list\" of outstanding judges who would uphold the original meaning of the Constitution and would not create new laws from the bench. Trump has said he would rely primarily on advice from the Federalist Society, the organization that promotes the \"original meaning\" view so strongly exemplified by Justice Scalia before his death.","If Trump would appoint a replacement for Scalia from his list of 11, and probably one or two other Supreme Court justices, then we could see a 5-4 or even 6-3 majority of conservative justices on the Supreme Court. The results for the nation would be overwhelmingly good.","Such a Supreme Court would finally return control of the nation to the people and their elected representatives, removing it from dictatorial judges who repeatedly make law from the bench.","Abortion","Such a court would likely overturn Roe v. Wade and return abortion laws and the regulation of abortion to the states.","Religious liberty","A conservative court would vigorously uphold the First Amendment, protecting freedom of religion and freedom of speech for Christian colleges, Christian ministries, and churches.","Such a court would likely overturn the horribly destructive decision in Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971) that changed the meaning of the First Amendment and ruled that a government action \"must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion\" (note: not a specific denomination but \"religion\" in general). A conservative court would likely declare that the First Amendment was only intended to prohibit the establishment of a state-sponsored church or denomination.","Such a decision would once again allow the nonsectarian affirmation of personal belief in God in public schools, would once again allow coaches to pray with their football teams before a game, and would allow visiting clergy to be invited to give a prayer at high school graduation ceremonies. It would also imply that nativity scenes without Santa Claus and Buddha should be allowed in government-owned parks and buildings at Christmas time. It wouldn\u2019t require these things, but would allow them if local officials chose to approve them. It would restore true freedom of religion as the First Amendment intended.","It would also protect freedom of conscience for Christians who object to participating in abortions, or dispensing abortifacient medicines, or who do not wish to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies. It is also possible that a conservative Supreme Court would eventually return control of marriage to the states.","Freedom for Christian influence in politics","Significantly, Trump has pledged to work to repeal the 1954 Johnson Amendment to the IRS code, which has been used for 62 years as a threat to silence pastors from speaking about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status. This would be a great victory for freedom of religion and freedom of speech.","In short, a Trump-appointed Supreme Court, together with dozens of lower court judges appointed by him, would probably result in significant advances in many of the policy areas important to Christians. It would also open the door to huge expansion of influence for the many Christian lobbying groups known as \"family policy councils\" in various states, especially enabling them to work for further legal protections for life, for marriage and family, and for religious liberty.","How can we know that Trump won\u2019t change his mind?","\"But Trump has changed his mind in the past,\" a politically-minded friend said to me. \"How do you know that he will do what he has promised? Maybe he\u2019ll betray you and appoint a liberal Supreme Court justice.\"","My reply is that we can never know the future conduct of any human being with 100% certainty, but in making an ethical decision like this one, we should base the decision on the most likely results. In this case, the most likely result is that Trump will do most or all of what he has said.","In the history of American politics, candidates who have been elected president have occasionally changed their minds on one or another issue while in office, but no president has ever gone back on most of what he has promised to do, especially on issues that are crucially important in the election. In this election, it is reasonable to think that the most likely result is that both Trump and Clinton will do what they have promised to do. That is the basis on which we should decide how to vote.","And notice how Trump has changed his mind. He continues to move in a more conservative direction, as evidenced by his list of judges and his choice for vice president. Just as he succeeded in business by listening to the best experts to solve each problem, I suspect that he has been learning from the best experts in conservative political thought and has increasingly found that conservative solutions really work. We should applaud these changes.","His choice of Indiana Gov. Mike Pence as his vice presidential running mate is an especially significant indication that he will govern as a conservative. Trump could have picked a moderate but instead picked a lifelong solid conservative who is a thoughtful, gracious policy wizard. Pence is a lawyer and former talk radio host who served 12 years in Congress and had significant congressional leadership positions, so he will be immensely helpful in working with Congress. He is a committed evangelical Christian. He is a former board member of the Indiana Family Institute, a conservative Christian lobbying group in Indiana.","However, the Supreme Court is not the only issue at stake in this election. While I disagree with Trump on a few things (especially trade policy), on most important issues, Trump will likely do much good for the nation.","Taxes and jobs","Trump has pledged to cut taxes significantly, while Clinton wants to raise them. Trump is advocating a 15% tax rate for corporations rather than the current 35%. Lower corporate taxes would lead to business expansion and a massive increase in available jobs and higher pay levels. For individual taxpayers, Trump favors a top rate of 25%, but for Clinton it\u2019s 45%. Most small businesses file under this individual rate, so once again Trump\u2019s lower taxes would result in substantial expansion of businesses and many more jobs. Finally our economy would snap out of its eight years of anemic growth.","In my judgment, Christians should support lower tax rates that would lead to more jobs, because Obama\u2019s economic policies for the last eight years have hurt lower income and low-middle income families the most. Many can\u2019t even find jobs, and others can\u2019t find full-time jobs. Those who have jobs struggle to survive with no meaningful pay raises year after year. It is no surprise that these are the people who are supporting Trump in overwhelming numbers.","Tax rates are also a good indicator of government control. Higher tax rates mean greater government control of our lives, while lower tax rates indicate greater freedom.","Minorities","Two of the deepest causes of poverty among minority groups and racial tensions in our country are failing public schools in our inner cities and lack of available jobs. Trump expressed a commitment to solve these problems at several points in his acceptance speech at the Republican convention. He pledged to reduce taxes and regulations, leading to many more jobs. And he said:","\"Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children are living in poverty, while 58% of African-American youth are not employed . . . . This administration has failed America\u2019s inner cities. It\u2019s failed them on education. It\u2019s failed and on jobs. It\u2019s failed them on crime . . . . Every action I take, I will ask myself: does this make life better for young Americans in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Ferguson who have as much of a right to live out their dreams as any other child in America? . . . . We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.\"","By contrast, Clinton will bow to the teachers\u2019 unions and oppose school choice at every turn, and she will continue to strangle businesses with high taxes and regulations, preventing job growth.","The military","Trump has promised to rapidly rebuild our depleted military forces, but Clinton would continue the liberal policy of eviscerating them through denying funding. This is dangerous in light of increasing threats from China, Russia, Iran, and ISIS.","Borders","Trump has repeatedly promised that he will finally secure our borders, an urgent need to protect the nation from ever more terrorists and drug smugglers. Clinton will not do this but will continue to allow in what she thinks will be thousands of future Democratic voters.","ISIS and terrorism","Trump has pledged to aggressively attack and utterly defeat ISIS. Clinton will continue the anemic Obama policy of periodic bombing runs and drone attacks, under which ISIS has continued to thrive.","China and Russia","Trump will not let China and Russia and Iran push us around anymore, as Obama has done, with Hillary Clinton\u2019s support when she was secretary of state. If Trump is anything, he is tough as nails, and he won\u2019t be bullied.","Israel","Trump has promised to vigorously defend and support Israel, while Clinton will most likely continue the Obama administration\u2019s criticism, snubbing, and marginalization of Israel.","Energy","Trump has said he will approve the Keystone oil pipeline and grant more oil drilling permits leading to lower energy costs and providing thousands of jobs. Lower energy costs help everybody, but the poor most of all. Clinton, by contrast, will make fracking nearly impossible and essentially abolish the coal industry, causing energy prices to skyrocket.","Executive orders and bathrooms","Trump has promised to rescind many of the most objectionable executive orders given by President Obama, so he will likely end the compulsory moral degradation forced on us by a liberal agenda, including orders forcing schools to allow boys in girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms, in defiance of the will of the vast majority of Americans. But Hillary Clinton would likely perpetuate and expand these policies.","Health care","Trump will work to repeal Obamacare, which is ruining the nation\u2019s health care system, and replace it with an affordable free market system in which companies have the ability to sell insurance across state lines, thus substantially lowering insurance prices especially in those states that currently allow only high-priced \"Cadillac\" insurance plans. But Clinton would continue to work relentlessly toward federal government control of our entire health care industry.","The unprotected","Trump will finally begin to recognize and protect what Wall Street Journal writer Peggy Noonan calls \"the unprotected\" in America -- people in lower income areas who cannot find good jobs, cannot find good schools for their children, do not feel protected from crime, and find their retirement savings are not enough because for years they have been earning no interest in the bank. Trump said in his acceptance speech, \"Every day I wake up determined to deliver for the people I have met all across the nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned . . . I have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves.\"","These American citizens recognize that Trump has built a business career on listening to experts, solving problems, and getting things done. They realize that Trump didn\u2019t earn $4 billion by being stupid, and their instinct says that he might be exactly the right person to solve some of the biggest problems in a nation that has for too long been headed in the wrong direction and stuck in political gridlock.","They may not have college degrees but their old-fashioned common sense tells them that America would be a much better place if we no longer had to be afraid to say \"Merry Christmas,\" or that boys are different from girls, or that Islamic terrorists are Islamic terrorists. They\u2019re sick and tired of being condescended to by the snobbish moralism of the liberal elites who dominate the power centers in our nation. That is why they cheer when Trump repeatedly violates the canons of politically correct speech. They have found in him someone who gives them hope, and they are supporting him by the thousands.","Does character matter?","\"But are you saying that character doesn\u2019t matter?\" someone might ask. I believe that character does matter, but I think Trump\u2019s character is far better than what is portrayed by much current political mud-slinging, and far better than his opponent\u2019s character.","In addition, if someone makes doubts about character the only factor to consider, that is a fallacy in ethical reasoning that I call \"reductionism\" \u2013 the mistake of reducing every argument to only one factor, when the situation requires that multiple factors be considered. In this election, an even larger factor is the future of the nation that would flow from a Clinton or a Trump presidency.","To my friends who tell me they won\u2019t vote for Trump because there is a chance he won\u2019t govern at all like he promises, I reply that all of American presidential history shows that that result is unlikely, and it is ethically fallacious reasoning to base a decision on assuming a result that is unlikely to happen.","Consider instead the most likely results. The most likely result of voting for Trump is that he will govern the way he promises to do, bringing much good to the nation.","But the most likely result of not voting for Trump is that you will be abandoning thousands of unborn babies who will be put to death under Hillary Clinton\u2019s Supreme Court, thousands of Christians who will be excluded from their lifelong occupations, thousands of the poor who will never again be able to find high-paying jobs in an economy crushed by government hostility toward business, thousands of inner-city children who will never be able to get a good education, thousands of the sick and elderly who will never get adequate medical treatment when the government is the nation\u2019s only healthcare provider, thousands of people who will be killed by an unchecked ISIS, and millions of Jews in Israel who will find themselves alone and surrounded by hostile enemies. And you will be contributing to a permanent loss of the American system of government due to a final victory of unaccountable judicial tyranny.","When I look at it this way, my conscience, and my considered moral judgment tell me that I must vote for Donald Trump as the candidate who is most likely to do the most good for the United States of America."],"targetTitle":"Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice","targetDescription":"Some of my Christian friends tell me they cant in good conscience vote for Donald Trump because, when faced with a choice between the lesser of two evils, the morally right thing is to choose neither one.

Even just browsing online is a risk in 2016.","SaferWeb had a primary objective to eliminate this by boosting security and ensure eavesdroppers cannot make sense of your encrypted communications.","Technical Lead John McBride, from SaferWeb explains; Our main objective for creating the app was pretty simple. We wanted to help users protect their Identity & Internet Connection to eliminate the risk of any online, banking or personal information being stolen, monitored or hacked\"","The company SaferWeb seemed to deliver on this objective perfectly. Using their technology will give a private tunnel between you and the internet that\u2019s invisible to hackers or any malware, letting you browse the Internet anonymously and securely. Literally anyone can use it and it only takes 5 minutes to set up.","So how can SaferWeb give this away? Apparently this promotional tactic is common among big companies with large marketing budgets. For instance, Burger King launched a similar campaign in 2013, giving away 20,000 free whoppers on Facebook.\"","One user we spoke to said, \"I came across SaferWeb and decided to give it a go, it\u2019s less than a cup of coffee anyways.

The results are quite substantial, going into the link between obesity and sleep deprivation.","Just by depriving oneself of sleep, one can experience an increase in appetite a lot like the one experienced after getting stoned. The results even suggest that it may be a reaction of the body that causes the hunger boost much like getting the munchies after a joint.","Conducting the study","The University of Chicago invited 14 men and women in their twenties to come and participate in two sessions at the clinical research centre there at the university. The researchers controlled the sleep patterns of the participants, meaning that sometimes they slept 7 hours and at other times their sleep was reduced down to only 4 hours and 11 minutes. The researchers also controlled how much food and what food was being served to the participants, serving them three meals a day at 9 am, 2 pm and 7 pm.","After the fourth night of each session, the participants were offered snacks from which to choose. They included the kind of snacks we like to indulge in when we are stoned, such as extremely sweet or salty food. They found that those that were sleep deprived were far less likely to resist the offer of snacks, and their urge to binge on them was highest in the afternoon right through to the early evening.","Sleep deprivation and obesity","It has long been believed that there is a link between sleep deprivation and obesity, and this study can confirm the very reason that they may be linked. Depriving the human body of sleep interfere\u2019s with its production of hormones that control things like appetite and satiety.","The scientists conducting this study looked into the kind of hormones that were present in the blood during the study. They looked specifically at the hormones ghrelin and leptin. Ghrelin is the hormone that deals with appetite whereas leptin is the hormone that tells the brain when the body is full of food.","The endocannabinoid system","Finally, the scientists decided that they would delve a little further into the body\u2019s craving for food and have a look at the endocannabinoid system, the same system that is excited and activated by using marijuana. Erin Hanlon, who lead the study, found that there was a certain endocannabinoid that was increased after sleep deprivation that could be the cause for the increase in appetite.","Endocannabinoid 2-AG is the chemical that increases the amount of pleasure you feel after you eat, and is an endocannabinoid that also increases after the use of marijuana. \"We know that marijuana activates the endocannabinoid system and causes people to overeat when they are not hungry, and they normally eat yummy sweet and fatty foods,\" Hanlon said. \"Sleep restriction may cause overeating by acting in the same manner.\"","So it seems that sleep deprivation has a very similar effect on the body in terms of appetite as using marijuana does. This means that a future of dealing with obesity through medicine that targets the endocannabinoid system is possible, although much more consideration would be required before moving into it.","Do you experience the munchies when you are sleep deprived?

This was not bedroom playacting between lovers; Bensley claimed to be a centuries-old vampire who needed blood to stay alive. The woman escaped and called police, and Lyle the would-be vampire was arrested for assault.","But is it safe to drink blood?","In very small amounts (say, a few teaspoons), and if the blood is free from pathogens (such as the many blood-borne diseases), blood might not harm you. Beyond that, watch out. [Circulatory System: Facts, Function & Diseases]","The strange fact is, blood, when drank, is toxic. When confined to places where blood is supposed to be \u2014 such as the heart, vessels, and so on \u2014 it is essential for life. But when ingested it's a very different story. Of course all toxins have doses, and just as a tiny bit of poison won't necessarily harm you, the more you eat or drink, the greater the danger. [7 Strange Ways that People Act Like Vampires]","Because blood is so rich in iron \u2014 and because the body has difficulty excreting excess iron \u2014 any animal that consumes blood regularly runs a risk of iron overdose. While iron is necessary for all animals (and indeed most life), in high doses it can be toxic. This condition, called haemochromatosis, can cause a wide variety of diseases and problems, including liver damage, buildup of fluid in the lungs, dehydration, low blood pressure, and nervous disorders.","Even so, blood-feeding in humans seems to be more common than one might expect. John Edgar Browning of Georgia Tech, who has researched the practice, suggests in a BBC article that thousands of people across the United States drink blood for various reasons. Some of these people say the oxygen- and iron-enriched substance gives them energy, and none of the drinkers interviewed by Browning have had any ill effects from their behavior, so perhaps they didn't overdo the blood meals: \"No vampire I\u2019ve interviewed has complained of any medical complications as a result of consuming blood,\" Browning said, according to BBC.","Unlike humans, the bodies of animals that digest blood have adapted specialized digestive mechanisms. According to Katherine Ramsland in her book \"The Science of Vampires\" (Penguin Putnam, 2002) the vampire bat, \"requires an enormous intake of iron, which helps make hemoglobin for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the body tissues. Yet the iron intake is generally higher than what the bat needs, so it has a special process for secreting the excess. When ingested, the blood goes through a tract that's adapted for extracting nutrients. Research on this system suggests that bats have a mucous membrane along the intestinal tract that acts as a barrier to prevent too much iron from getting into their bloodstreams.\"","You, however, are not a vampire bat. Because humans did not evolve such an iron-extracting mechanism, drinking blood can kill us.","If you're thinking of sampling human blood, make sure there's a doctor handy \u2014 for you, not your victim.","Editor's Note: This article was first published on Sept. 2, 2011.","Benjamin Radford is deputy editor of Skeptical Inquirer science magazine and author of six books including Scientific Paranormal Investigation: How to Solve Unexplained Mysteries.

We\u2019re good at something! Turns out, according to the second annual TD Bank Love and Money Study, millennials are better at handling their money and talking about it with their partners.","The study says that 74% of millennial couples talk about their money weekly, and that those who do report higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in their relationships.","This is very important, because as many relationship articles will tell you, money and talking about money is one of the highest stressors in relationships, which makes sense.

{"postId":"820502522343411712","postText":["\"I\u2019d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in.\""],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["The first hint of trouble came just a week after I had knee replacement surgery. I was rearranging the bedclothes over my new knee when I realized the down comforter felt like lead, and lifting it felt like doing a bench press.","That seemed curious, but I was so bent on getting the new knee to work properly that I ignored my sore arms as well as a stubborn stiffness in my neck and hips. Physical therapy was my focus, and the goal was to get back to my favorite pastime \u2014 rowing. It had kept me in shape for years, and I was missing early mornings on the Potomac.","Months later, I still hadn\u2019t picked up an oar. Instead, I\u2019d endured anemia, weight loss, fevers, stiffness and sometimes excruciating pain in my hips and legs. I felt as if I\u2019d been hit by the flu, or maybe a truck. Getting out of bed was painful, and getting into a boat again seemed an impossible task.","The culprit: polymyalgia rheumatica, or PMR, an autoimmune disease that spreads painful inflammation through most of the body\u2019s joints.","Never heard of it? Neither had I. Yet it strikes many older Americans, usually in their 70s and 80s, more women than men. The afflicted are more often of Northern European extraction, indicating to researchers that genetics may be at work.","Fortunately, PMR responds quickly to the steroid drug prednisone. The important thing is to recognize, not ignore, the symptoms and seek help. I felt better within a day of finally seeing my doctor, being diagnosed and taking my first dose of prednisone. In most cases, the condition can be cured, although slowly over months, sometimes years. And in some situations it can be complicated by a more serious disease.","Why and how PMR strikes is mysterious, although researchers are looking at viruses or stress as triggers for the disease. But undeniably, it is associated with aging, and particularly the aging immune system.","With the first wave of baby boomers heading into their 70s this year, America\u2019s elderly population will swell, and doctors think there will almost certainly be more cases of PMR.","Basically, polymyalgia rheumatica tricks the immune system into attacking its own body \u2014 sending antibodies and immune cells into the hundreds of fluid-filled sacs called bursae that lie throughout our joints and surrounding soft tissue. In the healthy body, those sacs \u2014 some no wider than a dime, others the size of a silver dollar \u2014 keep our joints moving smoothly. But when inflamed by PMR, they cause pain and stiffness. PMR also impedes the bone marrow\u2019s ability to make red blood cells, causing anemia.","Such an inflammatory response is like a complex cascade, according to Marcy O\u2019Koon Moss, director of consumer health for the Arthritis Foundation, which counts PMR among more than 100 diseases it focuses on.","\"It\u2019s not one thing that happens. The cells involved signal each other and communicate,\" she said.","Many people stricken with PMR confuse their symptoms with aging and just soldier on. But as the disease progresses and becomes more debilitating, most figure that something beyond old age is at work.","Phil Ringo, 74, of Haverford, Pa., couldn\u2019t imagine what was wrong four years ago when he began feeling sore and ill.","\"I thought I\u2019d gone from a pretty vigorous 70-year-old to an old, old man,\" he said. \"Grandchildren were saying, \u2018What\u2019s wrong with Papa?\u2019 \"","Unable to get out of a chair or into a cab without a struggle, he got no answers from his doctors. And when he tried for an appointment with one of the nation\u2019s top diagnostic clinics, \"they basically said, \u2018You\u2019re an old guy.\u2019 \" Ringo said. \" \u2018 Just get used to it.\u2019 \" He was finally diagnosed and treated after a friend with the disease convinced him to see a rheumatologist.","Actually PMR is famously tricky to diagnose.","\"A definitive test does not exist for PMR,\" said rheumatologist Rebecca Manno, a Johns Hopkins School of Medicine faculty member and researcher. \"And there are other conditions that mimic PMR,\" such as rheumatoid arthritis, various infections and even some forms of cancer.","So the diagnostic process can be torturous. Leslie Kermath, 70, of Whitefish, Mont., spent almost a month undergoing tests before her doctor felt confident that PMR was causing her pain, stiffness and fever.","Along the way, she got antibiotics for an existing urinary tract infection, was sent to the hospital for a chest X-ray and a CAT scan after a test flagged a possible blood clot. Later she had another CAT scan of her abdomen and pelvis, because her hips were terribly painful. A Lyme disease test came back negative.","Eventually, her blood tests, which showed increasing levels of inflammation, plus her symptoms and age, nailed the diagnosis for Kermath\u2019s doctor, who started her on prednisone.","\"How many women of Caucasian origin, who are older, think they\u2019re just aging and can\u2019t do everything they used to \u2014 when they actually have this disease?\" said Kermath, who is an avid hiker.","Most doctors suspecting PMR order several blood tests, almost always two that look for inflammation: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, known as the ESR test, and another for CRP, or C-reactive protein. Doctors also check for antibodies associated with rheumatoid arthritis, to rule out that disease.","When I finally dragged myself to my internist three months after my symptoms showed up, she immediately suspected PMR. Given my age \u2014 73 \u2014 my symptoms and lab results showing considerable inflammation and anemia, she started me on prednisone and sent me to a rheumatologist. After eight weeks of prednisone, my inflammation numbers had fallen to near normal and my anemia was under control.","My rheumatologist has reduced my steroid dose, but only very gradually because rebounds do happen. The hope is that I can be steroid-free \u2014 a sign of a cure \u2014 sometime in 2017.","\"Treating PMR is one of the more gratifying parts of my practice,\" said my doctor, Joseph P. Laukaitis. \"In my experience, about 95 percent of patients fully recover.\"","For a PMR patient, prednisone feels like a miracle drug because it so quickly attacks inflammation and banishes the pain and stiffness. But in fact, prednisone is \"wonderful, wicked\" in Manno\u2019s words. The side effects that some people experience are considerable: a thinning of the bones (already a problem for many older women), high blood pressure, weight gain, high blood sugar, insomnia and a distinctive addition of facial fat known as \"moon face.\"","Most patients who take prednisone for PMR will also be prescribed a drug to slow bone loss, and that medication, too, has side effects.","Although diagnosing PMR can be difficult, doing so is crucial because a much more serious disease, giant cell arteritis, strikes about 10 to 20 percent of people with PMR. Giant cell arteritis causes inflammation and damage to blood vessels in the head and elsewhere. Untreated, it can cause blindness, stroke, even death. PMR patients can expect their doctors to look for symptoms of GCA: severe headaches, tender scalp, jaw pain and blurred vision.","Any one of those can indicate that the arteries of the head are inflamed. The diagnosis often requires a biopsy of one of the arteries in the scalp to confirm inflammation. Again, prednisone is the treatment.","Much of today\u2019s research into PMR and GCA looks for alternatives to prednisone.","Biologics \u2014 drugs made from living organisms \u2014 hold promise because some can \"inhibit an inflammatory response as it picks up steam,\" the Arthritis Foundation\u2019s O\u2019Koon Moss said. \"It\u2019s like interrupting a chain reaction.\"","\"There are also promising clinical trials of drugs that treat rheumatoid arthritis and have FDA approval for that. And they may be effective for PMR,\" Manno said.","Until other drugs become available, prednisone will remain the preferred treatment despite all its of downsides.","As I face months of treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica, taking smaller and smaller doses of prednisone each month, I hope to avoid remission and eventually regain my strength. Exercise is key, as it so often is when ill health strikes, so you\u2019ll find me on the stationary bike or walking or, if not rowing, at least beginning to build up stamina on the indoor rowing machine.","The rowing season of 2016 may have eluded me, but the 2017 season is only months away."],"targetTitle":"I\u2019d never heard of this condition until the terrible joint pain set in","targetDescription":"Don\u2019t delay going to the doctor, because treatment can make you feel better fast.","targetKeywords":"joint pain, pmr, polymyalgia rheumatica, prednisone, aging joints, pain management, cortisone shot, immune system","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":269}

Ben Zobrist hit a go-ahead double, and Miguel Montero followed up with an R.B.I. single to give the Cubs the insurance run they needed.","It is their third title in the World Series, a competition that was introduced in 1903, but this may be the sweetest and hardest-earned championship in the history of American sports. Making it even more sweet was that the Cubs trailed in the series by three games to one.","Upon the final out the players jumped and celebrated on the diamond while thousands of visiting Cubs fans screamed joyfully in the stands. Back in Chicago, where fans in the North Side of Chicago have waited generations for this day, revelers poured into the streets for party that will probably last days.","In Cleveland, a city with its own hard-luck sports history, the wait continues. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948, and they now own the longest drought in baseball without a title. At least the Cleveland Cavaliers, many of whom were in attendance Wednesday at Progressive Field, broke Cleveland\u2019s 52-year span without a major professional sports title by winning the N.B.A. championship in June.","For the Cubs, whose long history is riddled with the mythology of billy goat curses, black cats and a fan who was vilified for interfering with a foul ball, theirs is now a history of winning, and their identity changes forever.","Theo Epstein knows all about that. He is the Cubs\u2019 top baseball decision-maker, the man who put together a team and an ethos capable of dashing history\u2019s long reach.","Prior to joining the Cubs, Epstein was the general manager of the Boston Red Sox in 2004, when that once-accursed franchise won its first World Series in 86 years. Red Sox and Cubs fans were the longest suffering at the time, and Epstein has given closure to both.","Here\u2019s an inning-by-inning breakdown of how the Cubs won Game 7:","Top of 1st: Fowler Crushes One","Corey Kluber is trying to become the first pitcher to win three starts in a single World Series since 1968, but he got off to a terrible start when Dexter Fowler launched the fourth pitch of the game over the center field wall, giving the Cubs a 1-0 lead and quieting the Indians fans at Cleveland\u2019s Progressive Field. It was the first leadoff home run ever in Game 7 of a World Series.","After Fowler\u2019s blast, Kyle Schwarber hit a slow grounder to the right side of the infield. The Indians had the shift on, and Francisco Lindor, the shortstop, was able to field the ball, but Schwarber, running on a reconstructed knee, was able to beat the throw for an infield single.","Kris Bryant flied out to right for the first out of the game, and Anthony Rizzo followed him by flying out to center. Schwarber, who has three career stolen bases, surprised the Indians (and just about anyone watching) by stealing second with Ben Zobrist at the plate, but Kluber was able to get Zobrist to pop out to end the inning.","Kluber escaped having allowed just one run and kept his pitch count to 19, but it was hardly the start he was looking for.","David Waldstein: When Fowler hit that home run, I almost thought for a moment that Rajai Davis caught the ball on his jump because it seemed like the entire stadium erupted. But it was Cubs fans celebrating the home run. I have never seen this many visiting fans invade a baseball stadium for such a big game. Yes, you will see a lot of Yankees fans in Tampa in May, but this is Game 7 of the World Series. If it is not 50-50 between Cubs and Indians fans, then it is 40-60. In the section of the bleachers closest to center field, it appeared to be 80 percent Cubs fans.","Bottom of 1st: Indians Can\u2019t Match Cubs\u2019 Start","The Indians were not able to match the Cubs\u2019 strong start to the game.","Leadoff man Carlos Santana crushed a liner to right on Kyle Hendricks\u2019s first pitch, but it was right at Jason Heyward, who easily caught the ball for the first out. Jason Kipnis followed him and flailed meekly at a low changeup for strike three. Francisco Lindor then hit a grounder to second that appeared to be an easy out, but Javier Baez slipped when trying to throw from his knees, which allowed Lindor to reach safely. Hendricks was able to work around the error by inducing a broken-bat grounder to shortstop from Mike Napoli to end the inning.","Victor Mather: Hendricks last pitched in Game 3, when he threw 4 1\/3 somewhat shaky innings, giving up six hits and two walks. But crucially, like the first inning tonight, he gave up no runs.","David Waldstein: Terry Francona was on a pregame humor jag, making jokes about how he had a dream after Game 6 that someone was breaking his ribs. He woke up to discover he had been sleeping on the TV remote and it was stuck in his ribcage. He also admitted he was dipping pretzels in peanut butter in bed and when he woke up there was peanut butter on his glasses. \"My bedroom looked like a national disaster last night,\" he said. Too much info?","Top of 2nd: Kluber Settles In","Kluber got through the inning in an efficient seven pitches. Addison Russell was the offensive star of Game 6 with a two-run double and a grand slam, but Corey Kluber was able to retire him in his first at-bat tonight on a towering popup to shortstop. Willson Contreras then hit a pitch into right-field foul territory that Lonnie Chisenhall tracked down with little effort. Jason Heyward shattered his bat popping out to shortstop.","David Waldstein: Kluber settles down to retire the last six batters, all on fly balls. Kluber is 12-1 in his last 14 starts at Progressive Field with a 1.87 earned run average, including postseason games. But this is the only time he has started three times in nine days. Now it\u2019s up the the Indians hitters to get him back even.","Bottom of 2nd: Hendricks Helps Himself","The Indians had runners reach base twice in the half-inning but got nothing to show for it.","Jose Ramirez led off with a grounder that caromed off of Kyle Hendricks before rolling toward shortstop. With the ball coming at him fairly slowly, Addison Russell tried to barehand it but came up without the ball as Ramirez reached first. The play was ruled a single rather than an error, as Russell likely did not have a play. Ramirez, however, underestimated Hendricks\u2019 ability to hold on runners and got picked off of first.","Lonnie Chisenhall singled, but Rajai Davis grounded into a 5-4-3 double play that was truly impressive considering Davis\u2019s speed.","David Waldstein: Great play by the icy-veined Kyle Hendricks to pick off Jose Ramirez off first. But everyone knows Hendricks has a terrific pickoff move, so it is kind of unforgivable to get caught. That really messed up the inning because Chisenhall\u2019s single would have put two runners on base with nobody out.","The Indians were very sloppy in Game 6 and cannot afford to do that again, especially with the Cubs\u2019 batters getting warmed up in this weather.","Top of 3rd: Schwarber Runs Cubs Out of Inning","Javier Baez put a big swing on a 1-1 curveball but just missed as he flied out to left for the first out of the inning. Dexter Fowler, he of the leadoff home run, then jumped on the first pitch he saw from Corey Kluber in his second at-bat, but lined out to right. With two outs, Kyle Schwarber swung into the shift and punched the ball through the crowded right side of the infield. But Schwarber got greedy and tried to stretch the hit into a double and was thrown out easily at second base by Lonnie Chisenhall to end the inning.","Victor Mather: Maybe you aren\u2019t a baseball fan. Well, Akron and Toledo are involved in some exciting college football MACtion on ESPN2. As you might expect, with an Indians World Series on the line, the crowd is sparse in Akron.","David Waldstein: Lonnie Chisenhall has had an adventurous World Series, but he has a great arm and Schwarber never should have challenged it, especially with a surgically repaired knee. The shenanigans in the outfield in Game 6 were mostly miscommunication and the fault of the center fielder, Tyler Naquin, and that is why he is on the bench.","Bottom of 3rd: Indians Get Aggressive","The Indians tied the game thanks to a leadoff double, a well-placed bunt, and a run-scoring single. It looked like it could get far worse for the Cubs, but Kyle Hendricks once again worked his way around a few baserunners.","Coco Crisp got things started by showing some serious aggressiveness, lacing a ball into the left field corner and legging out a leadoff double. Hoping to take advantage of the baserunner by playing some small ball, the Indians had Roberto Perez bunt Crisp over to third. Carlos Santana then crushed a 1-0 curveball to right for a single, bringing Crisp home and tying the game.","With one run in, Jason Kipnis hit what looked like a double-play ball to shortstop. Addison Russell flipped to Javier Baez who dropped the ball, and all runners were ruled safe after a review of the play.","The defensive miscue set Cleveland up with runners on first and second with one out. But Francisco Lindor flied out to left and Mike Napoli lined out to third to end the threat.","Victor Mather: It\u2019s been a tough Series for Napoli, who was 4-for-19 without an extra-base hit coming into this game, is 0 for 2 tonight and just missed his chance with men on first and second and two outs. It was a great advertisement for replay when the terrible out call on Santana at second was overturned. Baez never had it.","David Waldstein: The Indians are squaring up on Hendricks, so Cubs Manager Joe Maddon instructed Jon Lester to start warming up.","It was so important for the Indians to get back even, which is why they played for the one run. Some may have wanted the Indians to play for the big inning since they seemed to be on Hendricks, but Francona elected to draw even. Roberto Perez did a terrific job of executing the bunt with Rizzo only about 20 feet away from him. The Cubs, particularly Baez, are looking shaky.","Top of 4th: Cubs Back on Top","A shallow pop-fly to center and some aggressive baserunning by Kris Bryant put the Cubs back in the lead. Willson Contreras tacked on an R.B.I. double and with a 3-1 lead, Chicago had some breathing room for the first time this game.","Bryant led off the inning by working a full-count against Corey Kluber, and on the eighth pitch of the at-bat he singled on a hard grounder to left. Anthony Rizzo was hit in the right shoulder by a pitch, bringing up Ben Zobrist with two runners on and no outs. He hit a grounder to first that Mike Napoli fielded and threw to Francisco Lindor who was covering second. Rizzo slid in under Lindor\u2019s feet, but was ruled out even though Lindor\u2019s foot may not have been on the bag.","That brought up Addison Russell with runners at the corners and he hit a shallow pop-up to center. Bryant, knowing that Rajai Davis does not have a strong throwing arm, broke for home as Davis caught the ball and he slid in just ahead of the tag from Roberto Perez.","Kluber looked like he had Contreras on the ropes with two outs, but the young catcher launched a 2-2 curveball into deep center that got over Davis\u2019s head. Zobrist scored and Contreras got into second base easily. Kluber ended the bleeding by retiring Jason Heyward on a pop-out to shortstop.","David Waldstein: Now the Indians are making the miscues. The Cubs scored twice, but it could have been and maybe should have been zero. The Believelanders are feeling like Bereavelanders.","Victor Mather: Wilson Contreras, 1-for-17 coming into tonight, has probably been the Cubs\u2019 worst Series performer. But he comes through to give the Cubs the 3-1 lead. His rookie season was a key part of the Cubs\u2019 fine year; now he adds a big World Series R.B.I.","Bottom of 4th: Hendricks Works Well With a Lead","Kyle Hendricks undoubtedly has an incredibly short leash from Joe Maddon, but he started things off well in the half-inning by retiring Jose Ramirez on a soft grounder to first base. He retired Lonnie Chisenhall on a soft fly to left for the second out, and got Rajai Davis to fly to right to end the inning. Hendricks has thrown just 50 pitches, but it would be surprising if he stayed in the game beyond the fifth inning.","David Waldstein: That was a great inning by Hendricks. One of the most important things in pitching is the shutdown inning after your team scores. Hendricks had his cleanest frame of the game and that was vital in terms of solidifying the lead and demoralizing the Indians. The tension and the excitement that was felt in this stadium just an inning ago has changed perceptibly. Now it feels just a tiny bit more like a sense of inevitability. The Cubs seem to be rolling ever since Game 5. Still a ways to go, though. The meat of the Indians\u2019 order comes up at least two more times.","Top of 5th: Baez Ends Kluber\u2019s Night","The Cubs extended their lead to four the hard way, by getting one apiece off of Corey Kluber and Andrew Miller.","Javier Baez took a hard cut at Kluber\u2019s first pitch of the inning and crushed a home run, ending the ace\u2019s night. Terry Francona immediately headed to the mound to replace him with Miller and start what could be a long night for the Indians\u2019 bullpen.","Dexter Fowler was the first batter to face Miller and was not intimidated by the reliever, stroking a 1-2 slider into left for a single. But Kyle Schwarber gave Miller some help by grounding into a 6-4-3 double-play.","Kris Bryant came up with two outs and worked a full-count off of Miller. He somehow ended up drawing a walk on the ninth pitch of the at-bat, after seeing Miller\u2019s \"unhittable\" slider on six consecutive pitches, and then was running on the pitch when Anthony Rizzo sliced a single to right. Bryant, running hard the entire way, was able to score and Rizzo reached second after the throw.","It looked like Chicago could do even more damage when Ben Zobrist hit a ball to deep center field, but Rajai Davis caught it on the warning track to end the inning. Miller, who the Indians would like to soak up at least a few innings, has already thrown 20 pitches.","David Waldstein: The Cubs are really swinging well now in the warm weather, much like they did in the regular season when they scored 808 runs, the most by a National League team at sea level (Red Sox had 878 runs, the Rockies 845). Perhaps it was only a matter of time, perhaps it was fatigue among the Indians\u2019 pitchers, perhaps it was the addition of Schwarber lengthening the lineup. Even Baez, who was 4 for 26 with 4 singles (and 2 errors in Game 7) hit a home run off the previously impenetrable Kluber. They are even hitting Andrew Miller hard.","Victor Mather: If this were the last time the Cubs won the World Series, the game would be over. The decisive Game 5 of that Series, in 1908, lasted 1 hour, 25 minutes. No game in the series lasted more than 2:10.","Bottom of 5th: Lester and Ross Open Door for Indians","The move to bring in Jon Lester as a reliever had major implications for the Cubs, mostly because of the corresponding move to put in his personal catcher, David Ross. Because of two miscues by Ross, the Indians scored two runs, cutting Chicago\u2019s lead in half.","Kyle Hendricks was allowed to come out to start the inning even though Jon Lester was ready in Chicago\u2019s bullpen. He got a soft grounder to second from Coco Crisp for the first out, and struck out Roberto Perez for out two. But Hendricks walked Carlos Santana and his day was done, with Lester being summoned to face Jason Kipnis.","Kipnis hit a soft grounder that was fielded by Ross, but the veteran who had just entered the game, threw the ball well out of Anthony Rizzo\u2019s reach, which resulted in Francisco Lindor coming up with runners on second and third with two outs. Lester threw a ball in the dirt that caromed off of Ross\u2019s mask and as the catcher tried to go after it, he stumbled, taking so long to recover the ball that both runners scored.","Lester was able to strike out Lindor to end the inning, but the game certainly got more interesting.","Because Hendricks did not pitch five innings, he is not in line for the victory should the Cubs hold on.","David Waldstein: Lester (and to a lesser degree, Ross) coming into the game was supposed to be the Cubs\u2019 Madison Bumgarner moment, but it looked more like an old-fashioned Cubs moment. Terrific, aggressive base running by Jason Kipnis to score from second base on a wild pitch. He never hesitated and made a beautiful slide under the tag, then got up and punched the air. Terrible inning by Ross, who made the error to allow Kipnis to get all the way to second, and then was staggered by the ball when the wild pitch hit him in the mask. It feels like a game again.","Top of 6th: Ross Makes Up for Mistakes","David Ross helped erase some of the damage his defense had done in the previous inning by launching a one-out home run to center field that pushed Chicago\u2019s lead back to 6-3. Jason Heyward was the second out of the inning when he grounded out to first, and Javier Baez struck out to end the inning.","Andrew Miller, who looked unhittable earlier in the playoffs, has now allowed two earned runs and gotten just four outs.","David Waldstein: I promise, were not making all this up. David Ross, who is playing in his last professional baseball game at age 39, who has played on 21 different professional teams at all levels, who is the elder statesman of the Cubs, just hit his first World Series home run. It came after a wild inning behind the plate where he made one error, then got punched in the mask by a bouncing wild pitch that allowed two runs to score. Is it meant to be?","Bottom of 6th: Indians Come Up Short","Mike Napoli continued his struggles by striking out to lead off the half-inning. That brought up Jose Ramirez, and the third baseman grounded out to shortstop, nearly beating Addison Russell\u2019s throw to first base that Anthony Rizzo made a great stretch on. Brandon Guyer came in as a pinch-hitter for Lonnie Chisenhall and he hit a two-out single to left, but Rajai Davis grounded out to strand him at first.","Victor Mather: Oct. 14, 1908. Bennett Park, Detroit. Orval Overall outdueled Wild Bill Donovan, and the Cubs won the World Series. They are nine outs away from doing it again.","Top of 7th: Cubs Chase Miller, but Fail to Score","Dexter Fowler improved to 3 for 4 by singling to start the inning. That brought Kyle Schwarber to the plate in a tough lefty-on-lefty matchup against Andrew Miller and the ace reliever won the battle, getting Schwarber to fly out to left.","But with that that, Miller\u2019s day was over, with Terry Francona replacing him with the team\u2019s closer, Cody Allen. Allen was able to strand the runner he inherited from Miller by striking out Kris Bryant, as Fowler was caught stealing after the pitch for a double play.","While Miller is not on the hook for a loss, the game was well below his standards. He threw 43 pitches in two and one-third innings, allowing four hits and two earned runs.","Bottom of 7th: Lester Gets Job Done","Coco Crisp flied out to left to start the inning and then Jon Lester ran the count full against Roberto Perez before walking the catcher on the seventh pitch of the at-bat. Tyler Naquin came in as a pinch-runner for Perez before Carlos Santana hit a come-backer to Lester. The yips that have been a topic of conversation throughout the playoffs were in play as Lester barely looked at second before throwing underhand to first to get one out on a play that would have gotten two with almost any other pitcher on the mound. Lester did not end up paying for it as he struck out Jason Kipnis to end the inning.","Top of 8th: Allen Shuts Down Cubs","A dropped strike three forced a throw to first base, but Anthony Rizzo was easily retired to start the inning. Then Ben Zobrist looked completely overwhelmed by Cody Allen\u2019s stuff before eventually grounding out to first. Addison Russell watched strikes one and two sail right past him before popping out to first base to end the inning. Allen has need just 17 pitches to record five outs.","Bottom of 8th: Tie Game!","A day after he was controversially brought into a blowout rather than being preserved for a Game 7 appearance, Aroldis Chapman proved to be human by giving up Chicago\u2019s three-run lead in just two batters.","Jon Lester had gotten the first two outs of the inning but was pulled from the game after Jose Ramirez hit a ball up the middle that Addison Russell couldn\u2019t quite handle.","Brought in for a four-out save, Chapman fired seven consecutive fastballs to Brandon Guyer, topping out at 100.3 miles per hour, but it was the last one that cost him as Guyer drove the ball to left\u2013center for a double, bringing in a run. Chapman then imploded, allowing a two-run home run to Rajai Davis that tied the game and blew the save attempt. Coco Crisp piled on with a single but Yan Gomes, who had entered the game in the eighth inning, struck out to end the inning.","Chapman ended up throwing 21 pitches and looked like he was completely out of gas despite the radar gun indicating he still had his velocity.","Top of 9th: Cubs\u2019 Squeeze Doesn\u2019t Work","With new life breathed into the Cleveland Indians, and rain starting to fall, Cody Allen walked the leadoff batter, David Ross, on five pitches. The Cubs looked to capitalize by bringing in Chris Coghlan as a pinch-runner for Ross, but he was erased on a force-out when Jason Heyward grounded to second base. Heyward then got something started by stealing his third base of the series, and advanced to third on a bad throw from Yan Gomes.","Michael Martinez was brought in as a defensive replacement in right field to help prevent a sacrifice fly from scoring a run, but Shaw took care of Javier Baez by striking him out on an awkward two-strike bunt attempt. That brought up Dexter Fowler, who had been one of the Cubs\u2019 better hitters all game, and he laced a ball up the middle that looked like it would get through before Francisco Lindor chased it down behind second base and threw Fowler out at first.","The Indians now have a chance to win the game and the series at home in the bottom of the ninth.","Bottom of 9th: Chapman Shuts Down Indians in 9th","This game is headed to extra innings.","Aroldis Chapman was back out to start the bottom of the ninth despite having looked completely worn out in the eighth. He got Carlos Santana to fly out before ending up in a long battle with Jason Kipnis. He fired Kipnis a steady diet of sliders rather than his signature heater and ended up in a full-count before slamming the door with a 97.4-mph fastball. Francisco Lindor flied out to right, ending the inning.","Victor Mather: Extra-innings Game 7\u2019s: 1924 Senators-Giants, 1991 Twins-Braves, 1997 Marlins- Indians. And tonight.","Top of 10th: Rain Delay, Then Cubs Pounce","The Cubs are back in the lead thanks to Ben Zobrist, Miguel Montero, and a couple questional intentional walks.","After a brief rain delay, the game resumed with Kyle Schwarber facing off against Bryan Shaw. The Cubs\u2019 designated hitter once again attacked the shift, hitting a grounder through the right side of the infield for his third hit of the game.","Albert Almora came in as a pinch-runner for Schwarber and the move paid off when Kris Bryant hit a deep flyout to center and Almora showed off some tremendous baserunning ability by tagging up and advancing to second.","With first base empty, Shaw intentionally walked Anthony Rizzo to get to Zobrist. The versatile veteran who won a World Series with Kansas City last year made him pay for it by driving in Almora with a double down the third-base line that energized the Cubs.","Shaw then issued another intentional walk, this one to Addison Russell, and with the bases loaded, Miguel Montero laced a single into left that drove in Chicago\u2019s eighth run of the game.","Cleveland brought in Trevor Bauer with the bases loaded and one out, and the losing pitcher in Games 2 and 5 took care of business, striking out Jason Heyward and getting Javier Baez to fly out to center field to limit the damage.The Indians now have three outs to get back into the game.","Bottom of 10th: Indians Get a Run, but Needed Two","With one out left in the game, the Indians closed their deficit to one run but that was as close as they would get as the Cubs ended a World Series drought that had been going since 1908.","The ending was complicated because Aroldis Chapman was out of the game after throwing 35 pitches in one and one-third innings. With their closer gone, the Cubs called on Carl Edwards Jr., a 25-year-old right-hander with 41 career regular season appearances and two career saves, to close things out. The 2011 48th-round draft pick started things off by striking out Mike Napoli swinging on a 95-mph fastball. He got Jose Ramirez to ground out to shortstop for the second out. That brought up Brandon Guyer, and Edwards walked him on five pitches.","With Rajai Davis, who had tied the game in the eighth inning with a two-run homer, due up, Cubs pitching coach Chris Bosio visited the mound. Chicago allowed Guyer to advance to second base without a throw and Davis delivered again with a single that drove Guyer in and closed the gap to one run.","Joe Maddon was not taking any chances and he pulled the plug on his young pitcher, pulling him for Michael Montgomery with Michael Martinez due up. The left-hander took care of business, retiring Martinez on a soft groundball and earning himself a save."],"targetTitle":"World Series: Here\u2019s How the Chicago Cubs Won Game 7","targetDescription":"It\u2019s true.

Park somewhere where you\u2019ll stay parked to catch Poke\u0301mon.","Poke\u0301mon Go requires your full attention. Driving also requires your full attention. Yes, there\u2019s the augmented reality mode, and you can leave that AR feature on to put Poke\u0301mon on a backdrop of whatever\u2019s in front of you. Problem is, you\u2019re then focusing on catching the Poke\u0301mon instead of the background of reality.","The little suckers move around in AR mode, too! It\u2019s one thing to walk around your apartment trying to catch a particularly jump-happy Poke\u0301mon. It\u2019s much worse to do so while also trying to drive. You can\u2019t easily spin around in the driver\u2019s seat if a Poke\u0301mon darts sideways, and it takes an absurd amount of your attention to follow them around anyway.","So, keep it in park if you\u2019re going to do anything in the game. You can enjoy the comfortable seats, luxurious cupholders and life-sustaining air conditioning of your car\u2019s interior, but don\u2019t play the game itself unless your car is safely parked, and out of the way of other traffic.","Simply put: \"P\" means \"play.\" Or, if you have a manual transmission, don\u2019t even think about playing until you\u2019ve yanked the parking brake.","Parked to figure out my next move.","Rule No. 2: Scope Out Your Next Poke\u0301stop Before Going There","The great thing about the Poke\u0301mon Go interface is that it gives you a map. You can tap on further away gyms and Poke\u0301stops to see where they are before they\u2019re in range, and thus, you can figure out where you\u2019d like to go next without the app distracting you from the task of driving.","Find a few points of interest, write them down, or put them in your car\u2019s navigation unit. Then drive there! Driving is great. When you park, do so in a safe and legal location. Be sure to follow all applicable traffic and parking laws as you normally would.","Rule No. 3: Leave Your Phone On, But On Silent And Hidden","One big downside to the game is that it has to be on and running to work, or to log those brief moments where you\u2019re traveling at low speeds (more on this later). This will drain your battery life fast, according to anyone who\u2019s ever played the game for more than 30 minutes.","Fortunately, most cars now come with power outlets, so your car is bizarrely well-suited for hunting Poke\u0301mon. Once you have your next Poke\u0301stop determined, plug your phone in, throw it on silent, and forget about it until your next stop. Then you\u2019ll pull up with a fully recharged phone with more than enough battery life to stuff your next gym full of Magikarp.","http:\/\/kotaku.com\/pokemon-go-pla...","How to leave your phone hidden while charging, as illustrated in a Porsche 918 Spyder.","If you\u2019re the kind of person who is tempted by phone sounds, hide it in a cubbyhole. Out of sight, out of mind. If you know you\u2019ll still somehow hear it vibrate, turn off that function as well. If you really have no self-control, stick your phone in the trunk.","I will say that my fear of becoming That Guy who mowed down an entire median full of ornamental shrubberies while playing Poke\u0301mon Go has made me a less distracted driver. With the game on, gone is my temptation to glance down at text messages at stop lights. I simply don\u2019t want to interrupt the game or get caught using it behind the wheel.","One of many landmarks you\u2019ll find as Poke\u0301stops in the game.","Rule No. 4: Get Out And Walk Around Anyway","I\u2019m always looking for shortcuts. So, naturally, the idea of tossing my phone in the trunk to run a few errands\u2014or laps on a race track\u2014to hatch an egg sounded like a solid plan.","Nope. The app was one step ahead of that idea. After my roughly 48-kilometer drive to test this idea barely netted any km towards egg hatching, I wondered what was up.","Turns out, there\u2019s a speed limit on what the game will log in terms of distance traveled. While I couldn\u2019t find the limit published on any official channels, one unofficial source on Quora claimed the app is limited to 20 kph\u2014which sounds about right.","Because you have to drive safely, we don\u2019t recommend puttering around at speeds slower than 20 kph on public roads. That\u2019s only about 12 mph for those of us not fully dedicated to the metric system. 12! You would blow the fuse in your horn if you got stuck behind some jamoke doing 12 mph on a public road.","It\u2019s still worth having the app on and hidden in your car as it will still log that brief bit of travel under 12 mph, but don\u2019t expect it to hatch eggs much faster. There are better ways to cheat this, after all, some of which even involve the use of remote-control cars.","If you\u2019re playing around cars, make sure they\u2019re going to stay parked for a while. Inside Petrol Lounge, Austin.","Rather, do what the game wants you to do: get out and explore. See your city\u2019s landmarks. If you have an egg to hatch, drive to a park that has a few stops in it.","Pick Poke\u0301stops that coincide with other errands you have to do. My usual coffee shop, for example, is next door to a gym. That\u2019s convenient! I\u2019m out of my car anyway and it\u2019s a place I don\u2019t mind hanging out for a little while.","Once you\u2019re at a stop and have caught all the new Poke\u0301mon you can, you can start the process all over again: pick a new Poke\u0301stop or gym to drive to based on the options available, toss your silent phone on a charger out of reach, and have at it."],"targetTitle":"How To Play Pok\u00e9mon Go In Your Car Without Mowing Down Trees Or People","targetDescription":"Let\u2019s get this out of the way: Pok\u00e9mon Go is meant for walking. But where I live, it\u2019s also upwards of 100 degrees outside right now. And besides, walking? This is America; that\u2019s for suckers. But for those tempted to play the game while driving, it\u2019s proven extremely dangerous.

That's because Scarlett Johansson -- who co-stars with Joaquin Phoenix in the film, but doesn't appear onscreen -- gives such a remarkable performance that she could wind up with an historic Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.","Jonze's film, a near-future tale about a man (Phoenix) who falls in love with his computer operating system (voiced by Johansson), received high praise from many critics following its debut, with most singling out Johansson's voice work as exceptional.","\"It's Johansson who pulls off the trickiest feat: She creates a complex, full-bodied character without any body at all. Detached from her lethally curvaceous figure, the actress' breathy contralto is no less seductive, but it also alights with tenderness and wonder as Samantha, both here on Earth and up there in the Cloud, voraciously devours literature, philosophy and human experience,\" wrote Variety critic Scott Foundas.","\"Johansson's work in the film is lovely, and the best thing about the way she plays the part is that there's nothing calculated or 'sexy' about the way she approaches it. Removed from the undeniable sweater-girl appeal she packs when she's onscreen, forced to rely only on her voice, Johansson comes across as a warm, curious, vibrant personality. It's incredibly appealing,\" echoed HitFix critic Drew McWeeny. (HuffPost Entertainment was in the tank for Johansson as well.)","With regard to Johansson's Oscar bona fides, the issue becomes slightly tricky. As Deadline.com's Pete Hammond pointed out, non-traditional \"flesh-and-blood\" acting roles -- like Andy Serkis, who did revolutionary motion-capture work as Gollum in the \"Lord of the Rings\" films -- are normally ignored by Academy Awards voters. Johansson's performance appears somewhat different, however, as she's not helped by any technical tricks or animation.","For what it's worth, Warner Bros. and \"Her\" producer Megan Ellison are planning a full-court press for Johansson's awards campaign. Ellison tweeted this in response to Hammond's post on Sunday:","@NikkiFinke @Deadline","Scarlett is eligible, deserves the recognition, and we are going to campaign for her \u2014 Megan Ellison (@meganeellison) October 13, 2013","\"Her\" is out in theaters on Dec. 18.

Armed with this information, scientists had for many years searched for the source of blue eyes on the OCA2 gene, but without success.","More recently, a mutation to a separate, nearby gene called HERC2 has been identified as the cause of blue eyes. This alteration switches off OCA2, the gene that determines the amount of the brown pigment melanin that we make. It is thought to have first occurred when humans began to migrate from Africa to Europe, meaning that every person with blue eyes is a descendent of a single early European.","The fact that every blue-eyed person alive today has this same mutation is pretty compelling evidence for this theory, although the identity of the initial mutant remains something of a mystery. To date, the earliest set of sapphire-colored peepers ever found belong to a 7,000-year-old skeleton that was discovered in northern Spain. Naturally, the eyes had long since decayed, however genetic analysis revealed that they would have appeared blue in color."],"targetTitle":"All Blue-Eyed People Have This One Thing In Common","targetDescription":"Every blue-eyed person on the planet is descended from a single European who lived around 6,000\u00a0to 10,000 years ago, and who first developed a specific mut","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-environment.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ilss-logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/14eb813a-5314-5cd3-b022-00d93b599aba\/default-1464383304-257-all-blue-eyed-people-have-this-one-thing-in-common.jpg","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316330&cs=c58cc2de06&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo_narrow.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318083&cs=075600f372&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=18981470&cv=2.0&cj=1","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/iflscience_logo.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318082&cs=f932d0946b&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316414&cs=6c4ace3c1f&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316406&cs=69f403dc56&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316385&cs=24a66e6205&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-space.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/ifls-placeholder.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316354&cs=07106bb0fd&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=23fc1c635f&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-technology.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538316331&cs=ff36d3abd8&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318062&cs=d6f5031c43&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/iflscience-d.openx.net\/w\/1.0\/ai?auid=538318081&cs=87fb1c7e69&cb=1487690647","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-plants-and-animals.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-editors-blog.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/images\/19d83c49-0204-5ea9-ae40-aeedf26a99b4\/author_large-1465220073-ben-taub.jpg","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-the-brain.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-chemistry.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-health-and-medicine.png?v=1.2.0","http:\/\/cdn.iflscience.com\/assets\/site\/img\/icon-physics.png?v=1.2.0"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/www.iflscience.com\/plants-and-animals\/all-blue-eyed-people-have-common-ancestor-0\/","id":276}

But for more than a century, the seventh inning stretch has been one of baseball's most cherished moments, exemplifying the humor, sportsmanship and love of tradition that make the sport unique.","Here are five reasons why baseball wouldn't be the same without this random, joyful moment.","THE MUSIC","Aside from the national anthem at the beginning of most sporting events, no piece of music is so deeply associated with a specific moment in sports. It was written by Jack Norworth, who had a successful career in show business starring on Broadway in the early 1900s before also appearing in several sound films.","THE MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS","The origins of the seventh inning stretch are lost to the shadows of history. One popular story dates back to the days of President William Howard Taft, who was attending a game in 1910 and stood up during the middle of the seventh inning to stretch his legs. Naturally (the story goes) when all of the other fans in attendance saw Taft stand, they followed suit.","Another theory about the tradition's origins cites an 1869 issue of the New York Herald, which documented a game in which the entire crowd simply stood up after a brutally long second inning of play, thus inventing \"the stretch\" (albeit a bit earlier in the game). Other competing accounts are out there, but no conclusive proof.","President William Howard Taft throws out the first ball to open a baseball season in history in Washington in April of 1910. (Photo by Mark Rucker\/Transcendental Graphics, Getty Images)","THE CAMARADERIE","Dave Ferguson, a baseball enthusiast and the radio host of \"Beyond the Cheers,\" believes that no matter which origin story you prefer, the seventh inning stretch remains as integral to the game as anything.","\"It's actually taken on its own life, depending on the team,\" Ferguson told HuffPost. \"The players look at it as a break from the game itself. And it's appreciated by the fans.\"","Tony La Russa: \"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history.\" (AP)","THE TRADITION","\"The seventh inning stretch is another tie to our history,\" Tony La Russa, the three-time World Series-winning manager, told The Huffington Post. La Russa believes that the stretch helps to remind players and fans of the game's roots, which is especially valuable even as other things change, such as the structure of the playoffs or the addition of instant replay.","THE RELIEF","Baseball is physically and mentally grueling. The lack of a game clock, the open-ended nature of every game, its division into turn-based innings rather than periods or quarters -- all these elements contribute to baseball's unique flow. The 162 games of the regular season are played over about 185 days, plus the seven weeks of spring training and the playoffs. During the season, players work daily on their physical conditioning in the weight room, batting cage or bullpen, and they are constantly reviewing video for tendencies.","Ichiro Suzuki, the New York Yankees outfielder and future Hall of Famer, told The Huffington Post a few weeks ago that he took a mere three days off after his 13th season before resuming hitting duties.","And the games themselves may be getting longer, making the seventh inning stretch even more of necessity for players. According to MLB.com, the average time for a nine-inning game in the 1970s was around two hours and 30 minutes. During the 2000s however, that time had increased by a full 20 minutes. This past season, the average game time tied the all-time high of two hours, 58 minutes. And during those nearly three hours, actual baseball happens for only 18 minutes -- including balls in play and wild pitches -- according to a study by The Wall Street Journal.","Relive The Longest Game In Baseball History:","Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report.

(If you don't agree, I'm sorry, but I don't understand you.) Now, scientists have gone and done something incredibly cool\u2014they figured out a new way to cook the grain that could cut its calories in half...or more.","New research was presented at the 249th National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society, and revealed that adding a teaspoon of coconut oil to boiling water with a half-cup of non-fortified white rice, letting it simmer for 20 to 40 minutes, then refrigerating it for 12 hours may reduce the number of calories your body takes in by 50 to 60 percent.","Like I said: Seriously cool.","The researchers explained that rice contains two kinds of starch\u2014one that is easily digestible, and one that's resistant. Our bodies don't have the enzymes needed to digest the resistant kind, which means it can't break down that starch and transform it into the sugar that typically gets absorbed into the bloodstream. If you have extra sugar in your bloodstream, that gets turned into fat, which we know is no good. In other words, the scientists wanted to find a way to get the rice to have more resistant starch, rather than digestible ones, to avoid that extra sugar in the body.","This is where the coconut oil comes in. Adding it to the cooking process makes the starch granules resistant to the action of digestive enzymes, and then letting the rice cool for 12 hours pushes the process along. Translation: Same amount of rice, fewer calories into the body.","Bonus: You don't have to eat the rice cold to get the desired effect. Reheating it the next day won't affect results, the researchers found.","No word yet on whether it works on brown rice, or if other oils will do the same thing, but more testing will be done to figure all that good stuff out. For now, we'll just continue to sing the praises of coconut oil as we dig in to a bowl of rice totally guilt-free."],"targetTitle":"The Crazy Cooking Hack that Slashes the Calories in Rice by Half","targetDescription":"You just need a smidge of oil.","targetKeywords":"coconut oil","targetMedia":["https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/jsp\/graph.jsp?graphdata=550_27_1996:-1:000000000000_1997:-1:000000000000_1998:-1:000000000000_1999:-1:000000000000_2000:-1:000000000000_2001:-1:000000000000_2002:-1:000000000000_2003:-1:000000000000_2004:-1:000000000000_2005:-1:000000000000_2006:-1:000000000000_2007:-1:000000000000_2008:-1:000000000000_2009:-1:000000000000_2010:-1:000000000000_2011:-1:000000000000_2012:-1:000000000000_2013:-1:000000000000_2014:-1:000000000000_2015:-1:000000000000_2016:8:000000111000_2017:-1:000000000000","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wm_tb_prv_on.png","http:\/\/del.h-cdn.co\/assets\/15\/14\/980x490\/landscape-1427810609-landscape-1427728883-landscape-1427310035-479665925.jpg","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wayback-toolbar-logo.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160903161628im_\/http:\/\/del.h-cdn.co\/assets\/delish\/20160901143501\/images\/blank.png","https:\/\/web.archive.org\/static\/images\/toolbar\/wm_tb_nxt_off.png"],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20160903161628\/http:\/\/www.delish.com\/food\/a41779\/the-cooking-hack-for-healthier-rice\/?src=socialflowFB","id":280}

Still, that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t love you.","The truth is that cats feel just as much affection for their humans as their canine counterparts. They just say \"I love you\" a little differently... and often in the strangest ways possible.","1. There are many theories about why cats knead their paws into you, but many researchers agree that they\u2019re trying to return the affection that you\u2019re showing them. They just don\u2019t know that it actually hurts.","2. Sure, it\u2019s kind of gross when cats bring dead animals into the house, but they do it because they consider you family \u2013 and they\u2019re trying to teach you how to catch your own prey.","3. When cats rub their head against you, they\u2019re marking you as one of their own with the concentrated scent glands in their cheeks and head. Congratulations, you\u2019re family.","4. A cat\u2019s unending stare can be a little bit disconcerting, but don\u2019t fret. First of all, they\u2019re not really staring. Their eyes are evolved to blink less frequently than ours. But more than that, a steady, soft gaze means that they feel safe and comfortable with you.","5. Like most creatures, cats don\u2019t like to make themselves vulnerable. So if they roll over and present their belly to you, it\u2019s a sign of unwavering trust.","6. Your cat\u2019s tail is a strong indicator of their mood. The higher they carry it, the more content and happy they are. And if they\u2019re feeling really affectionate, they\u2019ll wrap it around you.","7. Cats nip and nibble at us all the time, but it\u2019s far from an aggressive gesture. Cats do the same when they\u2019re grooming their kittens, so it\u2019s much more likely that they think of you with the same affection.","8. Much like with head-butting, cats will run between your legs to mark you with their scent.","9. If you can get your cat purring, it means that they\u2019re very happy with you and with what you\u2019re doing.","10. It may be annoying sometimes, but when your cat follows you absolutely everywhere from room to room, it\u2019s just a sign that they like you and want to be where you are.","See?

{"postId":"815346809346420736","postText":["How to vacation like Taylor Swift, Madonna and more of the world's wealthiest celebs:"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":[" Want to vacation like a celeb? Casa Elizabeth, the Palm Springs villa once owned by Elizabeth Taylor, is now available for rent by model-turned-mogul Kathy Ireland. (Photo courtesy of Kathy Ireland Weddings and Resorts)","So when you're Oprah Winfrey and you're the richest female celebrity in America and you have a net worth of $2.8 billion (yes, BILLION), where do you go when you want to get away from it all? The famous talk show host's travel picks might surprise you.","Today, Forbes released its first-ever ranking of the wealthiest American celebrities, giving a peek into the bank accounts of some of the richest people on the planet. Most interesting to us here at Women@Forbes are the women on the list: self-made celebs for whom money is no object and who travel in private planes, sail on sleek yachts, stay in expensive villas and own multimillion-dollar vacation homes.","Because we are travel obsessed, we decided to take a look at how the other half   actually, the top 1% of the 1%   spends their vacation time.","Women In The Forbes Top 20","Oprah Winfrey's horse farm in California. (Photo courtesy of Sage Auctions\/Lands of America)","Oprah Winfrey: net worth $2.8 billion","The richest woman on the Forbes list has deemed 2017 the Year of Adventure in the January 2017 issue of O. For the cover story of the magazine, Oprah Winfrey even jetted off to one of the nation's most dramatic natural wonders: the Grand Canyon. And yet, she confesses in the magazine's pages that she's actually a homebody. It makes sense: Earlier this year Winfrey bought a $28.9 million equestrian ranch in California. On the 42-acre property is a 4,800-square-foot house with four fireplaces and a pool, plus plenty of horse stables and riding rings. This isn't Winfrey's only cushy crash pad: She also owns a $14 million mountaintop ski chalet in Telluride, Colorado with its own wine mine, as well as over-the-top properties in Santa Barbara, California, and Maui. ","Madonna walks along a street in Havana. (Photo courtesy of YAMIL LAGE\/AFP\/Getty Images)","Madonna: net worth $560 million","The next woman on the list is the travel-obsessed Material Girl herself, Madonna. She has made most of her riches due to her concert tours (which have grossed a staggering $1.4 billion). For her birthday this August, Madonna jetted off to Cuba with her children and a group of close friends. They danced on tables at a bar in Havana, toured the city in vintage 1950s cars and stayed at the Hotel Saratoga. In the past year alone, the Queen of Pop has had a number of glamorous trips. She has also been spotted in the southern Italy town of Puglia for a friend's wedding; in the African countries of Kenya and Malawi with her adopted children; and in London, just to name a few. And that's not all: Madonna also owns a horse farm in the tony Hamptons enclave of Bridgehampton, a triple-wide townhouse in Manhattan and she reportedly bought a $20 million penthouse in Tel Aviv. It's no wonder one of Madonna's most famous songs is Holiday   she lives it.","It's no wonder Barbra Streisand escapes to Malibu, with scenery like this. (Photo courtesy of Shutterstock)","Barbra Streisand: net worth $370 million","Record sales have paid off for another singer   Barbra Streisand, who ranks number 19 on the Forbes list, with an impressive $370 million fortune. Her escape of choice: a clifftop oceanfront compound in the California beach town of Malibu, where Barbra has her own personal shopping arcade that includes stores where she can display her collections of antiques. The singer and her husband James Brolin also like to escape to places like the Spanish island of Mallorca and St. Tropez on the French Riviera.","The living room of Casa Elizabeth, which Kathy Ireland rents out in Palm Springs. (Photo courtesy of Kathy Ireland Worldwide)","Kathy Ireland: net worth $360 million","Model-turned-mogul Kathy Ireland ranks number 20 on the list, thanks to her licensing empire Kathy Ireland Worldwide. Among her many business ventures, Ireland rents out a group of homes, so anyone can vacation just like the supermodel herself. One noteworthy property is Casa Elizabeth, the Palm Springs estate that used to belong to Elizabeth Taylor and has been dubbed The Jewel of the Desert. Ireland originally designed the four-bedroom five-bath property for Taylor. Other locations for Ireland's staggeringly beautiful vacation villas: Greece, Hawaii and Fiji.","Beyond The Top 20","Here are a few more female celebs who didn't make the top 20 list, but are wildly wealthy and definitely know how to travel in style.","The exterior of Inn BoonsBoro. (Photo courtesy of Inn BoonsBoro)","Nora Roberts: net worth $350 million","Red-hot romance novelist Nora Roberts writes five or more books a year that really rake it in. Ireland is one of her favorite retreats, naturally: A number of her books are set there. Roberts has also helped turn her hometown of Boonsboro, Maryland   a rural village near Antietam   into a vacation destination in its own right. She owns two restaurants, a bookstore in a pre-Civil War building called Turn the Page, a gift shop and Inn BoonsBoro, a hotel with rooms named for literary couples like Jane and Rochester from Jane Eyre.","The Montage Beverly Hills, where Judge Judy owns a condo. (Photo courtesy of Montage Beverly Hills)","Judge Judy: net worth $330 million","With a growing portfolio of luxurious vacation homes across the U.S., you could say TV's top judge (real name, Judith Sheimdlin) has another career: real-estate mogul. Her new $8.9 million mansion in Naples, Florida mansion is more like a resort, with multiple bedrooms, a lagoon and three waterfalls, no less. She also owns a nine-bedroom manor house in Greenwich, Connecticut; a five-bedroom condo at the luxe Montage Beverly Hills hotel; and an $8.5 million duplex penthouse in Manhattan. It's hard to imagine she has any free time with so many residences, but Judge Judy has also been known to strut her stuff in spots like the Exumas, a chain of islands in the Bahamas.","A view of the mansion that Danielle Steele owns in San Francisco. (Photo courtesy of Kenneth Lu\/Flickr)","Danielle Steele: net worth $320 million","Romance novel writing clearly pays off. Danielle Steele lives in one of San Francisco's most over-the-top residences: the Spreckels Mansion, an opulent 55-room Beaux Arts manse. Rumor has it that Steele has so many parties that she bought 25 parking spots in the neighborhood to accommodate all her friends' cars.","Taylor Swift's home in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. (Photo courtesy of KCT\/STAR MAX\/IPx 7\/24\/14 \/AP)","Taylor Swift: net worth $255 million","Millennial pop star Taylor Swift sure knows how to enjoy her down time.

{"postId":"664511746397315072","postText":["This U.S. city is welcoming veterans with an innovative new program"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Fred Johnson is effusive.","After a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves.","I can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville.","\"You\u2019ve gotta come, dude -- it\u2019s awesome,\" Johnson told me. \"This is an up-and-coming town.\"","But Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program.","Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world.","Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families.","Visions of America\/Getty Images The Louisville, Kentucky, skyline.","Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville.","So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that.","The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers.","Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017.","Filling A Void","The transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army\u2019s Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world.","The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with \"everything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a re\u0301sume\u0301 and job preparation.\"","Connecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army\u2019s work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site.","Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com.","In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of \"regional veteran connectors\" -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues.","I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program","Herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox.","\"The Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get \u2018em introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation,\" Herd said. \"The preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. I\u2019m excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community.\"","The feeling is mutual. For Kentucky\u2019s business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking.","\"As economic developers, workforce is a challenge,\" said Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of Where Opportunity Knox. \"We have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we\u2019ve gotten past the recession, we\u2019re starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills.\"","The population of the greater Louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the Great Recession.","Unemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today. That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today.","Daniel Marans Retired Col. Walter Herd is director of the Army's Transition Assistance Program.","The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. The city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector.","Louisville proper is home to UPS\u2019 Worldport air hub, as well as two Ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant Humana. And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker\u2019s Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.","Army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region\u2019s businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist.","For one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place.","Soldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science.","But more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the \"attributes\" that service instills, Herd said. Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox\u2019s walls to return to the civilian world.","And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators.","\"The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble,\" Herd said. \"So we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.\"","The military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they\u2019re healthy, they stay out of trouble. Retired Col. Walter Herd, director, Army Transition Assistance Program","The Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New Initiative","Pickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army\u2019s training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas.","It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation.","\"What was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn\u2019t happen somewhere else,\" Pickett said.","To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn\u2019t they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS?","\"I wish every American could go through there,\" Pickett said. \"I was just inspired by it.\"","Daniel Marans Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant, co-founded Where Opportunity Knox.","Translating \"Army-Speak\" To \"Corporate-Speak\"","Given how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate.","But unemployment among young, post-9\/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers.","In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9\/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9\/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.)","The reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers\u2019 stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects.","There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military\u2019s separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today\u2019s economy.","Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world.","The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army\/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable. Kathy Robinson, founder, Turning Point","Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work.","\"Veterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs,\" Robinson said. \"The hard part comes in translating those skills from Army\/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable.\"","In fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers.","Fred Johnson Fred Johnson volunteers with Healing and the Arts to help younger veterans cope with PTSD.","\"You Can Actually See The Community Change.\"","Johnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army.","Given Johnson\u2019s worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description.","That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox.","They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville\u2019s underprivileged schools. Johnson is now the organization\u2019s director of workplace giving.","\"I had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that,\" Johnson said. \"They helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense.\"","Through his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville. He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it.","I tell them, 'Follow your heart, not the money.' You can actually see the community change. Fred Johnson, Army veteran and director of workplace giving, Fund for the Arts","\"When we attacked that city it was like a wasteland,\" Johnson said. \"Then we helped rebuild the city. We are trying to do that here in Louisville. On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba.\"","In addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work.","\"The vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don\u2019t do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority,\" Johnson added. \"The west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits.\"","But Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.","\"I told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it,\" Johnson said. \"I said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative. She took a chance on me. I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage.\"","And prove himself Johnson has. Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville\u2019s top 20 veterans in business.","Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing. The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD.","\"I tell them, \u2018Follow your heart, not the money,\" Johnson said. \"You can actually see the community change.\"","Where Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career. He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it.","\"A lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they\u2019ve learned,\" he observed. \"They are 21 years old -- I say, \u2018No, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span. You just don\u2019t realize how many tools you have.\u2019\""],"targetTitle":"This U.S. City Is Welcoming Veterans With An Innovative New Program","targetDescription":"The Where Opportunity Knox initiative is connecting Army veterans to jobs and community life in the greater Louisville, Kentucky, area.","targetKeywords":"U.S. city welcoming veterans,where opportunity knox,louisville kentucky,Louisville,fort knox,Veterans Day,veterans unemployment,post-9\/11 veterans,fred johnson,fund for the arts,What's Working","targetMedia":["http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/2000_1000\/56411e621400006f023ca4e0.jpeg?cache=3f4xljz7gh","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/crop_0_3_960_529,scalefit_720_noupscale\/56411e621400006f023ca4e0.jpeg?cache=3f4xljz7gh","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/,scalefit_950_800_noupscale\/563d14e81800002a0030413a.jpeg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/crop_0_140_2448_1895,scalefit_720_noupscale\/56412219290000d7004dc8c2.jpeg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/crop_14_224_3250_2224,scalefit_720_noupscale\/564120d31400006f023ca4e2.jpeg","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/crop_7_273_3257_2175,scalefit_720_noupscale\/56412081290000da004dc8c0.jpeg","http:\/\/img.huffingtonpost.com\/asset\/scalefit_720_noupscale\/5641226d180000a7003043b9.jpeg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1WRVU7E","id":284}

As the opening credits rolled, a subtle but important change was made to the animation, causing fans of the show to shout with glee. Did you miss it? Observant viewers spotted it right away.","Prior to Sunday\u2019s finale, the castle at Winterfell was adorned with the gruesome Bolton sigil, which is a picture of a flayed man hanging upside-down. It\u2019s a nasty image but one that\u2019s meant to strike fear into the Bolton\u2019s enemies; the house was infamous for the centuries-old practice, and because Ramsay had taken over Winterfell, the sigil was prominently displayed in the show\u2019s opening credits.","But as of Sunday\u2019s finale, the Stark sigil was back in its rightful place. It was a subtle change but a big moment for the show because of how important \"Battle of the Bastards\" was. Fans were understandably pumped about the change; all seems right in the Game of Thrones universe\u2014at least for now.","Also notable is that it reflects Jon\u2019s newfound status as King in the North. Because Jon is thought to be a bastard, custom dictates the colors of the sigil be reversed. Instead of a gray direwolf on a white background, it\u2019s now a white wolf on a gray background. Not an insignificant change, especially because Jon\u2019s new nickname is White Wolf.","With winter finally here, can Jon ensure the survival of Winterfell? Unfortunately, it\u2019ll be many months before the show returns for season 7, so we have a long way until we find out."],"targetTitle":"Game of Thrones: Did you catch this subtle change during the finale?","targetDescription":"Game of Thrones made an important change to the opening credits in last night's season finale.

The spring color worked surprisingly well on all the different models' skin tones, however, it stood out particularly on the redheads.","With such a vibrant eyeshadow color on the lids, it is key to keep the rest of the face pared down. Romy Soleimani for Beauty.com achieved this at Lela Rose by using a combination of Stila Color Pigments in Light Show and Cha Cha Eyeshadow on the eyes.

Judge grew up in Linden, California, about two hours from what was then Pac Bell Park.","\"I was a Giants fan and that was the time he was putting up 70 homers a year,\" said Judge, who's now a 6-foot-7, 282-pound right fielder for the New York Yankees. \"That was pretty impressive to watch as a kid.\"","On Wednesday, Judge will celebrate his 25th birthday by playing his first game in the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry. He will step to the plate as a rookie sensation; his six homers are tied for the second most in the American League.","But it's not just about how many balls he has hit over the fence -- it's how far he has hit them. Judge is challenging the current champ, Giancarlo Stanton, as the king of the XXXL home run.","Judge\u2019s 460-foot homer on Saturday in Pittsburgh was the third longest for a Yankee since ESPN started tracking distances in 2009. Only Alex Rodriguez's 477-foot homer in August 2015 and Juan Miranda's 469-foot shot in October 2009 traveled farther. In the past two seasons, Judge has three of the four longest Yankee homers. Only Chase Headley, with a 453-footer in July 2016, cracks the top four. Headley believes he got all of that one, but he said he and his teammates are eager to see what would happen if everything clicks in perfectly for Judge.","\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it,\" Headley said. \"I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"","Starlin Castro, who is usually in the same batting practice group as Judge, has never been big on watching teammates or opponents take BP. He remembers being around Stanton in the Arizona Fall League in 2009 and taking a few glances, but besides that, Castro said he has never been much of a gawker -- until now.","\"He is the first guy,\" Castro said. \"I\u2019m really happy we are in the same group. It is really motivating. It is really fun to watch. We feel like every swing he takes, something big is going to happen.\"","Matt Holliday, on the other hand, has always studied standout teammates and opponents in BP as if there'd be an exam afterward. It's not just tape-measure specialists, but contact guys too. Holliday looks for any little ingredient he can add to his game, making the 37-year-old slugger as qualified as anyone to weigh in on Judge\u2019s power.","\"We are all just waiting for that time where everything just syncs up and he gets every bit of it ... I want to see him do that. He is just a humongous human being that has out-of-this-world power. Five-hundred fifty feet is not out of the question. If there is nothing in the way, he is hitting it 550.\"","\"There aren\u2019t many guys that can hit the ball as far as him in batting practice, if any,\" Holliday said. \"Obviously, Stanton is the easy one that comes to mind that I\u2019ve played against. Barry Bonds, too.\"","Holliday has seen Stanton do his damage only as an opponent, while he receives a daily dose of Judge. He said it might just be familiarity, but he would take Judge in a distance contest.","Mark Teixeira, who just completed a 14-year career in which he swatted 409 homers, said he used to watch Nelson Cruz launch some balls in the Arlington heat when they were teammates in Texas. In 2013, Teixeira played with Stanton in the World Baseball Classic.","\"Judge\u2019s power is right there with those two guys,\" said Teixeira, now an ESPN analyst.","In 2016, Judge struck out in 42 of his 84 at-bats, a performance so bad it made the Yankees hesitant to hand him the right-field job in spring training, even with a full winter endorsement from team owner Hal Steinbrenner. In the final days, the Yankees finally gave Judge the nod over Aaron Hicks. Judge has struck out 17 times in 61 at-bats thus far.","\"I knew it was going to take some time for him to get used to minor league pitching and big league pitching and really grow into his swing, because he is a big guy and he has to grow into his strike zone,\" Teixeira said. \"The smarter he has gotten about swinging at certain pitches and the more ready he is at the plate, he looks like he is so dangerous right now. He is exactly where you would hope he would be when I saw him a few years ago.\"","It's early, but Judge has joined Stanton as a player you can\u2019t miss. His power, like Bonds in his prime, makes it nearly impossible to look away. He's the type of player little kids will be running to their televisions to see."],"targetTitle":"King of the tape-measure home run?

Iulian Valentin\/Shutterstock","If processed foods are addictive, scientists have argued, it should be possible to create an addictiveness scale to find the crack cocaine among common meals. Surprising as it may seem, their answer isn't chocolate.","\"We propose that highly processed foods share pharmacokinetic properties (e.g. concentrated dose, rapid rate of absorption) with drugs of abuse, due to the addition of fat and\/or refined carbohydrates and the rapid rate the refined carbohydrates are absorbed into the system,\" write graduate student Erica Schulte and Dr. Ashley Gearhardt of the University of Michigan in PLOS ONE","The authors characterize addictiveness by factors such as \"loss of control over consumption, continued use despite negative consequences, and an inability to cut down despite the desire to do so.\" They back up their claims with a study of 504 participants, who helped them assess which foods are hardest to resist.","\"Although the causes of obesity are multifactorial, one potential contributing factor is the idea certain foods may be capable of triggering an addictive response in some individuals, which may lead to unintended overeating,\" the authors write.","To test the differences between foods, the authors had 120 undergraduate students fill out the Yale Food Addiction Scale , of which Gearhardt was one of the original authors, to determine the individuals' substance dependence. The students were then shown pictures of 35 common foods, presented in pairs, and asked to say which they considered more likely to produce addiction-like eating behaviors.","Unsurprisingly, foods dense in fat and glycemic load (the amount of carbohydrate in a food multiplied by how swiftly it is converted to sugar) topped the scale. As the authors note, drinks with higher concentrations of alcohol are more addictive than their more diffuse counterparts. The finding is also consistent with animal studies, which highlight the role of dopamine, our brain's \"pleasure chemical\" that's often implicated in addiction. For instance, rats fed a diet consisting of highly processed foods showed changes to the brain's dopamine system that's also seen in response to illicit drugs.","The respondents were segmented in order to explore how gender and body mass index (BMI) alter the difficulty to resist particular food components. Gender was not found to be relevant; people with high BMIs reported addictive-like attraction to more foods, although the correlation was not as strong as might be expected.","Chocolate came up most often, followed by ice cream and french fries.","However, the authors were not convinced they had solved the question of which food is the most craving-inducing. A further 384 people were asked online to rate the addictiveness of each food on a scale of 1 to 7. Using this larger (and more representative) sample, the clear winner was pizza, with a mean score of 4.01, followed by chocolate and chips sharing second at 3.73. Several other foods \u2013 all highly processed and rich in sugar, fat or both \u2013 were tightly bunched behind. At the bottom of the addictiveness scale came cucumber, carrots and beans. Even water ranked higher than these.","Strangely, however, while the study included soda and water, coffee was not offered among the 35 choices. A match-up between caffeine and pizza\u2019s salt\/sugar\/fat will have to wait for another time."],"targetTitle":"According To Science, This Is The Most Addictive Food In The

Utilities typically run between $48 and $79 per month, so it's definitely possible to make your retirement savings stretch.","7. Malaysia \u00a9 Richard I'Anson\/Getty Images Malaysia's people are just as warm as the weather, and this is the kind of place where outsiders are easily welcomed into the fold. As far as the cost of living goes, Malaysia is roughly 44% cheaper than the U.S. Housing is an especially good deal, with rent prices that are 69% lower than what you'd find here at home. Retirees can apply for a long-term visa through the Malaysia My Second Home Program.

Mounting evidence has linked an unhealthy gut microbiota with inflammatory bowel disease, allergies, neurodegenerative diseases and metabolic diseases including obesity and diabetes.","This new study is one of the first to suggest that not getting enough sleep is one way of making our gut bacteria unhealthy, Cedernaes explained. ","The researchers followed nine individuals who spent two nights sleeping in a lab for eight and a half hours, and then another two nights of sleeping in a lab for only four and a half hours.","The study included a fairly small number of people, but the strength behind the data is that the researchers were able to compare the effects of varied sleep levels on gut bacteria within the same individuals. Plus, they only included subjects who reported having gotten consistent sleep and regularly timed meals the week before the study, which meant everyone\u2019s gut bacteria started out at a somewhat typical level.","The data showed that getting less sleep didn\u2019t necessarily change which gut bacteria the individuals had. But getting less sleep did change the levels of specific strains of bacteria. The amount of certain types of bacteria decreased by nearly 50 percent \u2015 and that was after only two nights of not getting enough sleep.","The finding was significant because the wrong balance of bacteria in our gut is thought to be one of the big factors that cause obesity in some individuals, Cedernaes explained. ","What\u2019s more, the ratios of specific strands of gut bacteria observed after individuals had not gotten a full night\u2019s sleep mirrored the levels of the same gut bacteria previously observed in people who were obese or had other metabolic diseases.","\"Gut bacteria are a crucial, natural component of our bodies,\" Cedernaes said. \"[They] break down fibers that we cannot digest otherwise. They can also help us extract nutrients.\" ","There was yet another interesting finding from the study. The individuals were 20 percent less sensitive to the effects of insulin after having less sleep \u2015 a potential diabetes risk \u2015 compared to the days after the nights they had slept longer. ","Sleep loss has been linked to decreased insulin sensitivity in previous studies, Cedernaes said. And while his new research did not necessarily suggest the effect was a result of the gut bacteria changes, the link is still an important observation because over time, constant insulin insensitivity is a well-established driver of diabetes. ","Additional, longer studies will be necessary to prove that the gut bacteria changes observed after a few nights of insufficient sleep are linked with the various metabolic diseases thought to be connected to chronic sleep loss, like obesity, diabetes and heart disease. But the new data makes a strong case, Cedernaes said \u2015 a strong case for catching your Zs."],"targetTitle":"The Terrifying Way Not Sleeping Enough Actually Changes Your Gut","targetDescription":"It could be upping your risk of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.","targetKeywords":"Sleep,obesity,Diabetes,gut bacteria","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":293}
{"postId":"844055485385003008","postText":["9 ways the new \"Beauty and the Beast\" is different from the original"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["As everyone returned to work Monday morning, it\u2019s safe to assume rooms were buzzing with discussions about the highly anticipated \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake that debuted over the weekend.","Some may have been covering their ears, while others thoroughly examined each and every detail -- good or bad -- of the live-action update of the 1991 animated classic.","So how did the remake compare to the original?","Well, that\u2019s still up for interpretation, but one thing is clear: There were many plot twists and updates that gave the newly released \"Beauty and Beast\" a completely different feel from the original.","Questions were answered, characters changed and some key scenes and moments in the film made the remake stand out -- not simply as a copycat but as a film that can stand on its own.","Here\u2019s a look at nine ways the \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake differed from the original:","Warning: This post contains spoilers.","In the remake, Belle (Emma Watson) is more than a bold, beautiful bookworm and devoted daughter -- she\u2019s also a teacher and inventor.","It\u2019s clear Belle is one of the only literate women in town. While other women are more concerned with clothing and beauty, Belle\u2019s nose is buried deep in a book -- and she\u2019s not ashamed of it. In fact, in the film she even tries to teach another young girl how to read before being ridiculed by residents of the town for doing so.","She held this impromptu lesson while doing her laundry. Rather than washing the clothes by hand, Belle attached a barrel to a mule and had the animal walk around in circles around a well, creating a washing machine, likely unseen before in the town.","In the original \"Beauty and the Beast,\" the audience simply knows \"crazy Maurice\" (Kevin Kline) as a widower and Belle as his apparent caretaker. It was never clear who Belle\u2019s mother was or what happened to her.","But thanks to the remake, those questions have finally been answered. With a little help from a magical book -- courtesy of the enchantress who cursed him -- the Beast (Dan Stevens) and Belle travel back in time to Paris, where Belle was born. The pair are transported into a tiny, disheveled studio apartment with a view of a busy street. It\u2019s \"much smaller\" than Belle imagined. It\u2019s here the Beast tells Belle what happened to her mother.","After spotting a doctor\u2019s mask on the floor, the Beast concludes Belle\u2019s mother died from the plague. A flashback between Maurice and Belle\u2019s mom (Zoe Rainey), sick in bed, saying their farewells proves this to be the case. The woman tells Maurice to take Belle away so she doesn\u2019t catch the disease as well. So he does, and the rest is history.","The Beast was a rich prince, pompous and entitled -- but he wasn\u2019t always that way. In the 1991 animated movie, the audience assumes the Beast was born like that, his attitude simply accompanying the crown. In the remake, we found out that\u2019s not entirely the case.","While Belle asks Mrs. Potts (Emma Thompson) and some others why they remain loyal to the Beast, they explain that they failed him when he was a boy. The Beast lost his mother at a young age, and the castle staff said his cruel father kept him away from her while she was on her deathbed. Therefore, they feel responsible for his behavior, because they never \"protected\" him from his dad, who they say turned him into a \"Beast\" well before his physical transformation.","It\u2019s true. Lyrics to one of the movie\u2019s most popular songs, \"Gaston,\" sounded a little different than the original. While they were new to moviegoers, \"Beauty and the Beast\" composer Alan Menken said they weren\u2019t technically \"new\" -- they were simply unused lyrics by the late Howard Ashman that didn\u2019t make the cut in the original film.","\"[They\u2019re] not actually new lyrics, they\u2019re actually Howard Ashman\u2019s that were outtake things,\" Menken told ComicBook prior to the premiere in Los Angeles. \"We had also put some of the outtake lyrics from Howard in the Broadway show. And the reason that they hadn\u2019t been used in the animated was that they were quite edgy.\"","For example, the added lyric \"I hunt, I sneak up with my quiver and I shoot in the liver\" was too edgy for an animated film, but for this one, Menken said it was perfect.","Unlike in the original, the new Beast is highly educated, boasting about his expensive education while quoting Shakespeare and critiquing Belle\u2019s admiration for \"Romeo and Juliet.\"","This is a sharp contrast from the original movie, where a bored and seemingly illiterate Beast needed Belle\u2019s help sounding out words in the books. The Beast is anything but bored with the books and agrees with Belle that his huge library really is wonderful. The Beast doesn\u2019t need any help reading a book, and Belle even catches his reading a romance alone in the garden at one point.","What happened to Mrs. Potts\u2019 children, Chip\u2019s brothers and sisters? While Chip (Nathan Mack) has always been front and center, it was made clear in the 1991 movie that he wasn\u2019t alone.","In the original film, Mrs. Potts told Chip to join his brothers and sisters in the cabinet. This time around, Chip tucked himself in within an empty cabinet late at night with no explanation as to whether he had any siblings. We assume, this time around, he\u2019s Mrs. Potts\u2019 only child.","Not cool, Gaston (Luke Evans). While trying to win the affection of his \"future father-in-law,\" Gaston pretends to believe Maurice\u2019s warning that a strange Beast has taken his daughter, Belle, captive. So he and LeFou (Josh Gad) take a horse and carriage out in the middle of the night, asking Maurice to lead the way.","When Maurice approaches the path to the Beast\u2019s castle, he discovers a tree that had been knocked down by lightning standing upright again. Gaston and LeFou exchange glances, implying that Maurice has lost it, and tell him it\u2019s time to turn around. But Maurice refuses, explaining that they should head toward the right. Gaston loses his temper with Maurice and says he only entertained Maurice\u2019s wild story because he wants to ask for his daughter\u2019s hand in marriage. When Maurice says that will never happen, Gaston realizes Maurice will just get in his way, so he knocks him out and ties him to a tree, leaving him to the wolves.","LeFou, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of leaving Maurice for dead, pleads with Gaston to reconsider, but Gaston pushes forward and returns to town without Maurice. Little does he know, Maurice will beat him back to town, telling locals the story about how Gaston left him there to die. If only they believed him...","The live-action \"Beauty and the Beast\" remake made history by featuring Disney\u2019s first-ever \"exclusively gay moment.\" In the new film, Josh Gad\u2019s character, LeFou -- Gaston\u2019s best friend and confidant -- was presented differently than the 1991 animated version.","\"LeFou is somebody who on one day wants to be Gaston and on another day wants to kiss Gaston,\" director Bill Condon told Attitude magazine. \"He\u2019s confused about what he wants. It\u2019s somebody who\u2019s just realising that he has these feelings.\"","At one point in the film, Gaston asks LeFou why he doesn\u2019t have a lady. LeFou shrugs his shoulders and says he\u2019s \"too clingy.\" At the end of the movie, LeFou is dancing at a big celebration inside the castle with Belle and the prince. He starts out dancing with a woman, but soon switches to partner with one of Gaston\u2019s henchmen, who, earlier in the film, was pleased when the enchanted wardrobe dressed him in a puffy dress, wig and makeup.","In the 1991 animated movie, the Beast has until his 21st birthday to break the curse. In the remake, there\u2019s no set deadline -- he simply just has to find true love before \"the last petal falls,\" referring to the enchanted rose.","And in the 2017 remake, that last petal does fall and the Beast -- who was shot by three bullets, rather than by arrows and a knife -- dies as Belle holds him in her arms on the balcony. At that moment, it appears the curse is final. Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumiere (Ewan McGregor) and Cogsworth (Ian McKellen) slowly become inanimate objects and say their final goodbyes. Belle take a long pause before finally telling the Beast she loves him as a tear slowly drips down her cheek.","Behind her stands the transforming enchantress, who originally placed the curse on the Beast and his castle. As she overhears Belle\u2019s last cry, she lifts the curse, bringing the Beast back to life as a man and transforming all of the household objects back to their human selves. The enchantress then disappears without a trace.

The survey, released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University, didn't elaborate on what \"moral\" encompasses.","That could help the Democratic candidate by making her policy positions appear stronger. According to new research, a perception of morality strengthens an argument, giving it more sway than opinions based on tradition or practicality.","In the study, published in the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, Ohio State University doctoral student Andrew Luttrell and his team hypothesized that the people or causes we most admire share a common trait: They're connected to our sense of morality, a psychological shield against outside attacks. As in: Oh, you disagree with me? Well, I won\u2019t be swayed because I\u2019m standing up for what\u2019s right.","The researchers wanted to see if a person\u2019s opinion grew stronger or was more likely to withstand challenges if their viewpoint was declared to be \"moral.\" So, they set up a series of experiments with three groups of roughly 100 participants.","[How Democratic and Republican morals compare to the rest of the world]","Luttrell and his colleagues gave the first group, all college students, information about a new senior exam policy and asked them to write down their thoughts. Next, the participants, separated by partitions, received printed \"feedback\" on their opinions. Some were told their ideas on the phony exam policy reflected \"tradition.\" Others heard their ideas projected \"morality.\"","Like this:","\"While your thoughts were similar to other students' on a variety of dimensions, you seem to have based your thoughts about senior comprehensive exams on morality\/tradition more than the average student.\"","Simply telling someone their attitude was moral, Luttrull found, gave it more power. Compared to those in the \"tradition\" group, the participants who heard their thoughts reflected morality were more likely to say they\u2019d sign a petition to support the bogus policy, put their name on a list of students who support the policy and vote in favor of the policy. They marked their interest in these actions on a scale of one to nine:","In the next two experiments \u2014 one with college students and one with a broader sample of adults \u2014 researchers asked participants to perform a similar task, this time focused on recycling.","The group\u2019s consensus: Recycling is generally a good thing. After respondents wrote down their individual thoughts and took the same nine-point tests, they received feedback on their recycling beliefs. Some heard their views were \"practical.\" Others heard \"moral.\"","Then the researchers tried to change everyone\u2019s mind. They slipped respondents a note that said recycling puts more cars on the road and encourages pollution.","People's attitudes in the \"morality\" group and \"practicality\" group didn't significantly differ before they read the anti-recycling message. But afterward, a post-test revealed the \"moral\" respondents viewed recycling more favorably (7.56 on a nine-point scale) than the \"practical\" respondents (6.88).","\"Those led to believe that their recycling attitudes were grounded in morality were more resistant to the anti-recycling message than those led to believe that their attitudes were grounded in practicality,\" the authors wrote.","The takeaway, according to Luttrell: Framing a cause as \"moral\" is a smart tactic for politicians and advocates. Any issue, it appears, can be viewed through the morality lens, which is why we'll be probably fighting about politics forever.","\"Is moral a magic word?\" he said. \"In some ways, it might be. We grow up thinking morality is this thing that's untouchable. What's moral is permanent and cannot be challenged.\"","Fresh off his Vatican visit, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders visits a church in Brooklyn and says income inequality isn't just a political issue, it's a moral issue.

{"postId":"51qaqu","postText":["Why Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the best possible name for that show"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Today is publication day for TV (THE BOOK): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time, the anthology where Matt Zoller Seitz and I rank the top 100 American sitcoms and dramas ever, and write essays about them, and a whole lot of other things (movies, miniseries, current shows, shows that weren't top 100-worthy but were sentimental favorites in some way, etc.). You can order it in multiple editions (including an audiobook recorded by Matt and me) at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, iBooks, Google Play, Kobo, or your favorite indie bookseller.","We're very proud of the book, and can't wait for people to start reading, but if you still need a taste or two to push you over the buying edge, The Ringer ran an excerpt last week featuring part of our explanation for how the top 100 was chosen, along with our joint essay on Deadwood, while Matt's home base at Vulture this morning has the essay on our top-ranked show, The Simpsons(*).","(*) Maybe my favorite section of the book \u2013 and the favorite of many of the early reviewers \u2013 is called The Great Debate, where Matt and I argue out what should get the top pick after we initially wound up with a five-way tie for first place.","Included below is the essay I wrote about a little show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which finished in a tie for 25th place \u2013 alongside, appropriately enough, fellow classic high school dramas Freaks and Geeks and My So-Called Life \u2013 among our Pantheon of series, coming up just as soon as I get the mustard out...","Buffy the Vampire Slayer (WB, 1997\u20132001; UPN, 2001\u20132003) Total score: 94","TV show titles rarely bring viewers into the tent, but they can keep them out. If you want to give your charming blended-family comedy an ironic name like Trophy Wife, don\"t be surprised if your target demographic takes it literally and stays far away. (See also Terriers, Selfie, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...)","Now, Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran seven seasons, was never in danger of cancellation at any point (it jumped networks after season 5 only because UPN was looking to steal a hit from its rival the WB), launched a long-running (and, eventually, very good) spin-off in Angel, was beloved by its fans, and helped define the identity of an entire TV network for the short but memorable existence of the WB. By any standard you want to measure, Buffy was a success.","Except maybe this one: If you tell someone who\"s never watched it that a show called Buffy the Vampire Slayer is among the best TV dramas of all time, they will roll their eyes at you and change the subject to something less divisive, like immigration policy.","Would a Buffy the Vampire Slayer by any other name have been a crossover hit rather than a cult classic, or won more awards, or simply have been an easier sell to non-fans? Certainly, you can imagine WB executives thinking that, which is why they briefly tried to get Joss Whedon to shorten the title to just Slayer.","Whedon held firm, and not just because it might have created confusion between the show and the thrash band that brought the world songs like \"Reign in Blood\" and \"Mandatory Suicide.\" He knew that Buffy the Vampire Slayer was the perfect title for his series, because it captured the exact spirit of what he was planning to make.","You could give it a more serious or distinguished title, but no matter the packaging, the show inside would be about a vapid teenage girl, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who discovered that her destiny was to protect humankind from vampires, demons, and other creatures of the underworld, and a show whose tone shifted rapidly between horror, melodrama, action, and pure comedy. The name tells you all of that, and suggests that if you\"re turned off by it, you\"re probably not going to like the series to which it\"s applied.","It was a tonal balance that director Fran Rubel Kuzui didn\"t even bother attempting with the campy Buffy movie adapted from Whedon\"s first script. The show, though, would have room for many different emotions, all juggled expertly by Gellar, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan, and the rest of the cast. It was a series made cheaply even by the standards of TV\"s fifth-place network, but it almost never seemed ridiculous despite the primitive effects and awkward stunt-doubling for Gellar. If it wanted to make you laugh at a bit of witty banter (\"I laugh in the face of danger. Then I hide until it goes away.\"), it could. If it wanted its latest monster to creep you out, it found the most disturbing context possible. And if it wanted to make you cry, it was pointless to try fighting it.","If anything, the exaggerated nature of the various undead villains only made the high school setting more effective, because what is adolescence if not a time when every problem gets blown wildly out of proportion?","In the real world, a girl whose boyfriend started treating her badly after they finally have sex wouldn\"t need to worry that he had turned pure evil, as happened with Buffy and her vampire love interest Angel (David Boreanaz), but it might feel that way for a while. And a real teen boy going through the changes of puberty might occasionally imagine himself a monster, but laconic guitar player Oz (Seth Green) actually transformed into a werewolf every time the moon was full.","Turning monsters into metaphors for teenage emotional turmoil was a clever gambit, and one that played particularly well during the show\"s three seasons set in high school. Buffy is (by our rankings, anyway) one of the best TV shows ever set in high school, but it wasn\"t entirely immune to the same problems that eventually beset all such shows when their characters head to college. Even so, those later seasons still had a knack for landing on the right parallel between the supernatural and the universal, like Buffy\"s little sister Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) literally being put on earth to cause her problems (which in this case involved the literal end of the world).","(Those later years also offered some thrilling formal experiments, including \"Hush,\" an homage to silent horror movies, involving demons who rob people of the ability to speak or scream; \"The Body,\" a stripped-down outing where Buffy confronts the mundane reality of her mother\"s death from natural causes; and the musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling,\" where a curse forces everyone to express their feelings through song.)","Back to that title. Whedon once suggested to the New York Times, \"If I made Buffy the Lesbian Separatist, a series of lectures on PBS on why there should be feminism, no one would be coming to the party, and it would be boring. The idea of changing culture is important to me, and it can only be done in a popular medium.\"","Whedon didn\"t invent feminism in TV storytelling, or even the idea of cross-pollinating it with fantasy and sci-fi tropes. (For much of its run, Buffy overlapped with Xena: Warrior Princess.) But he created one of the finest examples of it, and wrapped it up in a wildly entertaining package that included a name that may have made some potential viewers roll their eyes, but that made enough of them smile and think this might just be a show for them.","And it was."],"targetTitle":"TV (THE BOOK): Why \u2018Buffy the Vampire Slayer\u2019 was one of TV\u2019s best shows ever","targetDescription":"In an excerpt from TV (THE BOOK), Alan Sepinwall writes about the greatness of Joss Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" starring Sarah Michelle Gellar.","targetKeywords":"sepinwall, buffy the vampire slayer, tv the book","targetMedia":["http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/photo\/106987\/profile","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=722969591073270&ev=PageView&noscript=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/bmw-feat-uproxx-1.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/analytics.twitter.com\/i\/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0","http:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/hitfixharleyteasuicidesquad.jpgwp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650&h=433","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/150964.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","http:\/\/dbg52463.moatads.com?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8","http:\/\/t.co\/i\/adsct?txn_id=l68nb&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0","http:\/\/pixel.wp.com\/b.gif?v=noscript","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/ryan-murphy.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/nodapl-wells-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/top-chef-feat-uproxx-2.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/weird-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/fastlane-header.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","http:\/\/p.uproxxcdn.com\/content\/default-avatar.jpg","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/08\/tv-the-book-buffy.jpg?quality=100&w=650","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/starter-jacket-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","http:\/\/pixel.quantserve.com\/pixel\/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif","http:\/\/d5i9o0tpq9sa1.cloudfront.net?a=5a7216d001e44d7f8e401aa5705d27f8","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/jeff-sessions-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2016\/11\/alan-sepinwall.jpg?quality=100&w=48","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/carl-ichan-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/future-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/grohlsteen-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/sharp-dressed-man-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/02\/spice-girls-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/ice-ramp-feature.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/chef-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/netflix-theater-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/01\/kevin-gates-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=450&h=315&crop=1","https:\/\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\/2017\/03\/sampha-feat-uproxx.jpg?quality=100&w=300&h=170&crop=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/m.hitfix.com\/whats-alan-watching\/tv-the-book-why-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-was-the-best-possible-name-for-that-show","id":297}

However, according to recent research, this fast-food is also the leading cause for four types of cancer.Hot dogs were introduced by German immigrants in the 19th century and gained their popularity quickly. These days, the hot dog enjoys an iconic status. The WHO (World Health Organization) recently issues a report that suggests all processed meals can cause cancer, including red meat. The hot dogs are made of pork, beef and chicken. Factories often use leftovers from cutting steaks and pork chops as well as edible slaughter by-products such as animal feet or head, fatty tissue and skins.During the process, these ingredients are mixed together, and additives such as sat, corn syrup, nitrates, large amount of salt and chemicals are added. Most of these added ingredients have been continuously linked to cancer.

How do you steer clear? Well, if you've ever watched a horror movie, you'll know to stay out of dark woods, unlit alleyways, and to never, ever go into the basement to investigate that strange noise down there. Oh, and you should probably also avoid prison.","But, sad to say, those steps are unlikely to be enough. Psychology tells us that psychopaths actually walk among us everyday. Research suggests something like 5 percent of people show psychopathic tendencies","These folks aren't necessarily committing crimes, but this small but significant portion of the population does display some essential traits of psychopathy, like lack of empathy, selfishness, lack of guilt, and plenty of charm . And while it's true that there's really nothing you can do to ensure that you never have to deal with everyday psychopaths, apparently there is at least one way you could decrease your chances--you could avoid going into certain professions.","According to a fascinating (if not exactly easily actionable) recent PsyBlog post, psychopaths aren't evenly scattered through the population .

And I am, of course, personally shocked to see journalists here. (I look around at colleagues with newly suspicious eyes.) Also, how did politician not make the list?","The other end of the scale is also interesting but perhaps offers fewer puzzlers.

If you use rosemary externally and combine it with oil, it will relieve symptoms of sciatica, rheumatic pain and muscle soreness.","Since it stimulates the circulation so well, the rosemary accentuates the hair growth and prevents dandruff and hair loss. The rosemary is not for oral use nor should it be given to children. Also, pregnant women are advised to consult their doctor before using it. Usually, small amounts in meals and while cooking are allowed.","You can always prepare tea from the rosemary leaves and flowers which will calm the organism and help it relax.","Moreover, rosemary can annihilate symptoms of depression and reduce menstrual cramps significantly.","To use the rosemary to its best, here are two recipes that will help you:","Take a teaspoon of fresh or dried rosemary and cover it with one cup of boiling water. Leave liquid to steep for 15 minutes and then strain with gauze.","Take two cups per day, in the mornings and in the afternoon. Night dosage is not recommended since it can disturb the sleep.","Rosemary tincture: Mix 1\u20442 cup medicinal alcohol with 1 tablespoon of rosemary leaves. Allow mixture to soak for 10 days, and then strain with gauze.","Take 15 to 20 drops mixed in a glass of water every day. You can also use it externally to treat rheumatism and hair loss. Just massage affected areas and wait for results."],"targetTitle":"Did You Know That This Plant From Your Garden Can Treat Hair Loss?","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAAAM1BMVEUAAAD\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/+3leKCAAAAEHRSTlMA9\/T9cvBY5MTFJi6EKQIePgkTlgAAAEtJREFUeNqNy0kOwDAIQ1GTsXO5\/2lbWUW1sspfwRNgppL8KxVC7PkVgrPlvG53gY2TALCagBlgChz2EY7xJQcwuaw\/VELrAb1hogdjoAYvvbHk\/QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/XTvjP\/7cdcb179be7fa4f4eeea1f87b2f6869b6518110f\/scr.png","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/XTvjP\/0d86768b4714027c971bfbfd563a68a4189c7a16.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAAAYFBMVEUAAAD\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/98JRy6AAAAH3RSTlMA8PwB\/iHFXDT14frmdqsbMqj46CkU2e6g+37e\/eseQ0l9HQAAAFtJREFUeNqVzUcKwDAMRFG5pffe5\/63DI6xsQNZZHb\/IRB9L2rDFjnGAGJA+Z2kyITXdQGU5K3Cs7nRwcCoM9APGgCQNDCRBW5gcbAa2F4XXDnYcUjgvMh++bMbX5wJSDyqfBcAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/XTvjP","id":304}

They can also search stations by artist, album or song to find stations that play similar music.","Google's free music service comes two years after it introduced its paid version, which gives users access to more than 30 million songs for $10 per month. By creating free online radio stations, the tech giant is hoping to better compete against Spotify and Pandora, which have gained huge followings with their free music streaming services, and convert some free Google listeners into paying customers.","Tuesday's premiere by Google coincides with recent tensions between streaming services and music artists. Over the weekend, Apple\u2019s upcoming paid streaming-music service faced withering criticism from pop singer Taylor Swift, who wrote a letter complaining about the company failing to pay artists royalties during a free three-month trial period.","Apple quickly caved in. But it served as a big reminder about the tensions between the music streaming services and musicians, many of whom are angry about what they describe as low royalty rates.","Google, with its new Internet radio, said it is paying the statutory rate to artists. As such, the company did not have to negotiate new deals with record labels. But Google is still vulnerable to some of the same challenges other streaming services over its payments to artists and record labels.","On Google Music, Swift's previous records are available for streaming using the paid service but her most recent album, 1989, is only for sale. The album is not available on paid streaming nor will it be available on the free version.","Spotify and Pandora\u2019s streaming services \u2014 both free and paid \u2014 have a big head start on Google. As competition heats up with Apple in the mix, Google will need a free service to pull in paid users. Google doesn\u2019t disclose subscriber numbers. But it did say that it has doubled the number of paid listeners in the last year.","In comparison, Spotify recently revealed that it has 75 million users, 25 million of whom are paid subscribers.","Google\u2019s free service will include two types of ads including a video pre-roll ad as well as banner ads. Marketers can buy ads as a part of the Google display and video networks.","Some of the nuts and bolts behind Google's free streaming comes from Google acquisition last year of Songza, a music streaming service that used humans to curate playlists. Songza's team will help program the new streaming stations, in contrast to Pandora and Spotify, which are automated.","Google says that with or without a subscription, users can continue store and play their own purchased music, which includes 50,000 songs, for free."],"targetTitle":"Google: Free music streaming service unveiled","targetDescription":"As competition with Apple, Spotify and Pandora heats up, Google has made another bet on music.","targetKeywords":"google, google music, pandora, apple, spotify, taylor swift","targetMedia":["https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/458045642.jpg?w=720","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","https:\/\/fortunedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/05\/458045642.jpg?w=1100&quality=85"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/for.tn\/1dZY6KM","id":306}

Although this doesn't quite make sense on first reading, you may be surprised to know that there really are foods that can help you do just that.","Research suggests that there are some foods that may help manage weight by boosting the metabolism, due to their thermogenic effect on the body - in other words, the amount of energy used and heat produced as your body processes this food.","All foods, when consumed, speed up the action of the muscles in the digestive tract, using up energy and producing heat in the process. This is known as thermogenesis.","However, certain foods use up more energy and create more heat as the body 'burns' calories. The harder the food is to digest, the more calories the body will have to burn to fully break it down, before it can absorb the nutrients from it.","Thermogenesis kicks in after every meal and the digestive process continue to burn calories many hours after a meal is eaten.","The thermogenic effect of food will depend upon the type of food and the amount of food consumed in the diet as a whole.","An effective weight loss programme can be modified to include some of these thermogenic foods to help you to achieve your goals, but it is important to remember that this effect will only be achieved as part of a balanced diet.","With this in mind, here are eight foods that can have a thermogenic effect on your body:","1. CHILI PEPPERS","Capsaicin, a compound in chilli peppers, stimulates the body to burn energy and create heat. In our bodies, white fat cells store energy and brown fat cells are thermogenic, producing heat by burning fat.","A 2015 study suggested that increasing capsaicin in the diet may stimulate thermogenesis and also induce white fat cells to behave like thermogenic brown fat cells.","Use fresh chilis, chilli flakes or cayenne powder to add flavour to marinades and dressings or simply sprinkle liberally on your meals.","2. WHOLE GRAINS AND VEGETABLES","Complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, oats and quinoa (also high in protein), are high in dietary fibre that the gut cannot fully digest and break down.","The extra effort the body has to put in requires extra energy, burning its energy stores to digest these indigestible foods.","It is no surprise that any weight loss programme will encourage eating high portions of vegetables, and in particular the leafy greens such as spinach, rocket, watercress, kale and cabbage.","These vegetables are all high in insoluble fibre. As with complex carbohydrates, these will have a thermic effect on the body as more energy is used up in an attempt to digest these indigestible compounds.","So, aim to reach your seven-a-day, of which five are vegetables and a maximum of two are fruits. Choose fruits with high fibre content, such as apples or pears.","3. BLACK PEPPER","Piperine, a compound found in black pepper, has a thermic effect and can be responsible for the breakdown of some fat cells.","So, reaching for the black pepper not only offers the benefits of its thermic effect but also adds extra flavour to your meal.","4. GINGER","Ginger also contains capsaicin, responsible for its fiery flavour. Eating ginger, fresh or powdered, in your food can speed up the metabolism due to the increased heat production.","Studies also suggest that ginger can reduce feelings of hunger and may help to manage weight. Use it in stir-fries, curries and marinades or try a warming ginger tea. Slice into thick discs and add hot water, and allow it to steep for 10 minutes.","Ginger can also be grated from frozen or stored in the freezer already sliced, ready to use in a tea.","5. GARLIC","Like ginger, garlic - with its fiery kick - contains compounds that can enhance thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. Use extra cloves if you enjoy the taste and include in marinades and dressings for a flavour boost.","6. MUSTARD","Mustard contains compounds found in other spicy foods, and in particular capsaicin, that not only gives it its characteristic flavour but also can also help to increase the body temperature when eaten.","Add in a teaspoon of mustard to your salad dressing or include it in a casserole for added flavour.","7. GREEN TEA","Studies show that both caffeine and catechin polyphenols - micronutrients - found in green tea can help to stimulate the metabolism, boosting the number of calories used by the body.","Therefore, it can promote weight loss, when combined with a healthy balanced diet and increased physical activity.","8. PROTEIN","When compared to fats and carbohydrates, eating a meal high in protein has a bigger thermic effect. Proteins are complex nutrients and will require more energy to break them down as part of the digestive process.","For example, if you eat a chicken breast containing 300 calories, around 30 percent (i.e. 100 calories) will be burned during digestion.","Research has shown that eating a high protein diet leads to lower weight gain, in part also due to its positive effect on post-meal hunger and desire to eat.","Always ensure good protein with every meal or snack, not only for its thermogenic effect but also to help you stay full. Vegetarian protein sources include quinoa, beans, brown rice and lentils."],"targetTitle":"Fat-burning foods already in your kitchen: From chili to mustard, how to turn 8 classic ingredients into bulge-beating superfoods","targetDescription":"Certain foods have an effect on the body known as thermogenesis, which uses up more energy to 'burn' calories, and thus more fat.

Namely, the fact that there isn't much when it comes to African-American males, a troubling fact for one of the state's most elite institutions.","A group of students, led by Sy Stokes, posted a video voicing their concerns about the number of black students on campus, and their message is hard to ignore. Stokes, a third-year Afro-American studies student who identifies as black, Cherokee and Chinese, recites a spoken word poem in the video, citing blaring statistics about the university's diversity issue.","According to the school's enrollment statistics, African-Americans make up 3.8 percent of the student population. In the video, Stokes points out that black males make up 3.3 percent of the male student population, and that 65 percent of those black males are undergraduate athletes. Of the incoming men in the freshmen class, only 1.9 percent of them were black.","In an interview with the Daily Bruin, Stokes said he almost dropped out of UCLA during his first year because he felt isolated and uncomfortable. Although he eventually found his niche in the minority community, he said he wanted to raise awareness about the school's lack of diversity before the university's application deadline on Nov. 30.","\"We had to do something to put our issues on the map,\" Stokes said.","In an email statement to the school paper, Janina Montero, vice chancellor of student affairs, said administrators acknowledge the need for more diversity and are attempting to work within the state's admission parameters.","\"We certainly recognize that the low numbers of African Americans and other underrepresented students on campus does lead to a sense of isolation and invisibility,\" Montero said in her email statement. \"It is difficult to eliminate this painful imbalance without considering race in the admissions process.\"","The state of California voted down affirmative action in 1996 and passed Proposition 209, which banned state schools from considering race, gender, ethnicity or national origins in their admissions processes. Black student enrollment has severely decreased since that provision and critics are saying that has to change.","The students' video adds to the ongoing affirmative action debate both inside and outside of the state, raising awareness about diversity at institutions around the country. Stokes said he feels responsible for spreading the word about the unknown challenges of being a minority student at UCLA and the ongoing lack of diversity on campus.","\"Being the cousin of Arthur Ashe, I feel as though it is my responsibility to uphold the strong voices of the Black Bruin community,\" he said.

{"postId":"52wcr5","postText":["If you leave your kids alone, it\u2019s not predatory strangers who are a risk"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Once, when she was in about the first grade, she even found a snake. \"There\u2019s no way I would have picked up a snake in front of my parents,\" she says. \"The reason I knew it was OK was I had also gone by myself to the library to take a snake safety class.\" (Yes, a snake safety class.)","\"You can pretend you\u2019re the Queen of Sheba,\" she says.","Playing on her own let her imagination soar.","As a child, Ashley Thomas loved to go, by herself, to a meadow about a 10-minute walk from her house in Ojai, California.","Ah, the old-time memories of the days when kids could play on their own without someone posting a video online to shame their parents, or calling the police to have mom arrested and the children seized by social services!","Only in the past decade or so has \"no child left alone\" become the social and legal norm in the U.S.","A doctoral student in cognitive science at the University of California at Irvine, Thomas is the lead author of a recently published study designed to understand what\u2019s going on.","After all, under most circumstances, the objective risk to children left by themselves is extremely low.","The chances that a stranger will abduct and kill or not return a child, the great fear driving the new norm, is about 0.00007 per cent or one in 1.4 million annually.","It\u2019s much more dangerous to drive a child somewhere, or even to walk with one across a parking lot, than to leave a kid alone in a well-ventilated car.","News reports and crime shows feed exaggerated fears.","Thomas and her co-authors note that legal norms needn\u2019t follow inaccurate beliefs about risks.","\"The fact that many people irrationally fear air travel does not result in air travel being criminalized,\" they write.","\"Parents are not arrested for bringing their children with them on airplanes.","\"In contrast, parents are arrested and prosecuted for allowing their children to wait in cars, play in parks, or walk through their neighbourhoods without an adult,\" they note.","Indeed, parents safely make decisions every day without thinking about other tiny risks.","\"When you decide to park your car in a parking lot you don\u2019t look up at the roof to see if a sniper could hit you,\" Thomas says.","You don\u2019t think about whether the store you\u2019re taking your child into might get held up.","Nor should you.","Yet leaving your kid alone, even for a short time in safe circumstances, can lead to a child-abuse investigation.","What\u2019s going on?","The researchers suspected that the overestimating of risk reflects moral convictions about proper parenting.","To separate the two instincts, they created a series of surveys asking participants to rate the danger to children left alone in five specific circumstances: a 2 1\u20442-year-old at home for 20 minutes eating a snack and watching Frozen , for instance, or a 6-year-old in a park about a mile from her house for 25 minutes. The reasons for the parent\u2019s absence were varied randomly. It could be unintentional, for work, to volunteer for charity, to relax or to meet an illicit lover.","Because the child\u2019s situation was exactly the same in all the intentional cases, the risks should also be identical.","Asked what the dangers might be, participants listed the same ones in all circumstances, with a stranger harming the child the most common, followed by an accident.","The unintentional case might be slightly more dangerous, because parents wouldn\u2019t have a chance to make provisions for their absence such as giving the child a phone and emergency instructions or parking the car in the shade.","But survey respondents didn\u2019t see things this way at all.","\"A mother\u2019s unintentional absence was seen as safer for the child than a mother\u2019s intentional absence for any reason, and a mother\u2019s work-related absence was seen as more dangerous than an unintentional absence, but less dangerous than if the mother left to pursue an illicit sexual affair,\" they write.","The same was true for fathers, except that respondents rated leaving for work as posing no greater danger than leaving unintentionally.","Moral disapproval informed beliefs about risks.","That was true even when the survey explicitly separated the two factors, first asking participants to rate leaving the child from 1 (nothing wrong) to 10 (highly unethical\/immoral).","People rated the risk higher when they first made a moral judgment.","\"People don\u2019t only think that leaving children alone is dangerous and therefore immoral,\" the researchers write.","\"They also think it is immoral and therefore dangerous.","\"That is, people overestimate the actual danger to children who are left alone by their parents, in order to better support or justify their moral condemnation of parents who do so.\"","The result is a feedback loop that increases the legal and social penalties for leaving kids alone and reinforces the belief that even the briefest parental absence amounts to child abuse.","These beliefs don\u2019t just affect busybodies.","They lead police, prosecutors, judges and jurors to overestimate risks.","Take what happened to Julie Koehler: she left her three daughters, ages 8, 5 and 4, watching a video in the minivan while she went into an Evanston, Illinois, Starbucks for three minutes. When she saw a police officer talking to the girls through the open windows, she thought nothing of it, until he returned and her 8-year-old started crying. She rushed out of the store, and the situation deteriorated from there.","Koehler is a public defender in the homicide division. She knew she hadn\u2019t broken any laws and she had two lawyers, her husband and mother, to call to the scene.","She wasn\u2019t arrested, but the state nonetheless initiated a child-abuse investigation.","Officials interrogated the kids, required a pediatrician\u2019s exam, demanded that Koehler supply two references, and questioned them and her about her mental health, including whether she was on any medications.","\"What if I was taking an anti-depressant? Would that have affected the outcome of the case?\" she asks.","The investigation determined that the report of abuse was \"unfounded.\"","But it taught Koehler the hazards of leaving your kids for even the briefest time under the safest circumstances.","The real stranger danger doesn\u2019t come from would-be kidnappers.","It comes from people who think they\u2019re doing good."],"targetTitle":"If you leave your kids alone, it\u2019s not predatory strangers who are a risk","targetDescription":"A California study found it\u2019s moralizing do-gooders who are most likely to make mischief.","targetKeywords":"raising children, child abuse, parenting","targetMedia":["https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE\/3bb573b34edd384b74aec163da118567d755c5d2.svg","https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE\/2b4fb6dd0c236e9bafb314f7f9053c1c57fedc62.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE\/948ec622c434ecd8a2e669ec8c554276bd611a94.jpg","https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE\/27e3cf3200c09fabeb1a087d8bd2d97566c4cde1\/scr.png","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAMAAAAoLQ9TAAABU1BMVEUAAAABAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALCwsfHx8dHR0ICAgCAgIVFRUSEhISEhIODg5TU1MFBQUCAgIDAwNJSUkTExMEBAQHBwcICAgEBAQMDAwCAgJZWVk5OTkKCgoUFBQhISEODg4KCgoAAAANDQ0MDAwCAgIBAQEjIyMCAgIvLy8AAAAVFRUPDw8ODg4QEBAAAAAKCgovLy8qKioKCgoTExMAAAASEhIODg4EBAQAAAAFBQUKCgoKCgoAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcXFwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQEBAAAAAeHh4AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACAgIoKCgkJCQNDQ12dnYSEhIdHR0lJSUmJiYwMDAUFBQZGRkKCgpiYmKCFFTcAAAAYnRSTlMAAAQCB+9A\/gFZYMtZCwADOK7fSgEA9k8APVM3pCfZpCenzKzqGgAAABHgJpHABxMZeE4k4epZw4I8eK5zAF1oSfMhmf7HKzGF1tO0RzIxna+4zTUDJecM4KyL0GEQw2Xe1BogW7kAAAC\/SURBVHheNY1Tg8RAEAY7yWZt2zbOtm2jszji\/3OnZy710l\/VSwOjGQbCYrPTkSRrMuWQ2Mp85ig4Xd7Rn3uRLZ+nRiHgr28EQ3IkGosnQGA+Sp9kB+\/f+YLwYqlcqfZ\/fjVsGHhotaHz8aYho0vem5icmh4iZ4bC7Fd\/bh4FCxSUpWVYEb66BvqfdXLT5ta2rKed3b39g0PVdKxwNZ6enV8AXCJe8c\/XN4i37Mp39w9APKqIT3wpIHh+eTXCP2MHbSZMouN0pwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE\/edb305a3314afd8868f9b9c5e93de7bff390d012.svg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="],"targetUrl":"https:\/\/archive.is\/BlcQE","id":311}

{"postId":"518456","postText":["Expect Hillary to do this almost immediately if she wins in November"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["July 1, 2016 | Nick Bernabe","(ANTIWAR) Thirteen years of wars in the Middle East, since the illegal and criminal invasion of Iraq by the United States and Britain in 2003, have killed way over a million people; destroyed Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Libya, and created millions of refugees. The terrorist attacks by Daesh (also known as ISIS or ISIL) in Europe, coupled with hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East have strengthened xenophobia, Islamophobia, and more generally, hatred of foreigners. Daesh itself is a byproduct of the invasion of Iraq that led to the emergence of al-Qaeda in Iraq, morphing into its present state as a result of the wars in Libya and Syria. Can things get any worse? Not only can they, we should expect new wars in the Middle East if Hillary Rodham Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate for president is elected next November. Even a glance at her record and the neoconservatives\u2019 enthusiasm for her presidency indicate how likely new wars in the Middle East will be.","Hillary Clinton is a hawk and warmonger. People often point to her vote in 2002 for going to war in Iraq and her enthusiasm for it. After all, it was during her husband\u2019s presidency that toppling the regime of Saddam Hussein became the official policy of the United States. But, her track record of starting and supporting wars, and siding with despots is much deeper than Iraq. She supported the coup in Honduras in 2009 and in Ukraine in 2014; was the leading advocate of the U.S. and NATO intervention in Libya that turned that economically advanced nation into a hub for all types of terrorist groups; laughed shamelessly at the news of Muammar Ghaddafi\u2019s murder; supported extra-judicial assassinations by drones; backed escalation of the war in Afghanistan ordered by President Obama, and has taken an extremely hawkish stance toward Russia. And as Secretary of State she supported massive sale of advanced US weapons to Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf area, all reactionary dictatorships, the same weapons that are being used to attack Yemen.","The only \"accomplishments\" that she is still lacking are starting a war with Iran and invading Syria. If she is elected president, she may get to add both to her \"impeccable\" track record of war, bloodshed and destruction and in the process spark World War III, if it has not already begun as a result of US policy toward the Middle East.","Clinton considers Syria and Iran closely linked. In fact, most objective experts and analysts do believe that the war in Syria has a lot to do with Iran, its strategic alliance with Syria, its use of Syrian territory to help the Lebanese Hezbollah, and more generally what the Sunni Arab regimes of the region consider as the \"Shiite crescent\" \u2013 the alliance between the Shiites in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Lebanon.","So, before the war began in Syria in 2011, she supported secret negotiations between Israel and Syria as a way of separating the latter from Iran. But, the negotiations failed, as they always do, due to Israel\u2019s intransigence. Thus, to her destroying Syria in order to topple Bashar al-Assad became the pathway for attacking Iran, which she views as necessary for Israel\u2019s sake, as the Clintons have deep connections to Israel and its lobby in the United States","Her advocacy of direct US intervention in Syria began carefully. One of her top aides, Ann-Marie Slaughter who was director of policy planning at the State Department from 2009-2011, published a piece in the New York Times in February 2012 advocating foreign military intervention in Syria. Clinton herself became a leading force in putting together the so-called \"friends of Syria\" group, consisting of several Western nations and the very Arab regimes that despise Iran and have played the most important role in keeping the war continuing in Syria, namely, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, and Jordan, as well as Turkey. The group is similar to the Contact Group on Libya, also known as \"friends of Libya,\" which consisted essentially of the same countries and was created to help the opposition forces in Libya in 2011, and we all know what that help led to.","But, Hillary Clinton has gone even further. In an interview with the CNN she claimed Syria and Iran (as well as Russia) helped creating the Daesh, saying, \"ISIS was primarily the result of the vacuum in Syria caused by Assad first and foremost. Aided and abetted by Iran and Russia.\"","Despite Clinton\u2019s skepticism about a nuclear agreement with Iran, P5+1 and Iran signed the historic nuclear agreement in July 2015 after Iran made many significant concessions. After the nuclear accord the hope was that rapprochement between Iran and the United States would slowly develop. At the same time, it became crystal clear to practically everyone, from the President and his Vice President Joe Biden, to even the editors of the New York Times that Saudi Arabia and its allies are the main sponsors of terrorism in the Middle East. They are also raping the poor nation of Yemen with US logistic and military support.","Yet, Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old worn out songs and espousing the same failed policies toward Iran: more sanctions, more military threats, and more diplomatic pressure. This is of course neither new nor surprising. Along with the neocons, the Clintons have always been Iran\u2019s number one enemy in the US political establishment.","The cliche\u0301 in the West is that it is Iran that does not want improved relations with the West. That is not true, at least not when Iranian reformists, moderates, and pragmatists have been in power. Three times over the past 20 years the Iranian reformists and moderates have tried to improve the relations between their nation and the United States, and in each case the Clintons have either prevented the rapprochement or, as it is happening now, try to scuttle it.","In May 1995 former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist then but allied firmly with the reformists now, made a gesture of reconciliation toward the US by awarding the American oil company Conoco a major contract to develop a large offshore oil field in the Persian Gulf, although a European oil company had actually won the bidding for the contract. But, instead of responding in kind, Bill Clinton imposed total trade embargo on Iran in 1996 as part of his absurd, and ultimately failed \"dual containment\" policy according to which both Iran and Iraq were supposed to be contained and put in a strategic box.","Then, in 1998 former reformist President proposed \"dialogue among civilizations\" as a cautious approach to open dialogue between the two nations. Not only had Khatami won the presidential elections in 1997 in a landslide, his allies would sweep the first nationwide elections for city councils in fall of 1998 and for the Majles[Iranian parliament] in February 2000. But, once again, instead of making a major gesture toward Iranian democrats by lifting the economic sanctions, or at least suspending them, Bill Clinton announced that Iran could export pistachio, carpet and caviar to the United States, as if that would impress any Iranian. The Clinton administration claimed that it was seriously seeking formal dialogue with Iran, but Khatami was not interested, unless major sanctions against Iran would first be lifted, which were not.","After Hillary Clinton was elected a Senator from New York in 2000, she supported every resolution by Congress imposing unilateral sanctions on Iran. All such sanctions are illegal because they have not been approved by the United Nations Security Council. As Secretary of State Mrs. Clinton took the lead in putting together a coalition of Western nations that imposed \"the toughest sanctions\" in history on Iran. The sanctions hurt the lives of tens of millions of ordinary Iranians. Now that she is running for President again, Clinton\u2019s campaign brags about her role in putting in place the sanctions, as she does in her memoir as Secretary of State, Hard Choices.","In an interview with ABC in 2008, when Mrs. Clinton was running for President, she was asked what she would do if Iran attacked Israel with nuclear weapons, to which she responded, \"I want the Iranians to know that if I\u2019m the president, we will attack Iran. In the next 10 years, during which they might foolishly consider launching an attack on Israel we would be able to totally obliterate them\" (emphasis mine). Iran did not and does not have nuclear weapons and Clinton knew it, but she did not even declare that if Iran attacked Israel, which is highly unlikely if not impossible (unless Israel attacks first), she would defend Israel. Her threat to obliterate Iran, a very large country, can be accomplished by only one means: Attacking Iran with nuclear weapons.","Even though Clinton\u2019s most important \"accomplishment\" as Secretary of State, namely, attacking Libya under the guise of \"humanitarian intervention,\" which was nothing but naked military aggression, has been a total catastrophe, in interviews with the BBC and Voice of America in October 2011 she claimed that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. While the leaders of Iran\u2019s Green Movement, a democratic and peaceful movement that emerged after Iran\u2019s fraudulent presidential elections of June 2009, rejected any US help, Clinton said in the interviews that if they had asked for help, the US was prepared to help them the way it helped Libyan rebels. In other words, the US would have tried regime change in Iran.","Although Hillary Clinton claims that she supports the nuclear accord with Iran, she never misses a chance to demonize and belittles Iran. In a speech at the Brookings Institution last September, Clinton declared, \"I don\u2019t see Iran as our partner in implementing this agreement. I believe Iran is the subject of the agreement\" (emphasis mine), as if Iran is a banana republic that is subject to US will. In an article in TheJewish Journal she threatened Iran again,","\"We have to send Iran an unequivocal message. There can be no doubt in Tehran that if Iran\u2019s leaders violate their commitments not to seek, develop, or acquire any nuclear weapons, the United States will stop them. They will test our resolve with actions like their provocative ballistic missile test, for which we should impose new sanctions designations. They need to understand that America will act decisively if Iran violates the nuclear agreement, including taking military action if necessary.\" (emphasis added).","Clinton\u2019s rhetoric regarding Iran, even after the nuclear accord, only creates trouble for the administration of President Hassan Rouhani in the midst of his fierce power struggle with Tehran\u2019s hardliners. By taking a hardline toward the nuclear agreement and improved relations with Iran, Hillary Clinton is a strong ally of Iranian hardliners who also do not want any rapprochement with the United States.","In addition to constantly demonizing Iran, Hillary Clinton is always looking for ways of imposing new economic sanctions on Iran to carry favor with the pro-Israel lobby and its rich donors. For example, it is well known that Iranian hardliners were, and still are opposed to the nuclear agreement with P5+1, just as the neocons and the extreme right in the United States opposed it and still do. So, the Iranian hardliners have tried to demonstrate their unhappiness with the nuclear accord, and one way of doing so, in addition to creating other problems for the Rouhani administration, has been testing ballistic missiles. The missiles are purely defensive weapons meant to deter Israel and the tests, unlike what the opposition to the nuclear accord in the United States claims, do not violate UN Security Council Resolution 2231 that was issued after the nuclear accord to endorse it. Despite these glaring facts, after the missile tests, Mrs. Clinton quickly called for new sanctions against Iran.","During the primary season the Clinton campaign slammed Senator Sanders\u2019 suggestion that the US and Iran should have closer relations. Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton\u2019s senior policy adviser, said on January 21, \"This proposal [by Sanders] to more aggressively normalize relations and to move to warm relations with Iran not only breaks with President Obama\u2019s policy, it breaks with the sober and responsible diplomatic approach that\u2019s been working for the United States.\" This is not surprising. Hardliners everywhere are allies of each other and feed one another, and Clinton and Tehran\u2019s hardliners are no exception.","Not only does Hillary Clinton not want improved relations with Iran, she has been itching to find an excuse start a war with that nation and, thus, she constantly demonizes Iran. But, in addition to demonizing Iran, she also lies about that nation brazenly. For example, similar to Benjamin Netanyahu she always refers collectively to Iran, Daesh and the Palestinian group Hamas, as if they are allies. Iran has been fighting Daesh in both Syria and Iraq. Iran cut off its financial aid to Hamas after that organization refused to back Bashar al-Assad in Syria. There is absolutely no relation between Hamas and Daesh. In fact, many senior Israeli officers have made it clear that they prefer Hamas to run Gaza, because the alternative would be either Daesh or one of the terrorist groups allied with it,","Why is Mrs. Clinton so anti-Iran? I can think of at least two reasons. One is that Hillary Clinton has never given up her imperial ambitions to reshape the Middle East, because she believes in American \"exceptionalism\" and always speaks about \"American global leadership,\" which only means world dominance. She sees Iran as an impediment to her ambitions for the Middle East. Why does she want to reshape the Middle East and possibly change the borders? This brings us to the second reason for her being anti-Iran. Clinton is an Israel \"firster.\" Anything that she wants for the Middle East is intended for making the region as \"safe\" for Israel as possible. Clinton is not bothered by the fact that Israel is run by the far right with expansionist ambitions. To see this, all one has to do is listening to her speech at the annual meeting of AIPAC in March.","When asked during her first Democratic presidential debate last October \"which enemy are you most proud of,\" Hillary Clinton included \"the Iranians\" among them.

Why did she not make it clear that she meant, for example, Tehran\u2019s hardliners?

He\u2019s the CEO and founder of SunShare, a company that installs community gardens of solar panels so even those unable to have a solar panel on their roof can access solar power. One word to describe how he sees the energy industry of the future is \"choice.\"","\"What we\u2019re starting to see is this shift toward consumer preferences actually being an important factor in this industry for the first time,\" says David. \"It\u2019s as simple as the product we\u2019re bringing to customers, which is giving people the power to choose where they want to get their energy.\"","SunShare started in Colorado with a two-acre project, and has now spread to Minnesota and New York. The gardens range in size from one megawatt to five megawatts, and cover between six and 30 acres of land. Local utility companies purchase energy from the solar garden, and then community members subscribe to the solar garden and receive solar credits on their utility bill.","\"We think we can change the energy industry because demand for a type of power has never really driven the electricity industry in this country. What you had was more supply side determinations based on regulatory processes and monopoly utilities,\" says David. \"Our hypothesis and what we\u2019ve proven is that people will change, and people making choices with their pocketbooks drives change. Solar energy is beating the costs of natural gas plants across the country right now, even the operating costs, and that\u2019s not even including the volatility premium you\u2019d have to price in to a natural gas plant you\u2019d be building for 20 years. You\u2019ve got the economic plus the environmental benefits that really make solar a win-win for both utilities and consumers.\"","Yet change is not always easy, and David has had to work against systems that have been in place for a century as he pioneers a new way of providing power.","\"The challenges are working with utilities that aren\u2019t really built for this new operating system that comes with the renewable and distributed energy infrastructure, so having solar and wind farms around the country near the source of where people are consuming energy. That\u2019s not how this country has looked at consuming energy previously. You\u2019re basically going from one of those old DOS operating systems to Windows XP. It\u2019s a completely different experience,\" he says. \"That\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about in terms of the difference in how energy is transferred across the grid, managed across the grid, consumed across the grid, and tracked across the grid. It\u2019s that much of a difference. So you\u2019re working with this industry that\u2019s built on a DOS platform with DOS economics. Changing that mindset is probably one of the biggest challenges, but economics are driving that; it\u2019s a powerful force.\"","As he pursues making solar power affordable and available, he\u2019s at a unique vantage point to predict how the energy industry will ultimately change. In addition to the choices available to people, David predicts it will be easier for utility companies to monitor their energy output.","\"I think you\u2019re going to be able to track energy usage so that you can much more closely match energy production to energy demand. Previously power plants might be operating consistently 24 hours a day because they really can\u2019t be shut off. You can\u2019t just turn off a coal-fired power plant for four hours in a day. You end up burning a lot more energy, a lot more coal, for example, at nighttime than is actually being used on the system,\" he says. \"So you\u2019ll see a lot less waste in the system, which overall will significantly reduce our energy consumption as a country.\"","Energy of the future will also be more reliable and secure. \"It\u2019s going to be terrorist-proof: you\u2019re not going to have single points of weakness on the system where terrorists can disrupt our access to electricity. By that, I mean localized, renewable energy creates backup support systems on the grid that don\u2019t fail with natural disasters or terrorism,\" says David."],"targetTitle":"What Will Make The Future Of Energy Terrorist-Proof?","targetDescription":null,"targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/methane-burn-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/UNEMPLOYED-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Terrorist.jpg","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-424x282.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/1339818-oil-anniversary-slide-07-1-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/09\/6089_grande-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/UNEMPLOYED-424x282.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/exxonnmobil-02-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/01\/TheSurge_small.png?x15124","http:\/\/2.gravatar.com\/avatar\/591fb988757c3c376698a78b35d9193d?s=75&d=http%3A%2F%2Fthesurge.com%2Fapp%2Fthemes%2Fabsolute%2Fimages%2Favatar.png&r=g","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/02\/SunShare_AUG_4_2015-35-1024x683.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/08\/WestTexasUpdate-Option2-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/02\/exxonnmobil-02-424x282.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/02\/sunshare-portraits-2773-788x1024.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/01\/SquareLogo-White473x200-1.png?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2017\/01\/Daily-Surge-2-1-180x122.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/02\/Terrorist-200x200.jpg?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/12\/bpships-180x122.png?x15124","http:\/\/thesurge.com\/app\/uploads\/2016\/12\/bpships-424x282.png?x15124"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/thesurge.com\/stories\/what-will-make-the-future-of-energy-terrorist-proof","id":325}

It's possible, but rare.","Can a woman get pregnant when she is already pregnant? In other words, can she have two foetuses in her uterus at different stages of development?","The technical term for this is superfetation. In humans, it's possible, but it's very uncommon.","Two thousand years ago, that great Greek thinker Aristotle wondered about this very topic, specifically as regards the hare.","Aristotle noticed that when a hare gave birth, quite often the offspring in a single litter would fall into two distinct classes: there would be a bunch of full-sized robust baby hares, and another bunch of scrawny frail baby hares.","It was, he thought, as though the mother hare had become pregnant and then \u2014 while pregnant \u2014 had conceived a second time.","There was nothing fundamentally wrong with the smaller, weedy offspring, Aristotle thought, apart from the fact that they had not spent enough time growing in their mother's uterus. And he was right.","Normally in humans, there are three separate barriers to stop a female from getting pregnant again if she is already pregnant.","The first barrier is the hormonal changes after conception that stop the ovaries from releasing another egg.","Dr Karl explores the uncommon phenomenon of superfetation.","The second barrier is physical: a mucous plug. Almost immediately after conception, a plug forms in the cervix and sits at the top of the vagina. This plug stops any other sperm from entering the uterus and getting to a second egg.","Third, there are physical and chemical changes that happen to the inner lining of the uterus in pregnancy. These changes usually stop a second fertilised egg from being able to attach to the uterine wall.","Even so, some animal species manage to get around all these barriers. About 1 to 2 per cent of all pregnant cows show signs of being potentially fertile while they are already pregnant, and superfetation has been observed in animals such as the mouse, the rabbit, the sheep, the buffalo, the mink, and the Australian swamp wallaby.","Superfetation is extremely uncommon in humans, with fewer than a dozen cases in the medical literature.","A typical case is that of Julia Grovenburg, a 31-year-old woman from Arkansas.","Ms Grovenburg and her partner had been trying to get pregnant for three years, and had begun to consider adoption of a child.","But amazingly she conceived twice in 2009 \u2014 a few weeks apart. The Daily Mail claimed that, in a \"desperate and final attempt to have children of their own\", the couple had given it one last try.","This is a curious use of the word desperate.","Possible superfetation has been observed in cows","I might be old-fashioned, but it seems odd to me to regard sexual intercourse as \"a desperate and final attempt\" to get pregnant.","It makes you wonder what measures they tried before they got desperate.","Anyhow, Ms Grovenburg was pregnant \u2014 but then things went odd: the ultrasound showed two independent babies, each living in their own separate amniotic sac. But one was much larger and more developed than the other.","As the ultrasounds scans mounted up for Ms Grovenburg, both foetuses seemed to be growing normally and healthily, though it appeared as if one foetus had simply started a few weeks after the other.","In other words, Mrs Grovenburg had conceived a second baby a few weeks after becoming pregnant with the first.","Now we don't have rock-solid proof that this is what happened. We would need a series of ultrasound scans to prove that.","These scans would need to document a series of changes \u2014 starting with no foetus or amniotic sac in the uterus, and then a single foetus in its single amniotic sac, and a second foetus appearing in their own second amniotic sac after a few weeks.","People don't usually get a series of ultrasound scans immediately after sexual intercourse, so this kind of hard data is difficult to get.","But there is some evolutionary biology behind superfetation. Female European brown hares frequently have a second pregnancy while already pregnant. This means females can have about one third more offspring in each breeding season.","For humans, more babies each breeding cycle isn't always a plus \u2014 especially if you're trying to get a good night's sleep.","If you have inside knowledge of a topic in the news, contact the ABC.","It's a phenomenon known as superfetation, and while it's rare, it can happen."],"targetTitle":"Dr Karl: Can you get pregnant during a pregnancy?

{"postId":"724670344515182594","postText":["How should publishers and news organizations utilize the text messaging medium?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Facebook Messenger weaves chatbots with friends","\"Facebook is a bit like that big dog galloping toward you in the park,\" said the late New York Times journalist David Carr, bemoaning the influence the social media giant has had on publishers\u2019 distribution\u2014and, in turn, monetization. \"More often than not, it\u2019s hard to tell whether he wants to play with you or eat you.\"","Now, Facebook has an even bigger, faster-encroaching dog for publishers to grapple with: messaging.","BBC uses Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play","Facebook\u2019s Messenger and WhatsApp products now process a combined 60 billion messages a day worldwide. As an emerging medium, messaging is bigger than even Facebook. It\u2019s the most widely used smartphone feature in the U.S., and it\u2019s already taking a bite out of social media. As of the beginning of this year, according to Business Insider\u2019s Intelligence Reports, the top four messaging apps\u2014WeChat, Viber, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp\u2014have already eclipsed the top four social networking apps\u2014Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram\u2014in their aggregate monthly active users.","This rapid growth is also poised to leave the rest of the mobile app ecosystem in the dust. According to eMarketer, more than 1.4 billion consumers were using messaging apps by the end of 2015; that\u2019s 75% of all smartphone users and an increase of 31.6% over the previous year. And that number has grown rapidly since. As of this week, Facebook Messenger has already amassed 900 million users on its own. At a time when most smartphone users download zero apps per month and a quarter of all downloaded apps are abandoned after a single use, users are spending an average of 200 minutes a week on WhatsApp.","So, this is clearly a medium we should pay attention to. But how should publishers and news organizations play with it? To answer that question, we need to grasp what it is about messaging that\u2019s allowed it to become pervasive, so that we can gain a better understanding of how content could fit comfortably on it.","Why Messaging Is Different","Text messages\u2014the ubiquitous kind that are primarily used by consumers on their mobile devices\u2014more aptly mimic the fluidity of human communication than other digital forms. The technology embedded in text messages sits in the background versus in your way. For instance, you can respond to a text message immediately or whenever is most convenient for you. It doesn\u2019t require conversing parties to be available simultaneously, as a phone call or video chat does, nor does it assume that people would rather correspond asynchronously, as with email.","Text messages also offer a better representation of a person\u2019s relationships by focusing on long-term conversations. Messages are typically organized in a list form that is automatically updated every time you interact with it. The people you talk to most frequently and recently at any given moment surface at the top of that list. You don\u2019t have to manually program and repeatedly update the list in the way you may have back when you added your friends and family members to phone-based speed dial, or in the way you need to tell Facebook which friends are closer to you than others, a status that can change from time to time.","Also, in the context of the text message thread, a message you receive carries the expectation that you will engage with it. In this fundamental way, messaging differs from push notifications or alerts, which instead serve to simply broadcast information. The expectation with an alert is that as soon as you interact with it, it goes away. As soon as you interact with a text message, it sits at the top of your messaging list.","This focus on fluidity and conversation allows text messaging to more adequately fit the demands of our dynamic circumstances and relationships than other forms of digital communication. To successfully engage with the medium, therefore, publishers should harness these unique features that have made messaging powerful.","Cost Center or Revenue Stream?","Publishers will also need to know if messaging offers a clear path\u2014or at least a dimly lit one\u2014to monetization in order to see how widely they can experiment and whether this new outlet will represent a new cost center or revenue stream. While it\u2019s too early to tell, there are a few unique related aspects that are potentially promising.","By virtue of it living on your phone messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data.","By virtue of it living on your phone, natively harnessing an ongoing memory of your conversations and serving as the best digital representation of your relationships, messaging is a natural access point to both your social and mobile data. For instance, Facebook Messenger is aware of your identity, social graph, location, conversation history and more. This ongoing memory\u2014coupled with the fact that users are already becoming increasingly comfortable with making payments on their mobile devices\u2014positions in-messaging payment services as potential facilitators of paywalled content. Once they set up their relationship with a service like Stripe or Facebook Messenger\u2019s native payments feature, users can theoretically convert to paying subscribers with a quick text versus detailing their personal and financial information at every point of sale. This could make payments via messaging more effortless than they are to facilitate via websites.","This unique access to data also allows for messaging to support personalized and perhaps more appropriate user interactions with sponsors. As opposed to simply serving banner ads that may feel disruptive to the conversational experience, messaging apps have the potential to serve offers based on a user\u2019s preferences. In this vein, Facebook Messenger revealed that it will be experimenting with sponsored messages.","Since preserving a personal tone is essential to the messaging experience, publishers and advertisers will likely explore this area cautiously, so we will hopefully see more intuitive exercises in commercialization using this new medium. For instance, since Facebook Messenger may already know of some services and companies you \"like\" via the data you have fed the parent platform over time, it will probably prioritize facilitating messages between you and those companies you already trust and may want to hear from. On the flip side, if an advertiser gets too noisy or feels irrelevant, you can easily block them from messaging you again.","Editorial Experiments","Before monetizing it, publishers need to test the medium itself. The most obvious, lowest-friction way to experiment within messaging platforms is to simply focus on them as new distribution points for content that\u2019s already been created. Predictably, many big publishers have dipped their toes in this way; for instance, The Economist and Buzzfeed both experimented with the messaging app Line to push out news alerts that include links back to their respective publications for the full stories. Setting up this type of experience is similar to using Twitter to alert users; simply create an account on a text messaging app, allow users to subscribe to that account and either manually send out notifications or set up automated news alerts.","While easy and cheap to fulfill, this use case renders an experience that\u2019s closer to that of a billboard than a conversation, which is why The Economist deemed the exercise a \"brand building initiative.\" Since the user can\u2019t really interact with the message, at best this experiment\u2019s results will be commensurate with the effort, and at worst, they may mirror punishment by way of a slow release of the entire works of Shakespeare over text.","In taking a step towards experimenting with the conversational aspect of messaging, some publishers have run efforts like live editorial commentary. In this paradigm, a publication\u2019s staff members chat amongst themselves\u2014for instance, discussing a news event\u2014and the subscribed audience can follow the conversation as it unfolds and maybe even participate in the discussion.","The Guardian hosted a WhatsApp chat alongside the GOP debates in December, and The Huffington Post ran a similar effort around various news topics on Viber. Another related use case involving editorial conversation is acting out a script. The BBC recently used Viber to tell the story of a real kidnapping in Mexico by having its editorial staff role play using actual quotes from people involved in the case.","As in the news alert use case, for this type of experience publishers need to create accounts on messaging platforms and build their subscriber bases. But this experiment also calls for extra time commitments from editorial staffers to write scripts and\/or run the live chats. It can also require an outside trigger event, like a debate, to be happening concurrently on another screen that chat subscribers are also tuning in to.","Chatbots","While potentially engaging, hosting live conversations on messaging apps is resource-intensive and limited in its interaction with end users, as editors can\u2019t scale themselves to respond to every user\u2019s question or comment. This problem has prompted publishers to experiment with chatbots to allow users to interact with the news.","In the context of text messaging, a bot is an account operated by software in place of a person. Given a pre-prescribed set of rules a human editor makes, a bot can theoretically respond to a user in a way that mimics a human response. Quartz recently released a news app that sends a user a blurb about a story and employs a bot to ask the user to select between reading more about that specific story or moving on to the next story.","Forbesbot on Telegram","CNN created a similar bot on Facebook Messenger using the just-released Send and Receive API, and publications like Forbes and TechCrunch have created bots on the messaging platform Telegram using bot creator Chatfuel. Purple is yet another similarly powered bot that texts users with election news, allowing them to delve deeper into a subtopic within a message by texting back a pre-designated keyword (e.g., \"Kasich\") contained within that original bot message. Powering these experiences relies on a diligent, combined effort of developing a bot (frequently via a third party) and dedicating editorial resources to writing short, conversational prose out of published stories.","In its current state, the news bot is a novelty that more closely mimics the experience of interacting with an automatic phone teller than talking to a human journalist. The seemingly endless loop of repeatedly hitting buttons or expressing keywords in order to get a response to a specific question can leave a user quickly fatigued. The underlying problem is that bots are essentially formulas created to handle a limited set of scenarios within a pre-defined framework, and they haven\u2019t gotten to the point where they can manage massive banks of scenarios smoothly enough to handle every-day decisions.","This problem isn\u2019t so different from why, with self-driving vehicles, \"We\u2019re clearly pretty close to making a car that can handle highway driving with no human input, since the range of possible events is pretty small,\" says Benedict Evans, a partner at the venture capital fund Andreesen Horowitz. \"But driving in central Rome or Moscow is an entirely different matter that needs an entirely different level of decision-making: What does that hand gesture mean?\"","To handle the multitude of scenarios presented in an open-ended system like chat, we need a far more sophisticated bot that can scalably and quickly run decisions based on all potential user inputs, a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that can more holistically mimic human conversations.","The current limitations of chatbots haven\u2019t stopped messaging platforms like Telegram, Kik and Facebook Messenger from launching their own bot ecosystems, nor have they hindered publications like The Washington Post from creating their own homegrown bots. The promise of true AI\u2014an interaction framework that would allow news providers to offer each of their users a bespoke conversational experience at scale\u2014is far too meaningful to give up on. That\u2019s why, in tandem with releasing its limited-scope Send and Recieve API for bot creators, Facebook has also released Bot Engine, a system based on machine learning that can pave the way for more complex scenarios, like handling different variations of the same user questions.","AI-powered News","Looking to the future, you can imagine an AI-based chatbot that truly comprehends intention behind language, a bot that you can have long-term discussions with about the news the way you would with a well-informed friend. This intelligent bot could also fulfill the promise of voice-based products like Apple\u2019s Siri or Amazon\u2019s Alexa. It would both learn who you are and understand the content within stories enough to surface news you\u2019d likely be interested in, whether or not you explicitly told it you were\u2014or perhaps before you even knew you were. This type of bot would be promising in the sense that it may change the current rut we are in with digital news, a relationship which Twitter\u2019s co-founder and Medium founder Ev Williams aptly describes as \"stuck in ... the idea that [the media people consume] is what they want.\"","Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?","While we don\u2019t currently have AI-powered news, we can start paving the way for it by crafting the right type of conversation-based frameworks for it. What\u2019s exciting about this for writers and journalists is that the archetype text messaging is based on\u2014broadly described as conversational user interface (UI)\u2014is largely driven by exposing functionality through language; \u2018designing\u2019 a killer chatbot, therefore, relies at least as much on using the right kind of language as it does on a creating a great graphical user interface. Will writers soon share the kind of power and influence over creating digital user experiences that graphical designers now have?","Unlike websites and mobile apps, which rely heavily on navigational design and buttons to express breadth of coverage and direct users to the content they may be interested in, with chatbots \"all of your features need to be reachable solely through words\u2014so picking the right thing to say, and the tone of your dialogue with the user, is crucial,\" explains Matty Mariansky, who created MeeKan, a calendaring bot for enterprise messaging platform Slack. This new role of language can empower writers to design experiences for messaging-based services. For instance, Mariansky hired dedicated scriptwriters to come up with more than 2,000 sentences to handle a meeting request.","While Mark Zuckerberg argues that the best messaging experiences will combine conversational and graphical UI rather than rely on words alone, the role of language as a form of user experience design becomes even more important when we start designing our bots to be flexible enough to work with both text and voice. When the bot is stripped of a screen altogether, as with services like Siri and Alexa, language is the user experience.","It wouldn\u2019t be far-fetched, therefore, to imagine a scenario in which journalists extend their writing skills and editorial judgment to not only cover stories, but design the channels through which these stories are distributed. These writers may also be critical to the development of an entirely new bot-influenced lexicon, introducing new words and phrases into our vernacular and, through them, new ways for users to interact with the news.","This type of shift\u2014the ability for writers and publishers to design digital experiences with the same skill set used to hone their journalistic craft\u2014could profoundly change their current shaky relationship with digital products and news distribution and, in turn, with their monetization streams and readers. Journalists don\u2019t have to sit back and watch this bot story unfold. There are no definitive paradigms yet, so we can help write the book on creating the most engaging experiences."],"targetTitle":"The Medium is The (Text) Message","targetDescription":"Covering thought leadership in journalism","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/niemanreports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/facebook-chatbot-1200x0-c-default.png","http:\/\/niemanreports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Baratz1-50x50-c-default.jpg","http:\/\/niemanreports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/facebook-chatbot.png","http:\/\/hvrd.me\/wp-content\/themes\/nieman\/img\/logos\/reports-logo-color.svg","http:\/\/hvrd.me\/wp-content\/themes\/nieman\/img\/logos\/harvard_shield.svg","http:\/\/niemanreports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/Forbes-bot-on-Telegram.jpg.jpeg","http:\/\/niemanreports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/04\/BBC-on-Viber.jpg.jpeg","http:\/\/hvrd.me\/wp-content\/themes\/nieman\/img\/logos\/foundation-logo-color.svg"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/hvrd.me\/4n4FYd","id":328}

{"postId":"554ep7","postText":["Here's How Much You're Going To Spend On The Holidays This Year"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["It may feel like it\u2019s too early to even talk about holiday shopping, but in reality, two out of five millennial shoppers have already started buying presents for the holiday season. Some consumers were crossing things off the list before back-to-school shopping even wrapped up.","Erin Dunphy, 25, started her holiday shopping this summer. She says it\u2019s better for her wallet, and starting early better accommodates her work schedule.","\"It really helps to spread out the spending that I want to do and really start to look at the things or experiences I want to give to others,\" says Erin. \"Also, August through February is my busiest time at work. So I make sure I try to cross things off my list early in the process.\"","Erin also uses shopping early as a way to stick to a budget. She puts away money for the holidays well in advance, which guarantees she isn\u2019t draining her bank account as the holidays approach. It also spaces out her spending, and ensures she\u2019s not paying sizeable holiday markups on her purchases.","\"I start saving early so I have a little stash that I know is for others. Buying now means if something goes wrong, I can pay for it all and not feel like I have to choose between [buying] presents or fixing my car if it were to break,\" she says.","While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Rubicon Project While we may cringe at the fact that holiday decorations go up as soon as the fake Halloween cobwebs get taken down, buying early does seem to be a budgeting tactic that a lot of millennials favor. According to the Holiday Consumer Pulse survey , millennials are one of the primary groups controlling holiday spending this year. The Rubicon survey reports that millennials are predicted to spend an average of $1,427 in 2016, up from the $1,072 they spent last year. This is based off 1,003 interviews Rubicon conducted in late August 2016.","Erin says she can see herself spending close to the millennial average by the time she\u2019s completed her shopping. She shops for her immediate family, her fiance\u0301, her fiance\u0301\u2019s parents and her two best friends.","\"For the parents, nana and brother, my fiance\u0301 and I usually split the cost which helps tremendously. Right now I have all the friend presents, my mom\u2019s present and I know what I\u2019m getting for everyone,\" says Erin. \"My fiance\u0301 and I are going to Hawaii on our honeymoon, so we\u2019re getting each other an experience while we\u2019re there, that\u2019s the only one I\u2019m really waiting on.\"","Millennials aren\u2019t the only ones controlling holiday shopping this year. Their spending still comes second to parents (though these two categories overlap). Parents plan to spend an average of more than $1,700 this holiday season. Not only is this about $300 more than they spent in 2015 (the average was $1,383 last year), but it\u2019s also substantially more than the $903 non-parents plan to spend.","Parents are predicted to spend $495 per child this year, which is nearly $100 more than they spent last year. However, there is a discrepancy between how much each parent spends. Male parents plan to spend slightly more per child. The survey results for millennials and parents also revealed that more than half plan to buy a gift for themselves. (The men planning on buying gifts for themselves say they\u2019d spend approximately $400, compared to the average of $242 women say they\u2019ll spend on themselves.)","As for where the money is going, millennials are by far the most digitally enabled shoppers, which means it will be another big holiday season for online retailers.","\"Most of [my shopping] will be online,\" says Erin. \"It\u2019s just easier that way. I can compare prices a little easier than in the stores, and I use cash back extensions on my browser which helps get some money back.\"","Walmart and Amazon are still predicted to be in the top retail spots for 2016 holiday shopping, but millennials heavily favor Amazon. And l ike Erin, 84% of shoppers research their gift selections online before committing.","Overall, the average holiday shopper will spend $1,175 this year, up from last year\u2019s average of $1,051. Of those surveyed, 44% plan to spend more this year than they did in 2015.","In addition, Cyber Monday sales might rival Black Friday sales this year. Of those surveyed, 42% will shop on Black Friday, but 47% will capitalize on Cyber Monday deals. Based on the behaviors of millennial and parent shoppers, it\u2019s not surprising that Cyber Monday will be so big; 58% of millennials say they are more compelled by online advertising than television advertising, while 38% of parents make purchases online directly from their mobile device.","We\u2019re not even into October yet, so there\u2019s still plenty of time to start saving for your projected holiday expenses. And the sooner you start, the more you\u2019ll be able to budget little by little, instead of incurring one huge financial hit in December. Even if you\u2019re opposed to buying in October, you can start by browsing for sales, checking when prices on different items might drop, comparing reviews to find the right gifts, and of course, putting away whatever you can spare so you have a healthy holiday shopping stash."],"targetTitle":"Here's How Much You're Going To Spend On The Holidays This Year","targetDescription":"You've been warned well in advance, so there's still time to start saving.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/22b9cefe3fe89cc7c8240db655dedc8dfe41b6dc","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/fdad158358424e2ff6c46ef6c71bbb5801eb5eaa.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/995e2e660709ca5e6fd624d660dc5193bdd9cb73.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/eb043108ca91c5a4536fd5a68150d2fdc7f2663d","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/68cbf1693b6ec53fa1193fd698280e68284f61aa\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/f6a84fa458ddad87af110efc46ae89506a781b10","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/3b1a47128943a59019f7d578a291e494abfc0357","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/b81644b1d6a60bc974c1ac619a46b86d2fe2b7c6","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/aec4b70785df3507611485a163ef051c3339867f.gif","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/c60b43ab58afbdb4c63f1437eceec725e294c7f7","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/442104bfe49e442ecd0a2f5000f8cce1f92c66ee","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/67d1302b74917d5089d787969071a99e5c5c9677","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAgACAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAACAAIAAAIChFEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/cf1d186cfd227b6a8536c557e37a0a67942e9537","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/1eb3f483ae870ea426764717893161adde2d9220","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/997ac42cb03c6d2fde908e7d38f2ce919a3f000a.svg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf\/7ac0cdeeca1ec3d6195cef994c56793b01a6548e"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/WnJQf","id":330}
{"postId":"4jhjtg","postText":["10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons They Lost Their Value"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Few myths are more common than the idea of collecting as an investment. Unfortunately for these ten examples, the bust has come.","At one point or another most of us have daydreamed about finding buried treasure up in the attic. Whether it's an old china set, some dusty candlesticks or a copy of the Declaration of Independence, there's always that hope that maybe up among the rubbish is something of real value just waiting to be discovered.","After all, what could be better than a climate controlled treasure hunt?","That dream extends into collectibles. From pogs to marbles to Cabbage Patch Kids, most of us tried to collect something at one point or another. For a fewm the passion kept going, until today a few folks have the kind of pop-culture artifacts that will amaze archeologists from future civilizations.","For the time being, you can probably leave those shoeboxes where they lie though, because the truth is that those old prizes rarely retain much value over time. No matter how high profile, most collections sooner or later become little more than old curiosities, remnants of a fad that only really made sense in a specific time and a particular place.","Yet perception often lags. When it comes to many collections, people's belief in their value as an investment lingers long after that ceases to be true. What drives the kind of passion that can send prices for laminated cardstock soaring, and what can bring that tumbling back down to Earth? To understand that, it's helpful to look at ten collections that are worth less, sometimes a lot less, than many people think.","10. Coca-Cola Memorabilia","As Jim Griffith, an antiquarian and the dean of education for eBay, explained, a few rules guide the price of collectibles. First and foremost is the oldest of all: supply and demand.","\"It would be a mistake,\" he said, \"not to ascribe to the collectibles market the general rule of market value historically.\"","That particular rule hit the market for Coca-Cola collectibles hard.","Back in the 1940s and 1950s, America seemingly couldn't get enough of Coke brand merchandise, and the company obliged, pumping out paraphernalia from clocks and coolers to more exotic fare, such as the iconic gas station pumps and even flatware sets. (Contrary to popular rumor, however, the Smith & Wesson Coke bottle grip was simply named after the shape, not a marketing partnership.) Prices soared for even the most mundane of items as collectors and novices alike grabbed every red and white TV tray they could.","This also brought prices tumbling back down when those \"collectibles\" were on the shelves of every single dime store in the country. Today, the more elaborate pieces will still fetch a good price, such as the vending machines listed for over $1,000, but most of those Coke-stamped products are now just inexpensive curiosities, available for $5 here and $10 there... if the seller's lucky.","9. Americana","With Americana popular around the same time as Coke-brand merchandise, everyone can picture this mid-century craze: Smallville, U.S.A. houses decorated from front to back with American flags and eagles in every shape, size and permutation. Americana collectors slept under Uncle Sam sheets, ate off of patriotic plates and hung their pictures in freedom frames.","Today? Not so much.","\"The frenzy of buying American collectibles and American antiques from the mid- and early-century definitely has taken a downturn,\" Griffith said.","As with virtually all collectibles, the rule isn't absolute. While prices will chase fads for most items, the really high quality or unique pieces will always retain at least some of their value. In fact, for collections past their prime, the truly valuable pieces may even go up in value as sets begin to fade away. As Marsha Dixey, consignment director with Heritage Auctions, explained, value of a collection has more to do with the run of the mill pieces than the truly outstanding ones. Collections become worthless, she said, when the majority of its pieces become little more than knick-knacks that anyone can get.","\"What things don't have a value anymore that people think should,\" she said. \"is one of those things that's totally driven by the collector group that's no longer interested and has dropped out of the marketplace.\"","By the time 99% of the pieces are available to anyone who wants them, it ceases to have value as a collection and instead is about singular artifacts.","8. Roseville Pottery","Where supply and demand is as old as the concept of trade itself, another major factor in eroding value is something brand new: the internet. It's what wiped out collectors of Roseville Pottery, and it will be back later on this list.","For years, Roseville Pottery was a collecting craze. While the company itself went out of business in 1954, Roseville's work continued to circulate, gaining value over the years as its work grew in popularity. Whether acquiring pieces at antique shops or roadside dealers, collectors prized every Roseville find they could claim, and as a result, prices shot through the roof.","Until the internet came along and put a stop to all that, by taking the mystery out of the pot.","\"One of the things that eBay and the internet did was pull the cover off years of false scarcity in the market,\" Griffith said. \"Suddenly the actual supply situation was revealed. Prior to the internet and sites like eBay, I could go searching in my car to different antique markets and shops, and it was rare. With the internet, I could connect to every piece of Roseville in the world.\"","What the internet revealed was how much prices depended not just on supply and demand, but also on regional supply and demand. A piece was as valuable as the supply of Roseville pots that the buyer could find, regardless of how many existed in the wide world. When the local antique store has just two pieces in stock, that can drive up some hard bargains. When shoppers can go home and Google up 800 more, not so much...","7. Thomas Kinkade Paintings","Another success story brought low by the internet, for a period of time in the '80s and '90s, Thomas Kinkade, the \"Painter of Light,\" was absolutely everywhere.","Now, to a degree, Kinkade's work was value-driven. His paintings are legitimately attractive, sometimes downright beautiful, and he was doing something with colors and warmth on canvas that didn't really exist in popular culture at that moment. Yet Kinkade was a victim of his own success, creating an entire company out of reprinting his paintings, complete with dedicated franchise galleries across the country and a $110 million IPO in 1994.","By its peak, Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries had 350 locations across the nation, before its bubble burst in a slow collapse began in the early 2000s, culminating in a bankruptcy filing in 2010.","What happened? A combination of the two factors we've already discussed: market glut and the internet. As Kinkade flooded the country with his prints, the value of the product in stores increasingly became an illusion. Prices represented how likely you were to find another Kinkade around the block -- \"local scarcity\" as Dixey put it, not how much the piece was objectively worth. The bubble would burst sooner or later, and internet marketplaces did the trick. Once prospective buyers could reach the thousands of works that T.K.S. Galleries had been pumping out for over a decade, the rest was just a matter of time.","6. Hummel Figurines","Most people have heard the name \"Hummel\" before. One of the most popular collectibles in American history, Hummel figurines are virtually synonymous with meticulously sorted rows of tchotchkes painstakingly assembled over the years.","Hummel first started producing its porcelain figurines in 1935 after the drawings of a German nun, Maria Innocentia Hummel. After GI's returned from Germany in the 1940s bearing gifts of these for their wives and girlfriends, the collections began to catch on, because there was enough scarcity to create a legitimate secondary market. No one could go to the shop and just get another, you had to hunt for what limited supply was out there.","Over the course of the 20th Century, Goebel, the parent company that owned Hummel, decided to break that model. Endless special editions and limited runs proliferated, all based on the proposition that pieces would continue to appreciate in value. Hummels were sold as an investment, while the very act of selling them in bulk undermined the scarcity that made them valuable in the first place.","Like with Thomas Kinkade's work, eventually buyers could readily find excess product, either from the manufacturer or a flooded secondary market. The value plummeted, and today, while some few retain their value, most are little more than paperweights.","5. Comic Books","If flooded markets and the internet have dragged down collections' value, what causes it in the first place? There must be some good reason why otherwise sane people shell out sometimes millions of dollars for a few colored pictures on musty paper.","The reason, Griffith explained, has much to do with emotion. It is often, he said, about a \"shared cultural moment.\" Collections, especially pop culture or mass produced works, are about the things we form an attachment to en masse. Hummel represented the end of the war years while Thomas Kinkade marketed his paintings to spaces where young couples would splurge on vacation.","A collectible is ultimately a personal decision that something has value far greater than the cost of its commodity, and prices can shoot up when society decides to embrace that collectively.","\"There is no greater evidence of that,\" Griffith said, \"than the explosion of the comic book industry into both collecting and media. The idea now that our biggest blockbusters are all based on comic book heroes is not coincidental to the fact that today's audience were all comic book readers when they were younger.\"","Unfortunately, despite the impression many people have of lost riches in the paperbacks of their youth, the reality is far more mundane. Aside from the highest value items, comic book collections are worth next to nothing these days. (Although Dixey disagreed with that, arguing that comic books \"are probably more solid than if you went out and purchased a very fine piece of Chippendale's Furniture.\")","4. Commemorative Plates","For some reason in the mid-century, the idea of memorializing shared moments on dinnerware became huge.","Historians are still struggling to explain it.","Nevertheless, plates commemorating ideas such as the Statue of Liberty Centennial, the World Series and Norman Rockwell's paintings exploded as collectibles, often fueled by QVC and late-night television.","The trouble is that, with no one company acting as the gatekeeper for any of these products, there was never any market scarcity to begin with. Unlike collectibles like Hummel figurines, whose manufacturer could have chosen to produce less, plates such as centennial and Norman Rockwell collections were simply stamped out by any company that had a potential buyer.","Although billed as a collector's item, these are products that never had any real value to begin with. Today, as the eBay listings show, these are all but worthless, with products such as the Statute of Liberty Centennial Plate selling for $0.99 and most Norman Rockwell ones going for $5 to $15 apiece.","3. Baseball Cards","Cards are another quintessential collector's item. Today much of the collector's world has shifted to trading card games, where the granddaddy of them all, Magic the Gathering, can still command enormous value. (A single card from that game can still fetch upwards of $30,000.)","Baseball cards, on the other hand, frequently disappoint.","It's not that baseball cards have no value. As long as the sport remains popular, so too will its cards. It's that they have far less value than people assume. While rare or exceptional cards can still fetch a bundle, most baseball cards are worthless. The disappointment settles in when people realize the difference between their expectations and reality. Those carefully hoarded collections from their youth, stacked up pieces of cardboard tucked away and sat on for 20 years, will fetch... well, maybe the price of lunch.","The reason goes back to cultural moments. America simply doesn't have the love affair with its pastime that we once did. When baseball resonated on an emotional level with almost everyone, collectors could sell their cards to almost anyone, and prices reflected that. Today, as interested has waned, so too has demand.","\"Those cultural moments change very quickly,\" Griffith said. \"If you think back, it was a year or two ago, the Seth Rogan movie The Interview and all the brew-ha-ha about Sony Pictures not releasing it. That was an interesting cultural moment, it popped up very quickly and then suddenly there were posters on eBay of this movie which looked like it may not be released which were selling for hundreds of dollars.\"","Today, those posters will go for a few bucks. Baseball fanaticism lasted a lot longer, and may someday be back, but for now, few of those cards are much of an investment.","2. Beanie Babies","\"Almost 20 years ago now, Beanie Babies came along ,and it created a furor,\" Dixey said. \"It started at a price point where people could afford to buy it... and then it escalated.\"","Dixey had a front row seat for the Beanie Baby explosion.","A brief fad, America practically lived and died on beanie babies for a period of time in the late '90s. For many Millennials, it stands out as the concept of collections as investments-turned-junk bond, and today we still talk about the market for these little plush toys in awe (the most expensive of which went for several thousand dollars).","As Slate's Mark Stern wrote of his own experience shopping for the plush toys in 1999:","The Britannia bear wasn't just a toy, we explained","it was an investment, projected to be worth thousands of dollars within a decade. Our father capitulated and bought us each a Britannia bear, which we dutifully kept in mint condition with the tag intact, reveling in its rarity while dreaming of the day it would be a hugely valuable collector's item.","One month later, the company that developed Beanie Babies abruptly announced that it would stop producing the toys at the end of the year... Today, the Britannia Beanie Baby sells for $10 on eBay.","Entire books have been written on the Beanie Bubble, but suffice to say that unless you're sitting on one of the Princess Diana bears (priced on eBay at an aspirational $343,000 to $450,000), that collection is worth, maybe, the gas money down to the Salvation Army.","1. Lunch Boxes","On the list of nice dreams, add the idea that the old Fraggle Rock lunch box you used to use for ham sandwiches and Gatorade might help send your kids to college. Now dispense with that notion altogether, because no matter how fiercely some people might seek to line their walls with them, these products just aren't that valuable.","\"I had some experience oh 15, 18 years ago with lunch boxes and bought and sold quite a number of them,\" Dixey said. \"There were some that were indeed rare, and they were bringing lots of money.\"","\"Then, all of a sudden, some things started coming out of the woodwork,\" Dixey added. \"You go back to the old adage of supply and demand. All of a sudden there's a glut of them and it brings the price down.\"","One of the biggest questions in this space is, consistently: why people have such a mismatch between value and expectations. Part of it is simple lack of research, but part, Griffith said, is the very human habit of wishful thinking.","\"I did a lot of time in the '70s as a picker going around to different homes with another antique dealer looking for merchandise to buy and sell,\" he said. \"What was amazing to me was how many people thought that what they had was way more valuable than it really was, and there was no real way to argue with them, nothing to point to.\"","Today, increasingly, the bubble is bursting with advent of internet information."],"targetTitle":"10 Worthless Collectibles And the Reasons

He said he and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also working for an overall truce in Syria.","The Russian leader said that once the Syrian army secures control of all of Aleppo, civilians will be able to return to their homes.","It was not immediately clear if western-backed Syrian opposition would accept such a location for peace talks with Mr Assad\u2019s government. A Turkish official said his country\u2019s aid organisations are helping Syrians who have been evacuated from Aleppo to a border area held by the opposition in Syria\u2019s Idlib province.","Deputy prime minister Veysi Kaynak said on Friday that \"20 buses from Aleppo have reached the safe zone under control of the Free Syrian Army in Idlib\". He said 30-35 injured people were being treated at the Sahra hospital just over the border.","Mr Kaynak said there had been a discussion with Syrian opposition forces over the possibility of establishing a centre \"within a security zone in Syria\". He told the private Dogan news agency that \"Idlib has no physical capacity to accommodate so many people\".","He estimated there are 80,000 to 100,000 individuals who would like to leave Aleppo under the ceasefire deal which Turkey helped broker.","He added that Turkey is willing to provide assistance to \"legitimate\" Syrian opposition groups to help meet their needs.

However, just because you can do something, doesn't mean you have to. The development team wants players of the new game to be abler to make their own decision as to how to play the game. This has apparently worked out so well that there's one major mechanic in the game you don't ever need to touch. I had a chance to sit down with both Watch Dogs 2 as well as the game's creative director where I learned that it's possible to beat Watch Dogs 2 without ever firing a gun. Something interesting is our LV Director, he finished the game without using the shooting mechanic...He used takedowns because sometimes in stealth you have to use them, but he never shot anyone. This is kind of our goal. You don't have to kill people and you don't have to shoot. Can we achieve that? Sometimes it's very difficult in a certain context, but we did it, so I'm super proud of that actually. The great appeal of open world games is that they're supposed to give you a variety of ways to attack any objective. However, quite often those same games tend to push you down a particular path, so one game mechanic is important in one mission and another is the focus later on. Ubisoft has tried to design Watch Dogs 2 so that players have more control. Jonathan Morin, the Creative Director of Watch Dogs 2 told me that while playing the game without guns isn't easy, it is possible. Instead, there are greater opportunities for using hacking in order to reach your goal. Every hackable object can be hacked in different ways, rather than just one, meaning that you have more control over how your environment reacts to you. The addition of rovers and drones also means that the player can get access to more areas without actually having to step foot in a place where you might be spotted. As a fan of the hacking aspect of the original Watch Dogs but not so much the Grand Theft Auto style gunplay, this more wide open world sounds much more interesting. I found myself far too often needing to fight off waves of enemies with a gun in the first game when I would much rather stun them with a hackable object before they even knew I was there. While my hands-on time with Watch Dogs 2 was limited, I can say I also never used a gun. Christopher Morin told me to \"think like a hacker\" while playing Watch Dogs 2, to consider how you can use the systems to solve the problems that you're dealing with. It gives the impression that the hacking aspect of the game has been set up more like a puzzle where the player will need to figure out how to hack the different parts of the game in order to solve it. However, the most important part of making that work is that you have to believe there is a solution. Based on the fact that you can apparently beat the game using only hacks and takedowns, it would appear the solution is possible. Will you try to beat Watch Dogs 2 without using a gun?

The Cowboys took 100 passes off his plate in 2014 and he won his only NFL passing title and the Cowboys finished 12-4. I've always said, the less Romo throws, the more I like him.

With Nintendo's attempt to unify game releases in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan the games are going to be released in both traditional and simplified Chinese. This may not seem like a big deal, but until now differences in culture and dialect have spawned a variety of translations. This is going to change with Sun and Moon and as reported by Zheping Huang in Quartz, this is what we'll see:","Now Nintendo wants to unify them: Poke\u0301mon in Greater China will be officially called \u7cbe\u9748\u5bf6\u53ef\u5922, or Jingling Baokemeng in Mandarin (Jingling means \"spirit\" or \"elf,\" and Baokemeng is a transliteration of Poke\u0301mon). Earlier in Hong Kong, it was \u5bf5\u7269\u5c0f\u7cbe\u9748 Pet Little Elves (or Spirits), while in Taiwan, it was \u795e\u5947\u5bf6\u8c9d, Magic Babies.","This probably makes sense if you live in any area with a singular dialect, but when you're trying to make one unified language version of a game to an area that has several unique dialects there are bound to be some twists.","Hong Kong is where one of these twists can be found - Hong Kong being where the common language has always been Cantonese, rather than Mandarin. Because Pokemon Sun and Moon will be translated into Mandarin now, it's causing a stir because Pikachu now has a new name!","That's Right, I said it, Pikachu is now Pikaqiu","Pikachu was originally translated as \u6bd4\u5361\u8d85 (Bei-kaa-chyu) in Hong Kong. Now it is named \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 (Pikaqiu). While the name \u76ae\u5361\u4e18 in Mandarin sounds similar to the global name Pikachu (as it was always called in China and Taiwan), it reads as Pei-kaa-jau in Cantonese, which doesn\u2019t sound the same at all.","Fans of the bright electric mouse have been protesting NIntendo's translating choice saying that they will never buy from Nintendo again. Although the protest has gained over 6,000 signatures for a petition against the decision, it looks as though Nintendo is sticking with the new translation."],"targetTitle":"Tell Me It's Not Pika-True!?

The impact of capitalist and heavily industrialised societies is equivalent to how an asteroid would impact the planet.","An equation aids in creating a manifestation of the risks of climate change through large-scale and widespread alterations to the planet. Owen Gaffney and Will Stephen of Australian National University drew up the equation, which was published in The Anthropocene Review journal, by homing in on the rate of change of Earth\u2019s life support system including the atmosphere, oceans, forests, waterway, ice sheets and other diverse limbs of the planet.","Owen Gaffney wrote in the New Scientist, \"For four billion years, the rate of change of the Earth system (E) has been a complex function of astronomical (A) and geophysical (G) forces plus internal dynamics (I): Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun, gravitational interactions with other planets, the sun\u2019s heat output, colliding continents, volcanoes and evolution, among others.\"","He added, \"In the equation, astronomical and geophysical forces tend to zero because of their slow nature or rarity, as do internal dynamics, for now. All these forces still exert pressure, but currently on orders of magnitude less than human impact.\"","Steffen says that these forces have changed our natural environment at a rate of 0.01 degrees Celsius per century. However, greenhouse gases as a result of human activity over the past 45 years \"have increased the rate of temperature rise to 1.7 degrees Celsius per century, dwarfing the natural background rate\".","According to the two authors, these figures represent a change that is 170 times faster than natural forces.","\"We are not saying the astronomical forces of our solar system or geological processes have disappeared, but in terms of their impact in such a short period of time they are now negligible compared with our own influence,\" Steffen said.","\"Crystallising this evidence in the form of a simple equation gives the current situation a clarity that the wealth of data often dilutes.","\"What we do is give a very specific number to show how humans are affecting the earth over a short timeframe. It shows that while other forces operate over millions of years, we as humans are having an impact at the same strength as the many of these other forces, but in the timeframe of just a couple of centuries.","\"The human magnitude of climate change looks more like a meteorite strike than a gradual change.\"","Planet Earth, they wrote, has proved its resilience beyond doubt as it has for millions of years withstood human meddling with the environment\u2019s most natural state of flux.

Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental.\" The cut-and-paste legal rider must be the most boring thing in every movie that features it. Who knew its origins were so lurid?","For that bit of boilerplate, we can indirectly thank none other than Grigori Rasputin, the famously hard-to-assassinate Russian mystic and intimate of the last, doomed Romanovs. It all started when an exiled Russian prince sued MGM in 1933 over the studio\u2019s Rasputin biopic, claiming that the American production did not accurately depict Rasputin\u2019s murder. And the prince ought to have known, having murdered him.","Here\u2019s the story. In 1916, the fabulously wealthy, Oxford-educated Prince Felix Yusupov was one of several Russian aristocrats agonizing over the unseemly influence that Rasputin\u2014the magical healer, charismatic lech, and peasant\u2014had over the czar and, particularly, the czarina. In December, Yusupov invited Rasputin to his palace, where he offered him cyanide-laced cakes and then shot him.","Although the czarina was distraught, the czar let Yusupov off lightly, exiling the prince and his wife Irina. (In doing so, he inadvertently spared them from the impending slaughter of the revolution.)","A Slate Plus Special Feature: Radio Drama Has Returned to the Spotlight\u2014Now What? The Culture Gabfest\u2019s producer explains why radio drama isn\u2019t dead. Listen to this special Slate Plus bonus segment by joining \u2013 your first two weeks are free.","Sixteen years later, MGM produced Rasputin and the Empress, based on those events. Its big coup was casting the three Barrymore siblings\u2014stars of stage and silent film\u2014in the lead roles. Lionel played Rasputin, Ethel the czarina, and John (grandfather of Drew) was \"Prince Paul Chegodieff,\" a composite, who murders Rasputin.","Yusupov, now penniless in Paris, heard about the film and thought it defamatory. He argued audiences would recognize him in the fictional assassin\u2014in part because he\u2019d publicly cashed in on his infamy, penning a braggy memoir about killing Rasputin. He wasn\u2019t wrong: The New York Times, in its review, noted that Chegodieff was \"really intended to represent [Yusupov].\"","But having copped to being a murderer, Yusupov couldn\u2019t build much of a libel case. Instead, he alleged that Rasputin and the Empress in fact defamed his wife.","In the film, Chegodieff\u2019s wife is \"Princess Natasha,\" a supporter of Rasputin. But the mystic, wary of her husband, hypnotizes and rapes her, rendering Natasha\u2014by his logic, with which she agrees\u2014unfit to be a wife. Yusupov contended that as viewers would equate Chegodieff with Yusupov, so would they link Natasha with Irina. But while Yusupov was portrayed more or less accurately, Irina and Rasputin had never met. (The scene also libeled Rasputin, but him being dead, you could say anything, then as now: \"Rasputin sucks,\" \"Rasputin liked to caress his big beard and give it little kisses,\" etc.)","An MGM researcher had pointed out this factual discrepancy to the studio during production and warned that the Yusupovs could sue; the studio fired her. MGM was satisfied, dramatically, with the rape scene, despite there being no basis for it in real life. If it was shock they were interested in, one could imagine them constructing a similar scene around Rasputin and the czarina\u2014about whom there were prurient rumors, which Rasputin himself encouraged by whipping his dick out in a restaurant and boasting of giving it to \"the old girl\"\u2014but MGM couldn\u2019t do that after casting a real-life brother and sister in those roles.","Poster via Wikimedia Commons","Irina Yusupov sued the studio, and the jury found in her favor, awarding her \u00a325,000, or about $125,000. MGM had to take the film out of circulation for decades and purge the offending scene for all time.","What proved to be MGM\u2019s undoing was its lack of deniability. Unwisely, they\u2019d prefaced the film with this: \"This concerns the destruction of an empire ... A few of the characters are still alive\u2014the rest met death by violence.\" From that, audiences could logically infer that the Yusupovs, being the only relevant characters still alive, were represented as the Chegodieffs.","A justice in the case told MGM that the studio might have stood a better chance had they incorporated a disclaimer stating the exact opposite: that the film was not intended as an accurate portrayal of real people or events.","Apparently overcautious in the wake of the landmark lawsuit, the film industry slapped that wording on everything. For decades, films disclaimed absolutely any relationship to reality\u2014even when it was patently untrue. The Jake LaMotta biopic Raging Bull credits LaMotta as a consultant and cites his memoir as a source text just minutes before asserting that he is the film\u2019s entirely fictional invention.","Comedy Central"],"targetTitle":"The Strange Reason Nearly Every Film Ends by Saying It\u2019s Fiction (You Guessed It: Rasputin!)","targetDescription":"Virtually every film in modern memory ends with some variation of the same disclaimer: \"This is a work of fiction.

A new internet craze involving our feline companions has unveiled another piece of strange information: For some utterly bizarre reason, they appear to be terrified \u2013 utterly terrified \u2013 of cucumbers.","In the vast majority of the videos, cat owners are seen sneaking up behind their pets as they\u2019re facing the other way \u2013 mostly eating \u2013 and placing the green, elongated vegetable behind them. As the cat turns around and spots the unexpected item, it loses its mind, leaps into the air, and gets away from it as fast as it can. In some videos, the cats then engage in a stare down with the cucumber, waiting in vain for it to make its first move.","But the question remains: Why on Earth are cats frightened by these innocuous vegetables?","To be fair, there aren\u2019t any videos of cats seeing a cucumber from a distance and then walking up to interrogate it, so perhaps it\u2019s the unexpected sight of a cucumber behind them that\u2019s frightening, not the cucumber itself: An unexpected pineapple would likely be just as jarring. As it turns out, Dr. Roger Mugford, a specialist in animal behavior, told the Telegraph: \"I think that the reaction is due to the novelty and unexpectedness of finding an unusual object secretly placed whilst their heads were down in the food bowl.\"","Cats are shown to be suspicious of anything that moves rapidly, makes a lot of noise, or lights up erratically: essentially, anything that they don\u2019t fully understand, which isn\u2019t really that different from most animals, including humans. It\u2019s also worth noting that cats are mostly solitary animals, and humans are as sociable as animals can be \u2013 so they\u2019re baffled enough by us as it is. Freaking them out with unexpected cucumbers probably isn\u2019t helping.","\"Cats have to be suspicious of the unknown: It could represent the danger of a snake or another predator,\" Mugford continued. \"I suspect that there would be the same reaction to a model spider, a plastic fish or a human face mask.\"","Well, there\u2019s only one way to find out.

{"postId":"376543708663283712","postText":["Is this @tomhanks best performance ever?"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play during the Academy Awards when Jennifer Lawrence announces Hanks as a Best Actor nominee on March 2, 2014. That Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner and five-time nominee, is at his very best before the key sequence in Paul Greengrass' new film should provide Oscar prognosticators with all they need to know about the 57-year-old actor's awards chances.","\"Captain Phillips\" is set to open the 2013 New York Film Festival, but Sony and producer Scott Rudin set up screenings this week for critics and journalists to see the film while all eyes are fixed on Toronto. Thus far, the move paid off: reviews have been solid, with some (In Contention editor Kris Tapley, HuffPost Entertainment's own Mike Ryan) more infatuated with the film than others (Variety critic Scott Foundas, The Wrap critic Alonso Duralde). Heed the words from the former camp: \"Captain Phillips\" stands at the very top of the recent spate of thinking-persons' action films from the last few years, on par with Kathryn Bigelow's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" and well ahead of Ben Affleck's Best Picture-winning \"Argo.\"","The reason is Hanks, who gives the type of performance everyone has wanted to see from Tom Hanks since the early 2000s. His Richard Phillips is not the most emotional of men: an opening scene with his wife (played very briefly but beautifully by Catherine Keener) establishes him as the kind of thoughtful, quiet type who one can assume watches the History Channel and likes Tommy Lee Jones movies. Yet as Greengrass keeps turning the screws on Phillips and his situation, that cool demeanor begins to crack, shatter and, later, turn to dust. Hanks is put through the ringer -- Greengrass' closed-quarters camera work keeps in him the action even as things get impossibly physical -- and the results are breathtaking. Like the best acting, Hanks' performance actually feels real. By the end of the film, it's hard to tell where Hanks ends and Phillips begins.","This is the time of year when a new Oscar front-runner debuts almost every day (\"Gravity\" and \"12 Years A Slave\" reached the top of the line after raves last week). Yet \"Captain Phillips\" belongs in those whispered early awards musings, not just for Hanks and Greengrass (a previous nominee for \"United 93,\" a film that bears similarities to \"Captain Phillips\" in structure and form), but for Best Editing (Christopher Rouse), Best Cinematography (Barry Ackroyd), Best Adapted Screenplay (Billy Ray) and, if a wave of support carries the film to multiple nominations, perhaps Best Supporting Actor for Barkhad Abdi. The newcomer plays Muse, the lead Somali pirate in the film, a relatively decent man turned to evil behavior by his standing in life. Abdi (and Barkhad Addirahman, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali as the other pirates) helps keep the film from ever truly demonizing Phillips' kidnappers, an easy pitfall that Greengrass deftly avoids. The problem is that Abdi doesn't have an easy road to Supporting Actor: the category is as loaded as usual, with actors like Daniel Bruhl (for \"Rush\"), Michael Fassbender (for \"12 Years A Slave\"), Josh Brolin (for \"Labor Day\"), Steve Coogan (for \"Philomena\"), Bradley Cooper (for \"American Hustle\") and even Hanks (for \"Saving Mr. Banks\") potentially standing in his way.","That, however, is back-room chatter for another day. For now, just know that \"Captain Phillips\" is one of those truly terrific movies that everyone hopes to see in the fall. It's riveting filmmaking.","\"Captain Phillips\" opens on Oct. 11."],"targetTitle":"Tom Hanks' Riveting Performance Makes 'Captain Phillips' One Of Year's Best So Far","targetDescription":"Tom Hanks has the scene in \"Captain Phillips,\" a moment that will play durin...","targetKeywords":"Tom Hanks,captain phillips tom hanks,barkhad abdi,fyc,captain phillips barkhad abdi,captain phillips paul greengrass,oscars 2014,captain phillips review,movie news,captain phillips","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1339129\/images\/o-TOM-HANKS-CAPTAIN-PHILLIPS-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/221717\/slide_221717_3826322_free.jpg","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/1339129\/images\/n-TOM-HANKS-CAPTAIN-PHILLIPS-628x314.jpg","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/1dNwi9O","id":343}

LOZANO, Associated Press","HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 Evidence from more than 6,600 rape kits that went untested for years in Houston have turned up 850 hits in the FBI's nationwide database of DNA profiles, marking a major step in the city's $6 million effort to address the backlog, officials announced Monday.","Charges have been filed against 29 people, six of whom have been convicted, since the city launched an effort in 2013 to test 6,663 rape kits \u2014 some of which dated back nearly three decades. Testing was completed in the fall, and the results have now been uploaded to a database used by investigators nationwide to compare DNA profiles of possible suspects, Mayor Annise Parker said.","\"This milestone is of special importance to rape survivors and their families and friends because it means their cases are receiving the attention they should have years ago,\" Parker said at a news conference, where she joined local law enforcement officials to announce the results.","Police are continuing to review the matches to see if charges can be filed in other cases. In the cases where prosecutors have won convictions, defendants have received sentences ranging from 2 to 45 years in prison. One case was dismissed after the victim decided not to pursue the case.","Rape kits include biological samples and physical evidence gathered from sexual assault victims that are later processed to see if they match a suspect's DNA. Testing results are uploaded to the FBI's Combined DNA Index System, or CODIS.","Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said there were some cases where suspects committed other crimes while rape kits that could have identified them sat untested.","\"Now that the testing of these kits is complete, we know that it's up to us to finish the job and to seek justice for these victims. The ball is in our court and we will do our best to put the people who are responsible for these heinous crimes behind bars for as long as possible,\" she said.","Experts say Houston's backlog \u2014 and similar backlogs in other U.S. cities \u2014 are due in part to the high cost of testing which can run from $500 to $1,000 per kit, though advocates argue that the lack of testing signals that sex crimes haven't always been law enforcement priorities.","More than 12,000 kits went untested for years in Memphis, Tennessee, which is facing a lawsuit from rape victims as it tries to test the kits. In Detroit, prosecutors discovered more than 11,000 rape kits in an abandoned police warehouse in 2009, and Cleveland prosecutors have sent their entire 4,700-kit backlog for testing.","\"This is not a Houston problem.

We were talking about how excited we were to attend an upcoming wedding in Kalamazoo (where we met and went to college) and discussing what would be the perfect gift for the newlyweds. So, I thought back to our wedding day (nearly 9 years ago) and tried to recall the gifts that had meant the most to me. The funny thing? The gift that meant the very most was still sitting in a closet... ... unopened. On our wedding day, my husband Brandon and I received a gift from my Great Aunt Alison. On the plain white box was a card that read, \"Do not open until your 1st disagreement.\" Now, there had obviously been plenty of disagreements, arguments and slammed doors throughout our 9 years. There were even a couple of instances where we both considered giving up... but we never opened the box. I honestly think that we both avoided turning to the box, because it would have symbolized our failure. To us, it would have meant that we didn\u2019t have what it takes to make our marriage work \u2013 and we\u2019re both too stubborn and determined for that. So, it forced us to reassess situations.

As my Great Uncle Bill would say, 'Nothing is ever so bad that it couldn\u2019t get worse.' All along, we assumed that the contents of that box held the key to saving a marriage \u2013 an age old trick \u2013 unbeknownst to us rookies. After all, my Great Aunt and Uncle had been married for nearly half a century. So, we thought the box would save \"us\" \u2013 and in a way it did. That box went beyond what I believe my Great Aunt had intended. It was by far the greatest wedding gift of all. For 9 years (and three moves) that box sat high on a shelf in various closets gathering dust, yet it somehow taught us about tolerance, understanding, compromise and patience. Our marriage strengthened as we became best friends, partners, and teammates. Today, we decided to open that box, because I finally had a realization.

She didn't realize just how special the gift was to us until a number of years after our wedding when she found out that we hadn\u2019t opened it yet.\"Aunt Alison was surprised that we kept it for nine years, then the lessons it taught us \u2013 inadvertently \u2013 and now she\u2019s even more surprised at the response our story has received.\"And when it comes to their best advice to other couples when it comes to handling disagreements, she says, \"For the little things, learn how to disagree and move on. For the bigger things, learn how to get mad and get over it. Giving up was never an option in our situation because we never had the illusion that marriage was going to be easy. Building that strong foundation is hard work \u2013 but once it\u2019s set, it will provide a lifetime of friendship, partnership and love.\""],"targetTitle":"Wedding Gift Opened After 9 Years At

But the fashionable garment isn't having quite the impact the editors likely anticipated.","When McCarthy's cover debuted last week, critics were quick to point out that the other November cover girls, including Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, were all styled in body-conscious outfits that flashed some skin. McCarthy, on the other hand, was dressed in a coat \"so huge,\" wrote Slate, \"that she could hide her Mike and Molly co-star Billy Gardel underneath.\"","Today, Elle has responded to the critics, defending its styling choices with the following statement:","\"On all of our shoots, our stylists work with the stars to choose pieces they feel good in, and this is no different: Melissa loved this look, and is gorgeous on our cover. We are thrilled to honor her as one of our Women in Hollywood this year.\"","Fashion magazines have long been accused of treating their curvier cover models differently than their stick-thin celeb cover girls. Vogue was hit with backlash in 2009 over an Adele shoot that showed her sprawled nearly facedown on a bed, her shape obscured; Vogue UK was faced with similar criticism over its Adele cover in 2011, which zoomed in on the singer's face so closely it cropped out her neck.","In fact, Elle faced similar accusations in 2010 with another series of covers. Back then, instead of Melissa McCarthy, Gabourey Sidibe was the curvy girl in the bunch; instead of Penelope Cruz and Reese Witherspoon, the other cover girls were Megan Fox, Lauren Conrad and Amanda Seyfried. The latter three were photographed from the knees up, showing off their full outfits, while Sidibe's cover photo was cropped at her chest.","Then, just as they did today, the folks at Elle denied any ill intent and said their choices for both photography and fashion styling were purely artistic.

But apart from smelling, microbiologists say there is nothing to worry about from a health perspective if you never wash your jeans.","Is not washing your jeans safe?","There is no evidence that not washing jeans is hazardous to your health, according to Bernhard Redl, an associate professor in the molecular biology department at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. This generally holds true when your denim is worn under normal conditions, such as everyday street wear.","Bacteria, skin cells, and sweat are transferred to our pants from our own body but \"skin microorganisms are generally not hazardous to ourselves,\" said Rachel McQueen, a professor of human ecology at the University of Alberta in Canada. McQueen's research focuses on the development and retention of odors in textiles.","\"There are environments where having sterile clothing is important,\" McQueen said. That would be true in a hospital, for example, where clothing can transfer infections. However, \"sanitizing your hands is going to be a more important issue here than washing your jeans,\" she said.","A few years ago, one of McQueen's students wore his jeans for 15 months straight without a single wash and then tested the level of bacteria on them. The student-teacher team was surprised to find that the unwashed jeans carried nearly the same amount of bacteria as those same pants after they had been washed and then worn for another 13 days.","\"What I found was just normal skin flora,\" McQueen told The National Post in 2011. \"The counts were really, really similar. The bacteria load from the swabbed areas were pretty much the same.\"","The freezing myth","Although not washing your jeans doesn't seem to pose any health risks, the smell could become a problem. Denim-heads have suggested freezing your jeans as a way to kill bacteria and the stench, although there is no scientific proof that this method is effective.","\"It is clear that freezing does not kill most of the bacteria,\" said Redl, \"but puts them in a dormant state.\" Bacteria stops growing in the freezer, but will become active again once you slip your pants back on and those germs are warmed up by the heat of your body.","\"I think airing your jeans outdoors in the sunlight would be a more effective method of getting rid of odors and a lot of bacteria,\" said McQueen."],"targetTitle":"Here's what happens if you never wash your jeans","targetDescription":"The argument for not washing your jeans has traditionally been about making your denim last longer -- hot water and detergent can speed up how quickly your jeans fade.

She simply combines one tablespoon of coconut oil with a pinch of turmeric to create a paste, brushes her teeth with the blend, lets it sit on her teeth for five minutes, then rinses it off for an instantly brighter grin. But be forewarned, this method will turn your toothbrush yellow.","Most Popular","Here's the thing, you won't see a drastic difference the first time you try it. The idea is that if you get into the habit of doing this a few times a week, it will\u2014like white strips\u2014work gradually over time. This is because turmeric, an ancient medicinal herb, helps removes plaque (some that's not evident to the naked eye), which causes discoloration. But as opposed to harsh bleaches you'll find in over-the-counter treatments, its natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties make it super healthy for your oral health, much like it is for the skin.

The likelihood went up with each extra day of snow, they reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.","\"We suspect that shoveling was the main mechanism linking snowfall with myocardial infarction (heart attack),\" Dr. Nathalie Auger of the University of Montreal Hospital Research Center and colleagues wrote.","\"Men are potentially more likely than women to shovel, particularly after heavy snowfalls. Snow shoveling is a demanding cardiovascular exercise requiring more than 75 percent of the maximum heart rate, particularly with heavy loads,\" they added.","The team studied 128,000 heart attack cases between 1981 and 2014, and more than 68,000 people who died.","A single day of snowfall raised a man's risk of heart attack by just less than 1 percent, they wrote, and it raised his risk of dying from a heart attack by 12 percent.","Eight inches of snowfall raised the risk 16 percent compared to a day in the same month that did not have snow, they reported, and men were one-third more likely to die of a heart attack the day after an eight-inch snowfall, compared to a dry day.","Women were not more likely to either have heart attacks or to die of them after snow, the team found.","Snow shoveling is hard. It's not a daily activity, and it strains the heart, Auger's team said. People often exhale hard with their mouths closed while lifting a heavy shovel full of snow, a dangerous habit called the Valsalva maneuver, they noted.","Using the arms intensively and repetitively, especially while standing upright, can also raise the risk that a piece will break off from a clogged artery, the researchers noted. Cold temperatures make blood vessels constrict, which adds to the danger.","It might not only be shoveling that does it. People using snow blowers have also been reported to have higher rates of heart attack, the Canadian team noted.","The National Safety Council has some advice for how to safely shovel snow:","Do not shovel after eating or while smoking Take it slow and stretch out before you begin Push the snow rather than lifting it If you do lift it, use a small shovel or only partially fill the shovel Lift with your legs, not your back Do not work to the point of exhaustion Talk to a doctor before shoveling if you have a history of heart disease Stop immediately if you feel dizzy or tightness in the chest"],"targetTitle":"Shoveling Snow Can Kill Men, Canadian Study Finds","targetDescription":"It's common wisdom that shoveling snow can give you a heart attack.

Police agencies won't let it"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["Minnesota will consider passing legislation to legalize the medical use of marijuana, but police agencies are standing in the way.","A bill in the state House of Representatives would legalize the possession and use of up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana for people suffering from a range of medical conditions including cancer, Tourette's syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder or any other medical condition approved by the state Commissioner of Health.","Patients would first need to obtain an ID card by getting written certification from a doctor, says measure HF 1818, which was introduced by Rep. Carly Melin (D-Hibbing) last spring.","There's evidence that state politicians are open to passing such a bill. A similar effort was approved by the Minnesota House and Senate in 2009 before being vetoed by then-Governor Tim Pawlenty (R).","This time around, Governor Mark Dayton (D) says he'd sign the bill -- but not without the support of Minnesota law enforcement agencies. So far, not a single agency has lent its support to the bill. Their opposition, according to a report in local paper St. Cloud Times, is based on fears that marijuana's medical benefits are still unproven, that any legalization effort will increase the drug's availability to kids and that the bill is too broad in listing qualifying conditions.","The head of one police agency put it another way: He openly admitted that he was worried legalizing weed for medical purposes might make it harder for police to get federal drug war dollars. Minnesota receives millions in anti-drug money from the White House every year, and asset seizures from drug raids have become an integral part of state police budgets, Politics In Minnesota reported earlier this month.","As a result, Melin has said she may draft a compromise bill to legalize marijuana extracts in pill or liquid form. While such a law would be much more restrictive in terms of which patients could receive cannabis for treatment, some law enforcement agencies have said they might be open to such a measure.","\"Obviously any compromise ... [is] disheartening for patients,\" Melin told the La Crosse Tribune. \"But we\u2019re facing reality around here, which is if we can get anything done there\u2019s going to have to be compromise.\"","Minnesota voters, on the other hand, have shown they overwhelmingly support legalizing medical marijuana in all its forms. A St. Cloud State University poll from last year found 76 percent support for the issue.","HF 1818 has been referred to the Health and Human Services Policy Committee and is scheduled to have a hearing Wednesday evening.

{"postId":"516ax1","postText":["How to fix lag in SSB4 on 3DS"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["There's no denying that Super Smash Bros 4 on the 3DS is a great game. The release date brought a fighter with many characters, lots of gameplay modes and frantic item-throwing fun. But nothing's perfect -- in the case of Smash Bros 4, the mulitplayer lag is a huge issue. Whether it be local multiplayer in Sm4sh or online, the game stutters early and often.","The game is superb -- which is why it pains us that no matter what stage we choose, our Smash Bros 4 fights always take place in Lag City. We got a hint of this when we did our review for SSB43DS but chalked it up to all other players being located halfway across the world in Japan. Now that the game's out in our country, we thought our lag issues would be alleviated. Boy were we wrong.","Now, don't get us wrong -- we agree with Louis CK . The fact that we can play a video game with anyone around the world is amazing. But Smash is serious business. Despite being a fighting game, the lag is pretty consistent. So, we quantified it.","(Smash bros)","Super Smash Bros 4 Lag: Online Multiplayer","We began our testing using both the For Fun and For Glory modes on the 3DS. Similar to when I played Sm4sh for the review, we experienced constant lag throughout gameplay. During our For Fun plays, button presses were consistently between .30 to .40 milliseconds late. Not a huge amount obviously, though certainly noticeable.","During our 3rd match during For Fun while playing online using our home wifi network, Smash Bros 4 decided to leave us indefinitely in the training mode (just before the match begins). We're not sure if this was a network problem, someone dropped off, or just a glitch in the game. Without the ability to hit the Home Button we were forced to turn it off. On to For Glory then.","(Smash Bros)","For Glory saw lag go as high as .63 milliseconds after buttons were pressed. Though similar to For Fun, the lag was consistent. If you're fine with pressing buttons twice just to make sure they register, you can complete a match relatively trouble free.","(Smash Bros)","SSB4: Local Multiplayer","Playing Smash with our Bros in person was a different story. For some reason having everyone in the same room made our multiplayer lag experience worse than the online equivalent. I and two others with the game sitting in a circle (err, triangle) not more than 5 feet from each other ran into considerable lag when playing Super Smash Bros 4.","We played the game for nearly 3 hours using various characters and stages. In a set of about 15 stages, the first few went off without a hitch -- with the occasional hiccup. The same couldn't be said for the second half of our marathon Smash session.","5 of the latter 7 matches lagged uncontrollably to the point where the loading spinner appeared on screen telling us to wait. Having one player completely lose all their stock lives with only 2 fighters remaining on screen didn't help the situation. Despite having never moved physically, the rate of waiting for the throbber varied -- at times reaching 3-4 seconds.","In a 2nd round of local Smash Bros 4 multiplayer \"testing\" (read: playing in the office, for science!) 2 players was much easier on the system. The most lag we encountered occurred when 2 human players and a 3rd CPU player was thrown in the mix. Surprisingly, 2 human players and 2 CPUs resulted in no lag.","(Smash Bros)","SSB4 Online Lag Fixes And Placebos","Having this much lag in a multiplayer game, especially one like Super Smash Bros 4, detracts from the overall experience. Though at least online the lag was consistent enough to get used to. The sporadic nature of local multiplayer's random loading dials and epic slow downs make more than 2 (human) player battles pretty annoying.","So guys, found out I had lag because of my #3ds aluminum case. #smashbros pic.twitter.com\/wd5lW2PQnS \u2014 Raymond Lancione (@raylancione) October 7, 2014","If anyone's having #SmashBros lag online, apparently it gets better if you plug in the charger while playing. \u2014 It was me, Milu! (@miluette) October 6, 2014","\"Connectivity can depend heavily on location so I really don\u2019t know what to say. At the very least, we\u2019ve confirmed that smooth play is possible under various conditions of external networks. During multi-player, you\u2019re connected with another player and sending light amounts of data back and forth, so if the game feels laggy, it\u2019s due to the connection speed. If you play when it\u2019s laggy, then the person you\u2019re playing with will experience the same lag, so it\u2019s best to play when the connection is clear.","During development, there were cases where we had too many people and the connection became sluggish, so we turned off our cell phones and the connection would clear up. It\u2019s best to avoid playing while streaming something or by a tethered connection. Free wi-fi spots are probably not very good either.\"","(Wordpress)","The Part Where I Complain About The 3DS Hardware","Something tells me the new 3DS was made because the current one can't handle Super Smash Bros. This is the first time a Smash game has been made available for handheld and already we've seen reports of broken circle pads and awkward control schemes . The 3DS charger improving the online performance likely hints at the processing power of Nintendo's hardware -- likely holding back in an effort to save battery life. Not to mention OG 3DS owners not getting access to the beloved C-stick.","Nintendo's hardware always lags behind the competition but they've been able to get around it by bringing us great games. But what happens when even your own killer first party title doesn't run properly on yesterday's hardware you swore by? Would the PS Vita have these lag issues? Could the Ice Climbers have part of Smash Bros for the iPhone ? (Not that you could ever seriously play Smash on a smartphone, but not the point).","Though all in all, Smash players now that the 3DS version isn't the real experience.

Sylvia Allen (R), would allow lawmakers to meet privately to negotiate and draft measures and would require them to have public debate only once a body takes an action, such as a vote. Arizona's current laws require that officials hold a public meeting any time a quorum discusses matters that could result in legal action.","State Sen. Carlyle Begay (D), one of the bill's co-sponsors, told The Huffington Post that the state's requirements on open meetings make it extremely difficult for lawmakers who represent rural areas, where officials have to travel hours to be in the same room, to accomplish anything. That can make it hard for officials to deal with matters that need urgent and swift attention, Begay said.","\"It's a way to update how our elected officials are able to converse to associate with elected officials they sit on boards with in a way that allows them to do their business, to advocate and represent the best interests of their communities a lot easier,\" Begay said. \"Right now it's a hardship for these officials because they have to post open meeting laws and post notice for simple discussions if they need to get together to address issues.\"","Begay said the bill isn't intended to give lawmakers an opportunity to discuss \"unethical or immoral criminal issues behind closed doors.\"","\"We're all held to a certain standard and I think that's the expectation that we're not trying to decrease transparency and openness but we're leaving that discretion to the elected officials themselves to ensure that when public input and public comment is needed that they do that,\" he said.","In fact, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun that the state's open meetings laws produce an undemocratic law-making process. Because officials aren't allowed to meet privately to discuss legislation, officials must send staffers to serve as a go-between among colleagues to reach a consensus. That process, Allen told the Arizona Daily Sun, is undemocratic because it allows unelected staff members to play a central role in drafting laws.","\"Staff wasn't elected, staff isn't accountable,\" Allen told the Daily Sun.","Dan Barr, a First Amendment lawyer with the firm Perkins Coie, said the time when a policy is deliberated before a measure is introduced is a critical point for public input.","\"It allows you to see how your various public officials are approaching their jobs, how they view certain issues, what their thought process is, what their reasoning process is,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"It allows people then to participate in that.\"","Barr added that open meetings laws shouldn't be weakened just because they make the lives of elected officials more difficult.","\"Efficiency in government is not the primary goal of a democracy,\" Barr told The Huffington Post. \"Our whole theory of government is that the people are the governors and that they give limited power to the government, and for the public to adequately assess what its government is doing, it needs as much transparency as possible.\""],"targetTitle":"Arizona Senators Want To Make It Easier To Legislate Behind Closed Doors","targetDescription":"WASHINGTON -- Arizona lawmakers are pushing to provide elected officials with more privacy as they draft legislation because they say the state's require...","targetKeywords":"arizona open meetings law,arizona,Arizona Legislature,open meetings laws,arizona transparency,sylvia allen,Carlyle Begay","targetMedia":["http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/Logo_HuffingtonPost-1f66cbef067771f8508930828f764bc8bf8c4b027e58e14e07d207a9f0ce1d31.svg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/2578522\/images\/n-ARIZONA-LEGISLATURE-628x314.jpg","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gadgets\/slideshows\/241737\/slide_241737_1302391_free.jpg","http:\/\/b.scorecardresearch.com\/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/callout_highlight_icon-930f97b89eddc7188ad1c1e0a96bc1359e94a46ea21239c3c5ca3f25c543eaeb.gif","http:\/\/s.m.huffpost.com\/assets\/snapchat-QR-56da75d622f38e76ff0d3dec97344808f972f51020435d37d55c6f0e2eaec780.png","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=10153394098876130&ev=PageView&noscript=1","http:\/\/i.huffpost.com\/gen\/2578522\/images\/o-ARIZONA-LEGISLATURE-facebook.jpg","http:\/\/secure-us.imrworldwide.com\/cgi-bin\/m?ci=us-703240h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript","https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/tr?id=1621685564716533&ev=PageView&noscript=1"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/huff.to\/16IYWIX","id":366}

Do you want to tell which state Springfield is in?\"","So by this point, with \"The Simpsons\" entering its 28th season and still officially maintaining the mystery, any clue as to where the real Springfield is could be noteworthy.","The Simpson family has resided in the American town of Springfield for nearly three decades. But despite millions of fellow Americans watching their lives every week, nobody has ever figured out where their \"Springfield\" actually is. The town name is extremely popular in this country and the family\u2019s creator, Matt Groening, has never quite revealed its true location.","Groening has actually said in the past that the Springfield in the show was named after Springfield, Oregon, but didn\u2019t go so far as to admit \"street names and locations\" were, as well.","In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece In 2012, Smithsonian Magazine titled a piece \"Matt Groening Reveals the Location of the Real Springfield.\" Here\u2019s part of the piece that gets into the Oregon connection:","OK, why do the Simpsons live in a town called Springfield? Isn\u2019t that a little generic? Springfield was named after Springfield, Oregon. The only reason is that when I was a kid, the TV show \"Father Knows Best\" took place in the town of Springfield, and I was thrilled because I imagined that it was the town next to Portland, my hometown. When I grew up, I realized it was just a fictitious name. I also figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, \"This will be cool; everyone will think it\u2019s their Springfield.\" And they do. You\u2019ve never said it was named after Springfield, Oregon, before, have you? I don\u2019t want to ruin it for people, you know? Whenever people say it\u2019s Springfield, Ohio, or Springfield, Massachusetts, or Springfield, wherever, I always go, \"Yup, that\u2019s right.\"","This article led to quite a bit of backtracking from both Groening and Jean as they then claimed the location of the town still remained a mystery. The show responded to the article with a chalkboard gag where Bart Simpson repeatedly wrote, \"The true location of Springfield is in any state but yours.\"","Jean told Jean told TV Guide at the time that Smithsonian Magazine \"misinterpreted something [he has] heard [Groening] say for at least 10 or 20 years.\" Jean continued, \"He was inspired by growing up in Portland, but it\u2019s really an every town. It\u2019s really funny. Matt grew up in Oregon and parts of \u2018The Simpsons\u2019 were definitely inspired by his childhood. But there is no specific state that Springfield is in, and we will never reveal that secret.\"","Further trying to dispel that Groening revealed the location, Jean reminded TV Guide readers that \"The Simpsons Movie\" hinted that the town\u2019s true whereabouts are geographically impossible.","\"In the movie we say [Springfield] borders on Ohio, Nevada, Maine and Kentucky,\" said Jean. \"So good luck finding that state. When you do, you\u2019re a true \u2018Simpsons\u2019 fan.\"","For what it\u2019s worth, Ohio has a city named Oregon. The state of Oregon does border Nevada. The city of Portland, Oregon, was named after the city of Portland, Maine. And there is an unincorporated community that calls itself \"Oregon\" in Kentucky.","In a way (however tenuous), all of those named states from the movie have geographical connections to Oregon. \"The Simpsons\" Springfield = Springfield, Oregon. The homepage of the official website for the Oregonian city even claims, \"Yes, this is the \u2018real\u2019 Springfield from \u2018The Simpsons.\u2019\"","Of course, even if this is true, Jean and Groening will likely never fully admit it. Jean continued his answer about Springfield, Oregon, during the press conference by saying, \"But the great thing about [the show\u2019s city] is it\u2019s universal. I grew up in Michigan, and I can totally relate to it. Anybody, wherever you\u2019re from, has a Springfield near them.\"","The people of Oregon are just especially close.","Here\u2019s a walkthrough of Universal Studios\u2019 recreation of Springfield:"],"targetTitle":"Here's A New Clue About Where 'The Simpsons' Actually Takes Place","targetDescription":"The mystery of Springfield's real location is now more or less over.","targetKeywords":"The Simpsons,mystery,al jean,springfield,matt groening","targetMedia":["http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/652f241a46f4d98a120ea039c0adff0a467af2d5.svg","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/8053f47ed5d9897a26ee1d208b2a2816190e5a51\/scr.png","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/61e229eb78d09bc79f4bddd0b3ad5448a6bce919.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/77af1740db9fc764fb0e37c5766f60baacc7b2e4.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/927088bc29f6c3b7fa5e7b0897c26180367aa6bd.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/0bcb8f9d4567ff0e87001b8d84549037aa2834f4.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/4fd5cd6691b7a6ecf056b888e13167db15cd2a8e.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/003cb3bb3bdfef6f73e31a80e7c1fa21b2d15a1e.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/e2ae0ae036ff79fd0f460f657aa2d73e43446dd7.jpeg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/1bd74219c7467e46782c9f6d13797b7253e58d4b.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/2c3e12d6d2b750e8aeae88bafc47a711cfdfbaf6.jpeg","data:;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP\/\/\/8DAwCH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mNgYPjPAAACAwEA97bufQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/147fccce435c5bcddc2e0a9c1a164788eb086543.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/aadb3001b6b6400a3d12ce9cd65b42d9c1348ee6.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/1180dc9d8c378ca0f9e0921922304bff7790e581.jpeg","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/1a1f088b9d30646677c7e46bdec49f394fab624c.gif","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/f3bb9b96d5e1b095c597556015dca75ed26bffcc.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/1fc45afdf39fa9747c6e1c4812d51b732e8e400e.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya\/150a4e5b826cabc539cc90e3de1291e74f51f80a.png"],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/vm1Ya","id":368}

When a fan asked Rowling what form Hagrid's Patronus would take \u2013 a great question, considering Hagrid's unusual taste in pets \u2013 she replied : \"Hagrid couldn't produce a Patronus. It's a very difficult spell.\"","In both the books and the films, the Patronus charm is one of the most powerful defense spells a witch or wizard can cast to ward off Dementors, the dark creatures that feed off human happiness.","It's one of the most complex spells in the wizarding world, and in order to conjure a Patronus, a wizard needs to draw upon his most powerful happy memory. The Charm conjures a magical guardian in the shape of the animal with whom the witch or wizard shares the greatest affinity.","Rowling's response may point to the fact that the spell is simply too difficult for Hagrid, who was expelled from Hogwarts as a teenager, to perform. But fans were also worried that the lovable half-giant, abandoned by his mother as a child, may just not have enough happy memories to produce a Patronus. Oh, Hagrid!"],"targetTitle":"J.K.

Rubbing? Grinding?). To keep things simple and specific, we\u2019ll just focus on the time to ejaculation.","Measuring an average time to ejaculation is not a straightforward matter. What about just asking people how long they take, you say? Well, there are two main problems with this. One is that people are likely to be biased upwards in their time estimates, because it\u2019s socially desirable to say you go long into the night.","The other problem is that people don\u2019t necessarily know how long they go for. Sex isn\u2019t something people normally do while monitoring the bedside clock, and unassisted time estimation may be difficult during a transportative session of love-making.","What does the research say?","The best study we have estimating the average time to ejaculation in the general population involved 500 couples from around the world timing themselves having sex over a four-week period \u2013 using a stopwatch.","That is as practically awkward as it sounds: participants pressed \"start\" at penile penetration and \"stop\" at ejaculation. You may note this could affect the mood somewhat, and might perhaps not exactly reflect the natural flow of things. But \u2013 science is rarely perfect, and this is the best we\u2019ve got.","So what did the researchers find? The most striking result is that there was a huge amount of variation. The average time for each couple (that is, averaged across all the times they had sex) ranged from 33 seconds to 44 minutes. That\u2019s an 80-fold difference.","\ue607 Where tech meets sex \ue612 \ue611","\ue607 6 show all \ue603 \ue607 Where tech meets sex","\ue612 \ue611 1\/6 Lovely - the smart sex toy that has been dubbed 'the Fitbit for your penis' Tired of not being able to track the average speed of your thrusts during sex?

Introducing The Wankband: The first wearable tech that allows you to love the planet by loving yourself.\" The band creates power when moved in an up and down motion, with a kinetic charger inside storing the clean (albeit slightly dirty) energy generated. It can then be connected via USB to smartphones, tablets and computers, powering them with 100% sustainable energy PornHub","4\/6 Men have begun 3D-printing their penises \"What would happen if I put my penis in it?\" It's a question man has been asking ever since it discovered it was useful in certain situations for procreation thousands of years ago. But now it has reached an absurd and mildly dystopian conclusion: 3D-printed d*ck pics. The means? A handheld 3D scanner such as Fuel3D's Scanify above. The method? By pointing it at *any* object and capturing it three-dimensionally. The reason? Who can say Fuel3D","5\/6 Japanese developer creates virtual breast-squeezing 'game' for the Oculus Rift Although gadgets like the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR are promising to take virtual reality into the mainstream, there are still plenty of virtual \u2018experiences\u2019 that we hope never make it out the basements they were dreamt up in. Exhibit a: a \u2018game\u2019 which lets users squeeze a virtual woman\u2019s breasts who responds by squealing in disgust and covering up her chest. That\u2019s right, the guy who made this didn\u2019t even want to fabricate a positive sexual experience \u2013 instead he went for virtual abuse. The set-up works like this. The user dons an Oculus Rift to enter the virtual world populated by an anime character, he can then squeeze a novelty mouse pad with foam breasts with pressure sensors inside them.

The company launched Fleshlight Launchpad, which allows users of their flashlight-shaped, vagina-like toy to plug it into the back of an iPad in order to 'fully immerse themselves' in whatever they're watching. The gadget \"enables the user to enjoy the full Fleshlight experience while enjoying content or communicating live with a friend via applications like Facetime or Skype,\" makers Interactive Life Forms claim, with its trailer showing a man making use of one while video-chatting with his girlfriend","So it\u2019s clear there\u2019s no one \"normal\" amount of time to have sex. The average (median, technically) across all couples, though, was 5.4 minutes. This means that if you line up the 500 couples from shortest sex to longest sex, the middle couple goes for an average of 5.4 minutes each time they do it.","There were some interesting secondary results, too. For example, condom use didn\u2019t seem to affect the time, and neither did men\u2019s being circumcised or not, which challenges some conventional wisdom regarding penile sensitivity and its relationship to staying power in the sack.","It didn\u2019t much matter which country the couples came from either \u2013 unless they came from Turkey, in which case their sex tended to be significantly shorter (3.7 minutes) than couples from other countries (Netherlands, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Another surprising finding was that the older the couple, the shorter the sex, contrary to the prevailing wisdom (probably peddled by older men).","Why do we have sex for so long?","As an evolutionary researcher, all this talk of how long sex lasts make me wonder: Why does it last any time at all? All sex really needs to achieve, it seems, is to put sperm into the vagina. Why all the thrusting and bumping? Instead of sliding the penis in and out many hundreds of times per sexual session, why not just put it in once, ejaculate, and then go have a lemonade and get on with the rest of the day?","Before you say, Because it\u2019s fun to go in and out!, remember evolution doesn\u2019t care about fun per se \u2013 it generally only \"designs\" things to be enjoyable if they helped our ancestors pass on their genes to future generations. For example, even though we like eating food, we don\u2019t chew each mouthful of it for five minutes just to make the enjoyment last longer. That would be inefficient, and so we\u2019ve evolved to find it gross.","\ue001 \ue001 Play Current Time 0:00 \/ Duration Time 0:00 Remaining Time -0:00 Stream Type LIVE Loaded : 0% Progress : 0% 00:00 \ue000 Fullscreen Playback Rate 1 \ue00c Subtitles subtitles off \ue008 Captions captions settings","captions settings captions off \ue00c Chapters Chapters \ue006 Mute 00:00 \ue805 Share Foreground --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Opaque Background --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Window --- White Black Red Green Blue Yellow Magenta Cyan --- Opaque Semi-Transparent Transparent Font Size 50% 75% 100% 125% 150% 175% 200% 300% 400% Text Edge Style None Raised Depressed Uniform Dropshadow Font Family Default Monospace Serif Proportional Serif Monospace Sans-Serif Proportional Sans-Serif Casual Script Small Caps Defaults Done \ue800 Close Share Video: Share via: \ue801 Facebook","\ue802 Google+","\ue803 Twitter","\ue804 tumblr","\ue806 Pinterest","\ue807 LinkedIn Start From: Direct Link: Embed Code: \ue808 Restart The UK's favourite sex positions","Why we last so long is a pretty complicated question with no clear answer, but a clue may be in the way the penis is shaped. In 2003, researchers showed \u2013 using artificial vaginas, artificial penises, and artificial sperm (corn syrup) \u2013 that the ridge around the head of the penis actually scoops out pre-existing syrup from the vagina.","What this suggests is that men\u2019s repeated thrusting might function to displace other men\u2019s semen before ejaculating, ensuring their own swimmers have a better chance of reaching the egg first. Incidentally, this could explain why it becomes painful for a man to continue thrusting after ejaculating, since that would risk scooping out his own semen as well.","So what to do with this information? My advice would be to try not to think about it during the throes of passion.","By Brendan Zietsch, Research Fellow at the University of Queensland","This article was originally published in The Conversation .

{"postId":"557xov","postText":["The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GOD"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["In the classic 1966 science fiction film, Fantastic Voyage , a submarine is shrunk to microscopic size and injected into the blood stream of a scientist to remove a blood clot in his brain. The film illustrates many aspects of biology, perhaps most memorably when Raquel Welch ventures out of the submarine and is attacked by antibody molecules, which recognise her as a foreign invader and try to destroy her.","The antibodies of the film look like wriggly bits of string that rush at her and then adapt themselves to the shape of her body. For an immunologist Fantastic Voyage is interesting as it was made when there were competing theories of how antibodies worked","One, the instructional theory, suggested that all antibody molecules were the same, but they folded themselves around their target and learned its shape \u2013 to forestall future invasions \u2013 before destroying it. The alternative \u2013 clonal selection theory \u2013 says that there were billions of different antibodies, each with a different shape. Each B cell (a type of immune cell) specialises in making just one type of antibody. When a foreign invader, such as bacteria, enters the body, only one B cell will recognise it. That B cell would begin to rapidly divide, making large numbers of clones. These newly cloned B cells secrete large amounts of antibody which stick to the invader and mark it for destruction.","The instructional theory was championed by no less a person than two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling , while Macfarlane Burnet (also a Nobel Prize winner) was the key proponent of clonal selection . The makers of the film followed Pauling, though, whether this was for scientific reasons or because the interaction between stringy antibodies and Welch made for better cinema isn\u2019t clear. However, they were wrong, clonal selection theory won the argument.","Nowadays clonal selection seems so obviously right that it is difficult to remember that it initially appeared to have a fatal flaw. Scientists knew that the immune system of an animal could make antibodies to any foreign antigen. In the 1930s Karl Landsteiner showed that antibodies could be made to chemicals that never even existed naturally.","This led to a problem: for the clonal theory to be correct, there had to be pre-existing antibodies in animals or humans capable of recognising any antigen that might ever exist. This would require billions of different antibodies. And as every antibody is encoded by a separate gene, for there to be billions of antibody molecules there would also have to be billions of different genes. But there are no more than 25,000 genes to encode for everything in the human body, considerably fewer than needed to make the clonal selection theory possible.","The GOD problem","in several In the 1960s and 70s immunologists were increasingly convinced by the clonal selection theory. This led to a race to discover the solution to the problem of how so many different antibodies could be encoded. It was termed the \"generation of diversity\", or GOD problem. The GOD problem was such an important and intriguing question that it attracted many of the best scientists of the decade, and resulted Nobel Prizes . Scientists showed that GOD was due to several biological mechanisms that people had not realised could happen, including rearrangement of chunks of DNA in chromosomes, and deliberate mutation of DNA sequences","The difficulty and novelty of the science meant that immunologists had to develop new technologies. And some of these techniques, which were used to answer fundamental questions, ended up having practical applications. Perhaps most notably Ce\u0301sar Milstein was interested in understanding how, during an immune response, antibodies improve and become better at binding to their antigens. He wanted to immunise an animal and then, at various times, isolate B cells to make antibodies. He could then use these to study how well they bound to their antigen, and also sequence the gene encoding the antibody to see how it changed over time. In doing so he developed, together with Georges Ko\u0308hler in 1975, a method that made B cells live forever, making limitless amounts of what they called a monoclonal antibody","Milstein realised that their technique, called hybridoma technology, had much wider applications in science and medicine. The impact of monoclonal antibodies as scientific tools and for the treatment of diseases has been immense. Because they can be made in large amounts, and are specific, they are used in many experiments and clinical tests. They have now also become an important type of drug , having an important role to play in treating many cancers as well as other diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis . In economic terms, monoclonal antibody therapies are estimated to have had sales of US$75 billion in 2013.","In an age that demands that science is useful and should be applied, it is perhaps worth remembering that one of the most important technologies in medicine and biology was developed to answer a very basic scientific question. Scientists are motivated to develop new techniques to answer important questions. They often later find that these techniques have important practical applications beyond their original purpose. Applications that could save millions of lives."],"targetTitle":"The antibodies that were invented to help immunologists find GOD","targetDescription":"Why it's important to fund blue-skies research.","targetKeywords":null,"targetMedia":["data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/6229dbe03258e9a6d135098b1d44f3a14d8e0d53.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/5c2063c49313ec0b30816895e6ee8c6f12ac29da.jpg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/e1656760e72d78a592c0924f5708b07ad532f308.svg","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/8e5880d31ff5e8ff4d3a63fca34ee61113d51d5f.gif","data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOwo=","data:image\/png;base64,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","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/9bc3eea387724c5fad309d31cbe6571d93548727.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/3339d7646556dcb127e1ffde5cb76dcc2e2b4b46\/scr.png","http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i\/004d8e4786193d3a5ba495a0fc3e87c86fdb39de.jpg","data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABgAAAAYCAMAAADXqc3KAAAATlBMVEUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADEoqZZAAAAGXRSTlMAAhXQyPf4D9gbEvYMwwfu582+tXa7gG0c7UlRPQAAAKtJREFUKM99klcSgzAMRLExJnEhoaTs\/S8alB1cCEFf2vfwjKShOSvVKFXFlIL0GYete\/lJi2Fyc7cwhTvQroa8N8DN8asHPA25R2xYukX3NcLX9nIlV8kkrmrjQuaFsTARNvHK7Hga01oOV4shihj7owcAn\/zw0ezMtpd2MnU2xb66MnlflQxrhuf83MdjEsqzk9PI2dkvMO\/ibhHPLbmhHHFwhz+D9Ex\/6gNJowqlzHFZ\/gAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="],"targetUrl":"http:\/\/archive.is\/Zwc7i","id":384}

Although KFC has since denied that this is the exact formula, we assume that it's close. The nephew, Joe Ledington, did have it in a handwritten note taken from the colonel's second wife's will, and he claims that his job as a boy was to mix the spice blend in a tub.","The famous blend of 11 herbs and spices includes only one real surprise: a ton of white pepper.","\"The main ingredient is white pepper,\" Ledington told the Chicago Tribune. \"I call that the secret ingredient. Nobody knew what white pepper was. Nobody knew how to use it\" in the 1950s.","Food scientist Dr. Steven Witherly, author of \"Why Humans Like Junk Food,\" was taken aback when he saw the recipe.","\"Wow, that much white pepper?\" he says was his first reaction.","But he also thinks that it makes a lot of sense.","\"I've had a lot of chefs tell me that the most underappreciated of all spices is white pepper because it has subtle but very strong effects on the sensory system,\" Witherly said.","White pepper is the husked form of the more common black pepper. Cooks Illustrated says that it has a more floral, earthy flavor and greater complexity, while black pepper is more aromatic with more spicy heat. Interestingly, Google searches for white pepper have doubled over the past decade.","White pepper also has some powerful physiological effects thanks to a compound called piperine. Piperine has been shown to do a wide variety of things, including activating taste receptors to make salt taste saltier and sugar taste sweeter, activating a special receptor in your brain that triggers the release of feel-good endorphins, increasing intestinal water flow and production of digestive enzymes, and possibly even helping to counteract the effects of high-fat diets.","The upshot, according to Witherly, is that it could make KFC more addicting.","\"One of the theories I've put forth is that if you eat something that does something to you and it's beneficial, your brain figures it out ... it wants you to do it again,\" Witherly says.","KFC's alleged secret recipe is as follows:","2 cups white flour plus 2\/3 tbsp. salt","1\/2 tbsp. thyme","1\/2 tbsp. basil","1\/3 tbsp. oregano","1 tbsp. celery salt","1 tbsp. black pepper","1 tbsp. dried mustard","4 tbsp. paprika","2 tbsp. garlic salt","1 tbsp. ground ginger","3 tbsp. white pepper","As great as white pepper may be, of course, other factors may be more important in making it delicious. Witherly concludes in \"Why Humans Like Junk Food\" that the key to KFC's deliciousness is the combination of flavor-active compounds flour, salt, pepper, and MSG with a pressure-cooking technique that retains the chicken's moistness and juiciness.","And that's why 12 million people eat KFC every day."],"targetTitle":"KFC's secret ingredient is 'the most underappreciated spice' in the world","targetDescription":"\"The main ingredient is white pepper.

{"postId":"595980153529999360","postText":["Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot"],"postPlatform":"Twitter","targetParagraphs":["I was sitting around the fire pit in my backyard with a handful of straight male friends when drunken conversation inevitably turned to sex. The perverted powwow officially began when one friend, let\u2019s call him Freddy, announced something to the effect of, \"Having your prostate milked is awesome.\"","I nearly choked on my beer. Someone else chimed in: \"It\u2019s the male g-spot.\" Another head nodded. A female friend walked into our circle at that moment and nonchalantly volunteered: \"Yeah, my ex-boyfriend liked me to stick a finger in his butt.\"","Well, then. It wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d heard young heterosexual men talking about being on the receiving end of a wandering finger, or female friends dishing on their male partners\u2019 self-directed anal fixation, but the consensus in the room was startling nonetheless. For perhaps the first time in my life, I felt like a sexual square.","Then, a week later, heavily circulated rumors (that have been completely unverified) alleged that R&B singer Usher\u2019s unreleased sex tape showed him on the receiving end of sex with his wife (perhaps wielding a strap-on). It\u2019s no secret that more Americans are having anal sex than ever before: A study published last year in the Journal of Sexual Medicine found that more than 45 percent of women in their late 20s had tried anal sex. For my generation, the back-door option is like what the blow job was to the generation that came before \u2014 just a fun new taboo waiting to be broken. The phenomenon of heterosexual guys participating in all sorts of arse play is something different, though. I\u2019ve seen female-on-male strap-on sex go from the sort of thing tittered about in women\u2019s magazines to hearing a male friend once drunkenly blurting out in a bar that he loved it.","But I live in San Francisco; my sample is skewed. I set out to find some reliable data on the matter, but no such luck. As Debby Herbenick, a co-author of the study mentioned above and a sexual health educator at the Kinsey Institute, told me: \"There is no good national-level data on this topic.\" Her research reflected that 11 percent of men in their early 20s reported having been on the receiving end of anal sex. But that survey didn\u2019t specify whether there was a sex toy or penis involved, or if it was oral or digital stimulation.","Without solid stats, the best way to get some perspective on this phenomenon is to talk to sexologists. Charlie Glickman, a Good Vibrations sex educator, told me that he believed \"more heterosexual men are discovering prostate and anal play with their female partners than ever before.\" His colleague Carol Queen, a staff sexologist, says, \"Lots of guys don\u2019t talk about [it], but do it anyway,\" and \"plenty of heterosexual men include anal penetration in masturbation at least sometimes.\" In the years after her educational X-rated video \"Bend Over Boyfriend\" premiered in 1998, it was the shop\u2019s best-selling tape, and the top rental. Tristan Taormino, the sex educator behind several anal-focused porn flicks, including the \"Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men,\" has noticed that guys are increasingly \"feeling safe enough to explore their fantasies\" in this area.","Part of this is due to the practice rising to mainstream awareness. In 2001, popular sex columnist Dan Savage held a contest to come up with a slang word to describe the act. The winner was \"peg\" (the runner-up was \"bob,\" as in \"bend over boyfriend\"). It\u2019s a lot easier to talk about when you have a cute verb to describe it. Another major factor is that the stigma of receptive anal play as \"a gay thing\" has been somewhat lessened. I\u2019ve seen defensively heterosexual guys boast about prostate stimulation; these are the kind of guys I\u2019ve actually heard use the irritating I\u2019m-not-gay qualifier \"No homo\" (as in, \"I like your shirt \u2014 no homo\") \u2014 before I wallop them over the head. They haven\u2019t adopted a more fluid understanding of sexual orientation or anything; they\u2019ve just welcomed a new form of stimulation into their definition of acceptable straight sex. As Carol Queen joked, \"I wish I had a nickel for every time I\u2019ve had to explain that it is the gender of the partner rather than the sex act desired that speaks to a person\u2019s sexual orientation.\""],"targetTitle":"Bringing up the rear","targetDescription":"Sex experts think that more straight men are exploring a formerly taboo hot spot.

{"postId":"50n41z","postText":["Things in the Olsen twins' lives that make no sense"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["It kind of goes without saying that any hope for a normal life gets dashed for people who become millionaires before they can even walk, but Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, who famously portrayed Michelle Tanner on the smash sitcom Full House, cranked the dial on their wacky personal lives all the way up to 11.","With everything from their strange dating preferences, to some questionable business practices, to Mary-Kate's still-unexplained connection to the death of Heath Ledger, the Olsen twins have led bizarre lives since leaving the TGIF lineup. Though they've found massive success in an entirely separate business \u2014 the fashion world, and they've also become increasingly reclusive. And they don't smile. But we're getting ahead of ourselves here. There's a lot to unpack when it comes to the mysterious world of the Olsen twins, so let's dive right in and find out just how peculiar Mary-Kate and Ashley's lives have become.","Banking on bad movies","Yeah, Mary-Kate and Ashley made a lot of money splitting the role of Michelle Tanner on Full House (1987-1995), but they continued to rake in beaucoup bucks when the popular sitcom ended. Their net worth in 2018 was an estimated $400 million combined. How have these child stars remained rich when so many of their peers have struggled?","The twins earned much of their fortune making unintentionally laughable direct-to-video movies \u2014 45 to be exact, according to Elle. Their most famous film, New York Minute (2004), earned a dismal 11 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes \u2013 and the bulk of those percentage points are probably owed to co-star Eugene Levy \u2014 yet none of that stopped the movie from collecting more than $21 million worldwide. It's the same for much of their video oeuvre, which was largely ignored by critics. However, their 1995 collaboration with Steve Guttenberg and Kirstie Alley, It Takes Two, did garner enough attention to pull in 8 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes.","In spite of all the critical panning, Elle claims that the twins' film career raked in a startling $750 million dollars. Call us crazy, but we'd trade in every bad review ever written in exchange for that kind of scratch.","The Mary-Kate - Heath Ledger connection","It seems to have been forgotten over the years that Mary-Kate was somehow linked with actor Heath Ledger's death in 2008. While there was never any suggestion of foul play, Mary-Kate's name was involved from the moment the Dark Knight star's body was discovered. When Ledger's masseuse found him unconscious in his New York City home, the first person she called was Mary-Kate, twice, instead of 911.","According to the Daily Mail, when the masseuse finally determined she should reach out to the authorities, Mary-Kate \"sent over her security team who arrived at [Ledger's] flat at the same time as the ambulance.\" Stranger still, multiple news sources reported that Mary-Kate refused to talk to federal investigators about Ledger's death unless she was granted immunity. Why was she so concerned about being implicated for something? Did it have anything to do with Ledger's accidental overdose on prescription pills?","Her attorney, Michael C. Miller, denied she had anything to hide. \"Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them,\" Miller said in a statement.","Mary-Kate's stonewall tactic eventually worked when the DEA and federal prosecutors closed the inquiry into Ledger's death in August of 2008. \"The U.S. Attorney of the Southern District decided not to serve Olsen with a subpoena,\" a source told the New York Daily News, which effectively let Olsen off the hook for any further speculation.","Opioid crisis? What opioid crisis?","The Olsens are now successful fashion designers. With multiple clothing labels to their name, the twins offer everything from affordable children's clothing all the way up to haute couture. And while they kicked off their careers with threads sold exclusively at Walmart, they really shot to the top of the catwalk when they unleashed a $55,000 pill-covered handbag associated with their label The Row in 2012.","That's right, these two helped create a black crocodile leather backpack covered with prescription pills and called it high fashion. According to Entertainment Weekly, the must-have accessory for the fashionable pharma rep was the result of a collaboration with artist Damien Hirst, whose pill-centric work was previously featured in some of his other installations, called Pill Cabinets. So you should be sensing a theme here, is what we're getting at.","At any rate, this ghastly accessory celebrating drug culture seems even more offensive considering Mary-Kate's rumored connection to the celebrity drug scene, not to mention Ledger's overdose on prescription drugs. The good news: they only made 12 of them, so not only were their ill-gotten earnings likely capped at $660,000, which, let's be honest, is a drop in the bucket to their nearly half billion dollar fortune, but also there's a good chance you'll never encounter one of these abominations strapped to someone's back in real life.","Mary-Kate looks...different","For most of their adult lives, the Olsen twins looked like younger, pint-sized versions of Cameron Diaz, but around November 2014, people began noticing just how different Mary-Kate looked compared to her younger self and her fraternal twin sister. Naturally, the plastic surgery rumors flew, with some gossip sites even claiming Ashley had altered her appearance, too.","In 2017, the plastic surgery chatter kicked into high gear again after the Olsens showed up to the MET Gala (above), where Mary-Kate once again bore the brunt of the speculation. It should be said, however, that the tabloid Life & Style did its best approximation of due diligence when it consulted with a plastic surgeon (who hadn't treated either twin) about possible work Mary-Kate had done. His conclusion? Smoking and\/or bad makeup and lighting is to blame for her gaunt face. Mystery solved.","The ladies rarely talk about their personal lives and have certainly not fielded questions about cosmetic surgery, but don't worry, because unethical plastic surgeons who are willing to speculate on patients they've never treated just to get their name mentioned in a national publication are never in short supply.","Olsens to Paltrow: 'Hold our beer'","The Olsen twins were asked by Elle to recommend some Christmas gift ideas in 2014. Perhaps unsurprisingly, they exclusively suggested items from their boutique Los Angeles shop, The Row. The real shock came with the sticker prices on some of the items, or more accurately, the lack of prices, since everything was listed as \"price upon request,\" whatever that means. (Expensive. It means very expensive.)","Exactly how much do the Olsen twins expect someone to pay for a rare Van Cleef lighter or a deck of vintage playing cards? We'll probably never know, but we feel that we should point out that versions of both of those things can be purchased at virtually any convenience store for around $1.","Are the items in their shop actually worth their mysterious, but surely exorbitant prices, or are the Olsen twins just trying to give Gwyneth Paltrow and her Annual GOOP Gift Guide \u2014 with its similarly market-priced personal submarine \u2014 a run for its money?","Fuller House remains one pair shy","Portraying Michelle Tanner on Full House was undeniably the starting point for all of the Olsen twins' fame, but when the cast signed on to be in the sequel series, Fuller House, the Olsen twins were the only ones to decline. While it's understandable that they want to take their lives in a different direction, it doesn't seem too much to ask for the Olsens to at least make a cameo as a nod to the fans and co-stars that cemented their lives of leisure and luxury.","The reclusive duo did sort of share its reasons for skipping the reunion. According to show producer Bob Boyett, \"Ashley said, 'I have not been in front of a camera since I was 17, and I don't feel comfortable acting,'\" and \"Mary-Kate said, It would have to be me because Ash doesn't want to do it. But the timing is so bad for us.\"","Amazingly, Full House and Fuller House creator Jeff Franklin doesn't consider the snub a burned bridge, although he did tell Us Weekly that after three years of rebuffed invitations to join the show, he's done asking. \"But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show,\" Franklin said, adding, \"So that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open.\"","Elizabeth Olsen is no long lost twin","Actress Elizabeth Olsen took a bit longer than her older sisters to breakout as an actress \u2014 21 years to be exact. But taking time before diving into the acting world isn't the only difference between Elizabeth and the twins.","Where Mary-Kate and Ashley are reclusive and cagey, Elizabeth is outgoing, vivacious, and comes off like an extremely well-adjusted regular person who just happens to act really, really well. Baby sister's resume also creates a significant difference between her and her sisters. Elizabeth never dabbled in cheesy tween fare. She went straight to critically-acclaimed indies, such as Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011), then on to mega-hits such as Godzilla (2014), The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), and Captain America: Civil War (2016).","Elizabeth is also no stranger to the red carpet and interviews, and she displays a remarkable savvy about how to navigate A-List fame while maintaining her personal life. \"It comes quite easily,\" she told Vogue. \"I don't know if that comes from growing up in LA and having so many examples around me all the time. It's something that I watched people doing well growing up.\"","Clearly, she wasn't referencing Mary-Kate and Ashley, who famously, and hilariously failed at hiding from the paparazzi so often that artist Laura Collins created a whole exhibit around their antics. We know we're going to sound like nagging parents here, but seriously, Mary-Kate and Ashley, would it kill you to be a little more like your sister?","Mary-Kate's Kool wedding","There are few details about the notoriously press-shy Mary-Kate's wedding, but like many things in the eccentric twins' life, one tidbit leaked from the nuptials left everyone scratching their heads.","Page Six reported that a source said there were \"bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes, and everyone smoked the whole night,\" which is bizarre, especially since it took place in Manhattan, where for years smokers have been shunned into shameful, huddled groups as far away from the general public as possible. Then again, Mary-Kate married Olivier Sarkozy, a french billionaire, so maybe the cigs and the laissez-faire attitude sort of do make sense. But what about the other details?","Page Six also reported that guests, of which there were only 50, \"were required to turn in their cellphones\" before a cocktail reception and indoor dinner at \"a private residence on 49th Street, between Second and Third avenues.\" Actually, that all seems completely in line for a woman who once said, \"We've stayed quite sheltered.\" Okay fine, that was Ashley, but you get our point.","They are living pop culture artifacts","After becoming enamoured with the few details surrounding Mary-Kate's wedding, Olsen enthusiasts Viviana Olen and Matt Harkin decided to open a pop-up museum dedicated to the strange public persona of the twins. According to a 2016 story in The Huffington Post, the venue mostly features paintings of paparazzi photos of Mary-Kate and Ashley hiding their faces, but it also has other wacky features like \"a phone that only takes calls from Candace Cameron Bure offering parts on Fuller House\" and a recreation of Mary-Kate's wedding tablescape of cigarettes.","There's definitely a tongue-in-cheek aspect to the attraction, which is why the curators have also published a companion magazine, which is basically just photos of the paintings with funny captions: \"Here we see an Olsen coming to one of two realizations: that she will have to close a car door herself (for some reason) or that her outfit only works sitting down.\" Hopefully, the Olsen twins are as big a fan of self-deprecation as they are of nicotine.","Alexa, tell the Olsen twins they sound like snobs","In a profile in The New York Times about the launch of the Row \u2014 the Olsen twins' super high-end clothing store, Ashley admitted she \"has never purchased anything online,\" while Mary-Kate bought something once \"at an online auction.\" We're just going to assume it was a Jesse & The Rippers CD autographed by John Stamos because that's the only way we'll feel like these ladies are somewhat relatable humans after reading about their ridiculous store.","The Times story includes the following descriptions about their boutique: \"They convinced Masa Takayama, the renowned sushi chef, to sell them his ceramics,\" and \"Indeed, the store feels more like a tastefully appointed manse than a traditional retail shop, its individual rooms decorated with marquee art (a Basquiat here, a Borge Jorgensen sculpture there) and significant furniture.\" ","Cool, so we're guessing no clearance rack, right? How about layaway, because if we can do $5 on that Jorgensen, we'll totally be back next week with the rest.","Did they build a billion-dollar brand on the backs of overworked interns?","Former intern Shahista Lalani spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the Olsen twins' Dualstar Entertainment Group after she felt her duties went beyond the acceptable scope of an internship. According to Page Six, lead plaintiff Lalani and about 40 interns past and present claim they were treated poorly and not compensated for their extremely long hours. Though Lalani admits the Olsen twins were nice during her brief encounters with them, she feels the company the twins built did not handle its interns properly. And she has a point. How do coffee runs, data entry, or making photocopies educate students who are volunteering their time to learn about fashion design?","According to court documents obtained by Radar, the twins tried to reach a confidential settlement with the plaintiffs, which would have ostensibly allowed them to avoid the publicity of a trial and the additional shady dealings it may uncover. But in March of 2017, the terms of the settlement were made public, and the Olsen twins agreed to pay $140,000 to the approximately \"180 present and past interns\" who were eligible, according to E! News. After legal fees, that leaves a whopping $530 per intern who allegedly wasted their entire internship on mundane office work and didn't learn anything about fashion.

We\u2019ve all got that one that we just hate, purely because it looks like something they let the work experience kid draw on a Friday evening when nobody else could be bothered. I can guarantee you it didn\u2019t take a whole day to design a ditto, did it?","So, we\u2019ve trawled through all six generations of Pokemon to find the ones that are just bad designs. Who ever came up with some of these needs to share what they\u2019re smoking!","Klefki","So we\u2019ll start with the Pokemon that inspired me to write this article because it\u2019s a bloody key ring! For Klefki it might be quite convenient, you\u2019d never lose your keys because they are part of your body. But it does absolutely nothing for me in the design department. There are a couple more Pokemon like this, where it seems as though the design team have sat in the office playing \"Eye Spy\" until they find an object they could attach a personality to it. And of all things, they chose a bunch of keys? Each to their own.","Rotom","I\u2019m trying to get my head around this one because it\u2019s just such a strange concept. The description of Rotom on Bulbapedia (yes, Pokemon Wiki) goes as follows:","So it just turns into white goods whenever it feels like it purely for the purpose of changing it\u2019s power type. It just astounds me that stuff like this manages to get all the way to the game and TV series without anybody going \"Hang on, has anyone else realised this Pokemon is pointless?\"","But it keeps happening.","Luvdisk","This Pokemon that I could get on board with, if it hadn\u2019t been drawn by what appears to be an under-imaginative child. The concept is pretty nice","it\u2019s a Water-type Pokemon with a fish-like appearance, shaped like a heart. So much more could have been done with that brief than what we\u2019ve got! There\u2019s no fins or seemingly anything that could be used to propel the creature through water, and the super-necessary circle below the eye is almost laughable. The lost potential of this Pokemon has landed it on my list.","Unknown (Unown)","The flying alphabet which seemingly has little functions apart from the ability of flight and group telepathy, but there\u2019s 28 of them regardless","including a question and exclamation mark. Again, this feels like a feeble attempt to introduce a new Pokemon with not much thought put into it. I\u2019m just waiting for the generation where they\u2019ll add a mysterious set of number Pokemon, which is seeming increasingly likely.","Vanilluxe","Another one of my favourites because it\u2019s just so awful. Yes, as you can see above, it\u2019s an ice-cream cone! The designers thought this Ice Pokemon was such a good idea in fact, that Vanilleuxe is the third evolution (after Vanillite and Vanillish) to be featured in the game. I find this one lazy because they\u2019ve added a scoop of ice-cream to resemble the evolution (similar to Dugtrio, Dodrio, etc.)","and because it was a terrible ide, to begin with, and they\u2019ve managed to scrape three new Pokemon out of it.","Jynx","What even was this supposed to be in the first place? A terrifying large-bosomed-womanhood made for mankind. Jynx makes my list for being just plain creepy.","Cofagrigus","Another one of those that\u2019s just a bit, why? It\u2019s a haunted coffin with four black spaghetti arms and a face on its forehead. All in all, it just looks a bit silly. In its description on Bulbapedia, it says the Pokemon lives in ruins and can swallow up nearby people. Well, now I\u2019m scared.","Voltorb","The award for the laziest Pokemon design ever has to go to Voltorb. This electric Pokemon resembles something pretty similar to another element of the game \u2013 it\u2019s just a Pokeball with eyes!","Dedenne","Dedenne earned its place because it\u2019s so obviously a failed attempt to recreate the much-loved logo and everyone\u2019s favourite, Pikachu. Everything down to the bright cheeks and zig-zagged tail screams cheap imitation \u2013 and nobody can replace our Pika!","Druddigon","Award for the most poorly drawn dragon Pokemon goes to Druddigon. The colours are pretty nasty, and I reckon those blue leaves that are supposed to be wings wouldn\u2019t hold the rest of the weight. I kind of feel sorry for him, being so awkward and all. Looking like Charizard\u2019s unloved cousin can\u2019t be all that much fun.","Exeggutor","It\u2019s quite hard to understand what Exeggutor is all about, considering its predecessor is a row of eggs with a name that connotes to eggs, and then it evolves into some coconut tree. What, how does that happen? I\u2019ve never heard of coconuts hatching from eggs but in the Pokemon world, anything seems possible.","Garbodor","It\u2019s pretty hard to pick the worst of the list, as you can imagine but I think I\u2019ve found it in, Garbador.

She lived her best life and in the process, taught us quite a bit about relationships before she died at age 79 in 2011.","In honor of what would have been her 85th birthday, here are nine things we learned about love from Liz, the fiercest old Hollywood dame of all. ","\"I don\u2019t pretend to be an ordinary housewife. I am not and couldn\u2019t be,\" the mom of four once remarked. And it was true \u2014 the actress was anything but ordinary. While her peers played the perfect housewife in photo spreads for Life and Look magazines, La Liz made no bones about her career ambition and racked up husbands like it was NBD at a time when divorce wasn\u2019t nearly as accepted as it is now. She was seriously a woman before her time.","Taylor\u2019s fifth (and sixth!) husband Richard Burton waxed poetic about his wife in his private diaries:","\"She is shy and witty, she is nobody\u2019s fool, she is a brilliant actress, she is beautiful beyond the dreams of pornography,\" he wrote. \"She can be arrogant and willful, she is clement and loving, Dulcis Imperatrix, she is Sunday\u2019s child, she can tolerate my impossibilities and my drunkenness, she is an ache in the stomach when I am away from her, and she loves me!\"","Yeah, we think we could get used to someone fawning over us like that.","You would think things would have been awkward between Elizabeth Taylor and the late Debbie Reynolds after Eddie Fisher left Reynolds for Taylor (the couple\u2019s longtime friend) in 1959. Instead, the two women remained pals until Taylor\u2019s death in March 2011.","\"Women liked her and men adored her \u2014 my husband included \u2014 and her love for her children is enduring,\" Reynolds told Entertainment Weekly after Taylor\u2019s passing. \"People always assume you\u2019re going to carry a grudge, but I don\u2019t do that. We passed through that with time.\"","Taylor reportedly accepted a pave diamond-heart necklace after one of her legendary screaming matches with Burton. It would have been rude not to accept, right?","\"I suppose when they reach a certain age some men are afraid to grow up,\" Dame Elizabeth once remarked. \"It seems the older the men get, the younger their new wives get.\" We know the type. Still, if Taylor taught us anything about love, it\u2019s that there are plenty of fish in the sea, so if the person you\u2019re with doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re young or pretty enough, tell them to get lost.","Disagreements are an inevitable part of any relationship. Taylor and Burton were so prepared for them, they would reportedly rent three suites when they checked into hotels \u2015 one above and another below their own. That way, the couple figured, their neighbors would be spared if one of their infamous lovers\u2019 quarrels broke out.","\"I\u2019ve always admitted that I\u2019m ruled by my passions,\" Taylor said. No kidding. When it came to love, Liz was insatiable \u2014 so much so that the Vatican accused her of \"erotic vagrancy\" when she took up with Burton, her married co-star in the 1966 film \"Cleopatra.\" After that, the couple lived out a totally epic whirlwind romance: marrying in 1964, making up after epic fights time and time again, and eventually divorcing in 1974... only to remarry in a private African ceremony sixteen months later.","\"Maybe we loved each other too much,\" Elizabeth said, as if such a thing were possible.","But what if a relationship doesn\u2019t work out? We\u2019ve always been partial to Taylor\u2019s advice on getting over someone: \"Pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.\" \ud83d\ude4c"],"targetTitle":"9 Things Elizabeth Taylor Taught Us About The Art Of Love","targetDescription":"Liz Taylor was basically the goddess of love.  \ud83d\udc96","targetKeywords":"Relationships,Marriage,celebrity relationships,romance movies,Elizabeth Taylor","targetMedia":null,"targetUrl":null,"id":390}

It is something much more basic than party preference.\u2019 \u2018An election between the Democrat Clinton and, let\u2019s say, the Republican Jeb Bush or John Kasich or Marco Rubio, even the hyper-ideological Ted Cruz, would spark a much-needed debate about the role of government and the nation\u2019s future, about each candidate\u2019s experience and abilities.

I do all the time. Taking risks and going places you aren\u2019t supposed to is a great adrenaline rush. Now, I\u2019m not trying to promote trespassing of any kind. I\u2019m a responsible adult....sometimes. The excitement of the unknown is what drives many people\u2019s curiosity when they decide to finally give urban exploring a try. Maybe you\u2019ll see a ghost, or find an abandoned safe. It\u2019s never the same thing twice though. You really don\u2019t have any idea what you\u2019re going to find or discover. Well that was the driving force behind a man named Dan Bell and his recent decision to explore an abandoned apartment complex. It started out as a simple urban exploration video, but turned into something much more life-threatening in mere moments. Check out the pictures and video he captured, and how this attempt at urban exploration was almost his last.","He starts out his journey in a small alleyway formed by the abandoned building. This place looks like something out of a horror movie.","Dan had passed by this scary abandoned apartment for a few weeks, and just couldn\u2019t seem to get it off his mind.","Dan had found blood and animals parts around different part of the property in a previous shorter visit. He had also found summoning markings around certain parts of the property. As with all great urban explorers however, this only made his curiosity grow with every step.","He climbed a ladder to reach an upper level of the apartment complex. Inside he found what you would expect to find in an old abandoned building.","Trash was littered through the maze of rooms and hallways. The paint was peeling off of every single wall, while some walls weren\u2019t even standing anymore. Every step he took was a gamble that the floor would support his weight.","The remnant of what used to be tenants mail boxes for their apartments. This place definitely fell into serious decay after it was not longer being used.","Falling debris was a definite worry while walking through this place. It\u2019s so old the wood is rotting and won\u2019t support the weight it used too.","It became clearer and clearer that people had been in here after the place was abandoned. Apparently \"Tony\" wanted everyone to know he was there at one point.","Finding a spot to step onto without the threat of a nail in your foot was quite the exercise.","A tense moment came when Dan took a step, and the ground beneath him literally started to crumble and disintegrate. It\u2019s a tense moment in an already tense video. He was extremely lucky that the floor never caved in on him during his visit.","After walking through the upper levels for a bit, Dan decides to climb back down the ladder and tackle the ground level floors. This would be a turning point in the video. What happens next is something that I would never want to experience.","Dan decided to check out an area up a flight of stairs. When he reached the top, he caught sight of something that just didn\u2019t seem to fit with the rest of his surroundings.","Just an ordinary reusable grocery bag right. The Snapple sticking out of the bag makes it seem like it was definitely put here recently. Of course, someone who has already come this far is going to investigate even further!","Well damn! That\u2019s a bunch of crack cocain ready to be sold! As soon as I saw this, my mood about this situation would have changed. This isn\u2019t just a poke around an abandoned building anymore.","After examining the contents of the container, Dan understandably got seriously freaked out. This was clearly a crack house, and he was standing there with a dealers stash. People have gotten killed for less. Well guess what? The dealer comes back!","Pretty damn intense right?! This guy is seriously super lucky. I don\u2019t have a doubt in my mind if these guys would have found him he would be dead. This building is definitely in the slums. If you watch the whole video, at around the 5:07 mark, you can clearly hear multiple gun shots ringing through the air in the general area. That right there would have probably be enough for me to say it\u2019s time to go. Luckily Dan was able to wait out the crack dealer and his client and make a hasty getaway.

{"postId":"4u2aq3","postText":["Here's a controversial idea about China's economy that no one wants to hear"],"postPlatform":"reddit","targetParagraphs":["Reuters","For years, economists have been saying that China needs to \"rebalance\" its economy, and the government is on board with this daunting project.","That means the country is attempting to move from an economy based on investment in industrial manufacturing to one based on domestic consumption driven by regular Chinese people working in the services sector.","That is, China has been moving toward fewer coal miners and construction workers in favor of more bankers and shopkeepers.","But what if we've got this all wrong? What if China is transitioning too early? That's what HSBC economists Qu Hongbin and Jing Li have posited in a recent note, \"China's new challenge: Faster services expansion, slower productivity growth.\"","From the note (emphasis added):","\"Both economic theory and empirical evidence suggest that premature deindustrialisation in developing countries can be damaging. It blocks the main channel of productivity growth, and therefore reduces the economy's potential growth rate and its prospects of catching up with more advanced economies.","\"Based on the experience of some Latin American countries, a lack of adequate investment and a tendency of specialising according to short-term, rather than long-term, comparative advantage are common mistakes made by developing countries.","\"This kind of development strategy can result in an underdeveloped industrial sector and slow productivity growth. Given that China's GDP per capita is only 14% that of the US, we believe it is way too early to shift towards services-led growth.\"","Work, work, work, work, work","What really worries HSBC is that the service sector's jobs, while in general more labor intensive, are less productive for the economy than jobs in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. The bank's analysts point out that workers in the former are just 80% as productive as those in the latter.","HSBC","Arguing against a shift to service-led growth is a super controversial thing because the Chinese government has already made rebalancing a top project \u2014 if not in deed, then certainly in word. The reason for that is simple: debt.","China has a debt-to-GDP ratio of over 280%. Most of that is concentrated in the industrial and manufacturing sectors. In 2009, when the world was falling apart, the Chinese government decided to just open the money spigots to keep its economy running at full steam.","That, coupled with a general lack of global demand for materials like steel and coal produced in Chinese factories, has led to overcapacity in those sectors.","So, to combat that overcapacity, China would like to have fewer people working the jobs where they're making the things that it seems the world has entirely too much of.","The rest of the world would love that, too. Last week, the US House of Representatives held a hearing on the Chinese economy , \"Evaluating the Financial Risks of China,\" and much of it focused on what that country's economic slowdown has done to the American steel industry.","During the hearing, Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, pointed out that 33 steel manufacturers have gone bankrupt since the 1990s. He also said that, between 2011 and 2015, the Chinese government claimed that 90 million tons of overcapacity in its steel market had been taken care of. In reality, 300 million tons had been added to China's steel output.","So what Gibson would like is for China to slow its production and wind the steel industry down.","The problem with this solution, says HSBC, is that moving away from industry and manufacturing means that China won't grow as fast \u2014 not just in the short term, but also in the long term.","From the note (emphasis added):","\"The efficiency loss during such a 'rebalancing' can be huge. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of migrant workers in the manufacturing sector declined by nearly 7m, compared with an increase of 5m in the three biggest services sectors (ie wholesale and retail, residential services, transportation and logistics). Based on 2015 statistics, each worker in the manufacturing sector generated RMB45,000 more output than their counterpart in the three biggest services sectors. Therefore, if all 5m workers had been employed in the manufacturing sector rather than services, China's total output in 2015 could have been RMB225bn higher, which is around 0.3% of annual GDP.\"","HSBC suggests that the country makes more targeted and productive investments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors.

In July, the plant thrives in wetlands, marshes and river banks across America, blooming with tiny clusters of white flowers. A few bites of the plant can kill a large dog in less than two hours.","A dog poisoned with water hemlock may first appear nervous and pupils will dilate. This will progress to twitching, drooling, convulsions and seizures. If a tiny amount was eaten and dogs survive the toxic effects, they are often left with permanent heart or skeletal muscle damage. If dogs eat too much and don't get medical help quickly, this can be followed by respiratory paralysis and death.","If your dog does eat hemlock, it's necessary to induce vomiting and get him to the vet immediately."],"targetTitle":"Dog Dies One Hour After Hiking With His Owner, Veterinarian Gives Shocking Reason Why","targetDescription":"It was a routine walk for one Colorado woman and her dog, but it ended in tragedy.

Clear skin or acne you are the same person. I get asked how can I be confident when my skin looks like this? The reason I decided to accept myself for how I looked is because for years I suffered with acne and for years I let my mental health take over, ruin relationships, stop me going out ect all because I was insecure and worried about other people's opinions. Because let's be honest acne isn't nice to look at. I knew I couldn't carry on being this hard on myself to the point I would cry and have a lot of built up stress causing headaches. I thought about the days when I used to have no worries when I was younger and here's what I came up with- I wasn't living life trying to impress anyone I wore no makeup so never felt less beautiful I didn't spend my time trying to make myself look perfect I didn't sit at home comparing myself to others on Instagram It's the world we live in today that makes us think like this. I don't want young girls feeling the same way I did. I don't want them to think they have to look a certain way to be accepted or beautiful.

The files are encrypted with a code so strong it\u2019s unbreakable, even by governments. If anything happens to Assange or the website, a key will go out to unlock the files. There would then be no way to stop the information from spreading like wildfire because so many people already have copies. \"What most folks are speculating is that the insurance file contains unreleased information that would be especially embarrassing to the U.S. government if it were released,\" said Declan McCullagh, chief political correspondent for CNET, a CBS company.","Not long after the mysterious tweets appeared in October 2016, a Twitter account associated with Anonymous asserted that they were not indicative of harm coming to Assange \u2014 he was presumably, fine and the tweets were a form of data integrity verification:","Clarification: Wikileaks tweeted out sha256sum coded messages, not deadman keys. Assange is fine as far as we know. Carry on. \u2014 Anonymous (@YourAnonNews) October 17, 2016","A Gizmodo article described the series of tweets and their less ominous potential purpose:","Much as these tweets provide great fodder for conspiracy speculation, the secret to their meaning is hidden in plain sight. \"Pre-commitment\" in this case is a references to a cryptographic scheme to prevent unreleased information from being tampered with. Essentially those unique codes are proof to anyone reading the documents in the future that their contents remain unchanged: alteration to the leaks will likewise alter those 64-character codes. The same strategy was used by Tor Project developer Andrea Shepard in a warning shot that may have helped reveal years of Jacob Applebaum\u2019s sexual misconduct. Likewise, Edward Snowden tweeted (and quickly deleted) a similar code in August, though its meaning remains uncertain. A torrent file and accompanying SHA-512 hash was even used by someone on Reddit\u2019s r\/SilkRoad to share sensitive forum information. The tweets from Wikileaks appear to be in line with these prior examples\u2014and surely a true \"dead man\u2019s switch\" unleashing all the data Assange currently possesses would amount to much more than three measly leaks.","WikiLeaks regularly tweets about Assange\u2019s status and whereabouts, and shortly after the cryptic tweets were posted, WikiLeaks proclaimed that a \"state actor\" had cut off Assange\u2019s Internet connection at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where Assange had remained since seeking asylum from that country in June 2012:","Julian Assange\u2019s internet link has been intentionally severed by a state party.
